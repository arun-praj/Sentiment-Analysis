sentiment,review
1,I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this
1,Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game

1, works fine great
1,Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection
0,I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works
0, Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this
0, DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features
1," Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"""
0," Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly"
1, Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe
0, Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke 
0, A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5)
1, TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
0, didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power
0, Don't buy!: First of all
1, Simple
1, Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99
1, SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas
1, Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
0, Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation
0, Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
1, one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
1, Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small
0, Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable
0, Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms
1, works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed
0, Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device
1, wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk
0, Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange
1, This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire
1, Mary Ash: Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
1, Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash
1, This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
1, They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time
0, Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
1, Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
0, Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants
1, Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do
0, Light reading
1, WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop
0, Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book
1, Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI
1, Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times
1, Amazing...: love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
1, Leslie in a nutshell: Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal
0, More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love
0, A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date
0, Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry
1, Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well
1," Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"""
1, Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell
0, 12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell
0, I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However
1, Wonderful
1, No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
0, Disappointment at it's extreme: I had never read this author
1, From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
1," An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the ""evil"" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give ""gifts"" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say"
1, great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie
1, Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
0, Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough
1," Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The ""sale"" prices are right for a high About end racquet"
0, A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
0, Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure
1, sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky
1, Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
0, Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy
0, Broke the 2nd time I wore it
1, The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture
1, Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core
1, I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6
0, WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach
0, CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off
0, Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
0, nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
1, Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while
0, conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist
0, Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development
0, 1
1, Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
1, I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
1, A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing
0, where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
0," Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.""There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language"
0, ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
1, The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
0, This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so
1, Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
0, A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great
0, Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer
1, Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston
0, Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
0, Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor
1," The ""Scarlet"" Letter: Much to my amazement"
1, The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser 
0, The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book
1, This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter
0, I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
1, Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow
0, same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap
1, Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small
0, Unreadable!: As good as this book may be
0, Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance
0, Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree
0, one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz
1, Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie
0, very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie
0, Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids
0, Not the worst
0, Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have
1," It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board"
1, Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition
1, great IMO: First of all
1, I wish...: ...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
1, Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg
0, WOW!: This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability
1, 80s Hard Rock: One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
0, Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80's died
1, Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review
1, Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
1, Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
1, There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest
1," I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! ""They don't know entertainment"" as Krusty would say: I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"""
1, Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
1, Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music
1, great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
1, Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
1, The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this
1, Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself
0, Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides
0, After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months
1, Works great
1, This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop
1, Quite Satisfactory: This product works well
1, Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price
1, Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging
0, Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
0, Cheap
1, So much better than the apple version!: I love it
1, Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply
0," If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14""). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery"
0, Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4
0, Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package
1, Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family
1, TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente
1," Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull"
0, book only
1, Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
0, Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension
0, Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology
0, Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider
0, Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper
1, Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever
1, My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much
1, Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception
0, I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
1, Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch
1, Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white
1, A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason
1, I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
1, Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
1, Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
1," Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's ""Hungry Again"
1, Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child
0, Band saves CD: As usual
1, Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5
1, The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
1, non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him
0, worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
1, One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old
1, excellent: Good price
1, Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends
0, Maybe next time...: I
1, To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome
0, Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released
0, Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0, Great Work
1, this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout
0, Good
0, a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material
0, BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
0, Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to
0, Well
0, Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0," Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this"
1, The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times
1, Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome
0, elem diff e-q's: While the shipping was AMAZING
1, This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
0, Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade
1, A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people
0, Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?: I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small
1, Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch
0," Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8"" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger"
1, The meaning of God
0, What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it
0, You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set
0, junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
1, fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
0, Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
1, Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river
0, Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking
0, Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages
0, Stuck With You: I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book
1, None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed
1, Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included
1, Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted
0, lousy
0, Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
1, Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book
0, broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
0," Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the ""ON"" button"
0, Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow
1, Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
0, THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE
1, Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod
1, LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent
1, CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
0, I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful
0, More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction)
0, waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use
1, CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
1, Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all
0," ""THE ROCKETS RED GLARE"" ???: This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on"
1," Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of ""shaky"" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price"
1, A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible
0, Love Jerry and Dean
0, Crap
1, Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings
1," I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: ""For office slaves"
1, An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
0, not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However
1, Typical Thomas video
0, Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also
0, Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
1, Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth
1," ""Like this"" by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic ""clean up the ghetto"". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus"
0, A Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter
1, A peek inside the process.: First thing's first
1, As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad
1, a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history
0, Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer
1, Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product
1, Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
1," I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found ""Quaker Oat Bran"" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too."
1, Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print
1, Its a cable: Its a cable
1, awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
1, I'm grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime
1, Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian
1, Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me
0, USA1: Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
1, Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial
0, This book is messed up: In this book
1, Impressive: One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore
1, The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
0, Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected
0," SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!: Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel"
0, And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot
0, Mothman proficies ?: 257 pages covering Men in Black
0, Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this
0, Are you joking?: I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction
0," fine if you support terrorism: I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up"

1, So Original
0, noritake colorwave stoneware: I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it

0, Tiene que ser sensilla!!: Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama
0, Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead
0, Worst book I've ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was)
1, Frankenstein Continued??: When I first heard about this book
0, Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers
0, My [Goodness]!!!!: world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire

1," hard -to-find tension rods: Our living room has a ""bow"" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you."
1, YES
1, A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
1, Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided 
0, If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.: I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album
0, Ehh: The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
0," ""True"" Nirvana sucks: I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are ""illegal"". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is ""true"" Nirvana"
0, garbage: Complete garbage
0, Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.
1, Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color
1, Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader
0," The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word ""ficbe"" came about as a result of faulty character recognition"
0, Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well
0, Lame Jujitsuka: I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them
0, Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and
1, Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third): In the forest of Midworld
1, Best Alan Dean Foster book!: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen
0, Plain Putrid: This book is so obscene in some parts
0," Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video"
0, Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
0, Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
0, The book was boring
1, Obligatory: My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
1, Good Companion Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
1, Great classic: I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations
1, Beautifully written
0, I hated this book then....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there
0, Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition
0, Ummm: I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
1," Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
1, Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression
0, Please read Kundera's book instead: Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing
1, Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film
1, Milan Kundera rides again...: A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book
0, Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
0, The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler): Basically
0," disappointed: I have been very impressed by other ""pickin on"" music: Lynyrd Skynyrd"
1, The birth of Drone??: As far as I know
1, Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life
1, Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new
1, Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo
1, Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author)
1, On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot
0, Flat Kerouac: I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty
0," Self Indulgent Nonsense: The operative word from the title is ""bums"". This is a book about them and their self indulgent"
0, Outlines of Theology
1, Life changing!: This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
0, not worth it: mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
0, WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it
0, Not really a good movie: This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover
1, transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
1, Loved It!: I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
1, Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME

0, Another 'video game' type of movie
0, Great eye candy
0, Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
0, Transformers: Dark of the Moon: By most accounts
0, The movie itself is ok
0, The perfect movie
0, Lights out on this awful film: I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot
0, Not that great: The first transformers movie will always be the best one
0, Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12: I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably
1, Love this movie: Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
0, Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact
1, Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner
1, Transformers Dark of the Moon: A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
0, Movie is ok
1, Guys Movie: So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions
0, Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!: I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime
1, Transformers: Dark of the Moon: watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
0, Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....: I know a lot of movies aren't going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers
0, Safety pins: As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
0, Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler: Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
1, B-Movie-Licious: I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised
0, Hell no.: Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it
0, What a complete and utter waste of time
0, Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!: I've had many problems with Sony computer items before
1, Sony E-Marker is now obsolete: Excellent Product
1, good idea
0, Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented
0, worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing
0, Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through
0, Sony has pulled the plug: Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However
0, Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
0, Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately
0, Artwork???: Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
0, Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid
0," ""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations: While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same"
0, The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...: I was very disappointed to discover that the copies
0, Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster
0, Tongue hurt my ankle: The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately
0, Buy the 1993 version instead.: I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns
1, Protection Advice: All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about
0, know the source of your information: While there is some very good information in the book
1, Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.: We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that
1, Viewed it yesterday: This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
0, Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film
1, Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out
0, it sounds great!~!~!~!~!: it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
1, It's a very reliable printer...: I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is
0, Grindhouse?: I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
0, Am I missing something?: Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it)
1, Is honesty always rewarded ?: Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty
1, LOVE THIS BOOK: I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
1, Awesome if not overplayed: The first 5 songs are incredible
1, A Great CD for all people: I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus
1, Beyond the mega-hit
1, It's Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
0, The One Star: The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually
0," I won't buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
0, Non Computer Geek: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER
0, Curved Thomas the Train tracks: Again
0, O-o-okay: Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then
1, Heads above the first book in the trilogy: I was so disappointed in the first book
1, Good book: I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say
1, Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy
1, Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation
0, Good politics
1, Asimow is one of the best writers of all times: Foundation
1, Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre
0, Don't Bother: Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However
0, tough going: I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally
0, Dissatified: I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series
0," Goes ""Haywire"" Regularly: Setup was easy enough"
1, Old fashioned
0, Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
0, worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10
0, Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie
0, LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
0, What did I watch?: So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
1, Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest
1, If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker
0, Banal and Boring: No
1, GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
1, Amazing Score.: Wow
0, Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design
1, Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
0," It's too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of ""dummie"" and ""KISS"" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste."
1, Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables
0, awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
1, Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks
0," Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called ""classic"" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book"
1, entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
1, one more positive note: Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls
0, Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks
1, This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia
1, Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times
0, AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest
1, Oh
1, Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray
1, Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
1, Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture 
1, Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
1, Well Played Kid's Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music
0, Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor
1, well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are
0, Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
1, Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned
1, These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says
1, Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war
1, Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush
1, Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
1, You'll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped
1," Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of ""Lament"" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song ""Beuonos Aires"" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less."
1, EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
0, Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams
1, A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up
0, A small leak
0, Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning
1, It's a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate
1, Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item
1, comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling
0, Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
1, Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
1, Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable
0, Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm
0, It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated
0, Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins
1, Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento
0, WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING
0," Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"""
1, Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all
0, Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak
1, Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
1, Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student
1, Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in
1, Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town
1, Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
1," Its better then a ""normal"" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated"
0, Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
1, Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use
1, great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
0, Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence
0, Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009
1, The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
1, Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick
1, Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself
1," Step's Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD ""Standing Room Only."" ""I'm So Glad"" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a ""must buy"" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco"
1, 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways
1, DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
0, Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
1, good: It was good
0, Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since
0, No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
0, Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews
1, GREAT prodct: For those wondering
0, Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated
0, Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature
0, Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty
0, HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
1, Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say
1, After 6 years
0, I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein
1, Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
1," Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her ""dialouges"" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs"
0, Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok
0, misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also
0, Waste of money: If you get to this review
0, What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
0, Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day
0, Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly
1, Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
1, Romeo and Juliet
0, Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
1, A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story
0, RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things
0, Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos
0, How do films like this get made?: If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film
0, What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous
0, Cute
0, Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree
0, no color
1, Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But
0, Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy
0, A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball
0, MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say
0, Lies
0, REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau
1, I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter
0, sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit
0, Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended
0," Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However ""Hope"" is far too theatrical"
1, A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
1, A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings
1," One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever"
1, GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book
1, Great space heater!: It swivels
1," Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of ""Portrait of a Marriage"" years ago"
0, Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
0, This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However
0, Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog
1," a childhood favorite: In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital"
1, Forget Belkin
1, Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you
1, Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book
1, Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts
0, complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions
0, bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving
0, does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
0, Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
0, Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better
0, Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use
1, Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store
1, Top Notch Christmas Jazz: I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard
0, review: The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy
0, Wow: I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning
1, Basketball
0, never again: I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on
0, Reaching for the Light: I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
0, Hardly worth reading: This book
1, Statin levels: Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins
0," DECEPCIONADO: Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil"
0, Excellent show
1, Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow): Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work
0, It does not use your classification for the musics.: I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover
0, Returned the View twice in one week: I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles
0, Worst mp3 player on the market.: I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please
1, Nice Device: This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 
1, This player is very very good: Wow
0, Don't buy without a good return policy.: This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
0, Don't buy this piece of crap: I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So
0," Nothing is from scratch?: Why on Earth would ""nothing is made from scratch"" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good"
1, Really funny and exciting: I'd say this book is extremely informative for the responsible
1, Good book: Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
1, Great History: I am a big fan of Ms. Blake's but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you're a fan of people and their cultures
1, Handy card holders: I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards
0, It does the job: If you can't hold the cards
1, Buy this now!: Very attractive
1, Forward the Mage an Alternate Style: Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais
1, Fantasy writing at its best: Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer
0, A device grows old: Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap
1, Cool Documentary: I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don't let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states
0, Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships: This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships
0, Jabra Eargels: The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
0, Jabra Ear Gels: These are not the same that come on the earbud
0, What a waste: Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something
1, Fast delivery
0, JABRA EAR GELS: Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
1, jabra eargels: These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
0, Don't waste your money: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone
0, Not well suited for the Jawbone II: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II
0, pain in the ear: They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically
1, JEG: The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
0, scottiesgems: I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
0, Don't waste your money: After ordering these eargels
0, This movie is not all that: originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star
0, Hmmmmmmm: I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well
0, Crap
1, The Odyssey with Armand Asanti: I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
0, Great movie
0, Very BORING: This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age
1, Birds
0, I Don't Think So!: Quite often
0, The white whale isn't: The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic & you can't do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.
0, Did not fit in ear: I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear
1, Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable
1, The Face of a Stranger: Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series
0, Waste of time and money: I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture
0, This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.: When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows
0, I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...: I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms
0, very much disappointed: It was just terrible for me
1, A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!: A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure
0, Terrible movie: I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it
0, Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....: What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy
0, under the Tuscany Sun: Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new
1, Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!: In this movie
0, Diane Lane is great but skip this movie: Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.
1," Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS: I think it's always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a ""replacement substitute"". The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours."
0, Here's what really happened...: The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version
0," A failure of ""Battlefield Earth"" proportions!: I should say"
0, TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!: This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible
0, Horrible.: I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
0, ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.: I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad
0, Junk
1, I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!: I ordered this
1, concisely written: This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
0, What the????: It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing
0, When Good Products Go Bad: I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that
0, Very disappointed: Although these sheets are pretty and warm
1, Very large: These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However
0, dont get it: Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
0, Not a good toy: This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
1," JBL MRX512M: JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new ""opened"" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product."
0, Good for downhill only: I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled
1, Pratchetts Best!!!!: Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works
1, Pratchett Review Haiku: I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
0, Why do people like this garbage?: Okay
0, Boring plot.: I liked what it was about
0, cross contamination: The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches
1, Just Accepting Gluten Free Life: I have read the other reviews of this book
0, Terrible!: My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately
0, get the facts: Most of the people who gave shining
1, Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !: What a wonderful
0, Not useful and a waste of money: The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
0," Devoid of depth or even much substance: The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability"
0, Try something else.: I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much
1, Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.: Charles Dickens
0, Less than one star.: Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him
0, Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game: I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET
1, Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise: A regular nail biter: strong plotlines
1, A Must Have: For those familiar with the Burzum name
1, Super Reader: An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos
0, Politics?: A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument
1, A Must for Handgunners - Old and New: This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No
0, Lousy Camera: This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree
0, Piece of junk: Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
1, Video too!: I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
1," Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the ""best"" of Motown"
1, Great true crime read: I really have to give this author credit
0, static central: Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices
0, I expected something better: EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors
0, Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC)
0, Freud is crazy!: I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks
1, If life is a dream
1, It arriived: Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
1," Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words"
1, When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?: Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I
0, Amazon.com sent wrong size: Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
1, One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly
1, Janet
1, Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am)
1, Captivating: Very simply
1, Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.: Yes
1, Great Information: My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
1, Good Overview and Very Informative: I really enjoyed this DVD
1, Superb!: When I was 5 months pregnant
1, Chilbirth Education Video: Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
0, TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart
1, GO FOR IT!: This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman
1, LOVED this video!: After I bought this DVD
1, RECOMMEND!: I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do
0, Couldn't finish watching: Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes
1, very informative: Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information
1, Poignant & Intelligent -- give this one a listen!: Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable
1, Exquisitely fresh
0, At least it's free: I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free
1, Yardbirds: Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story
1, One of my favorites...: ...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe
1, Nice French farce
1, Daniel Auteuil is fabulous: I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
0, This book is AWEFUL: I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story
1, Captivating and Engrossing: When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong
1," Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!: I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars"
1, one of the best series EVER!!!: When my dad first gave me this book to read
0, Giants Mats: The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
1, Exactly what I ordered: Product arrived on time
1, Touching: Beautiful film
1, One of the best foreign language films: For once
1, Wonderfully emotional.: Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
0, The remix is different: I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster
0, Why the remix?: If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10
0, Art and Passion...but no Science: A series of short vignettes about fencing
0, No illustrations: The Kindle version has no illustrations
0, No drawings!: I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book
1, what hard rock is all about: Cut the crap! it's motorhead
1, Thuvia maid of mars: Typical ERB Mars series
0, Old-School Bore Metal: This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal
0, Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients: If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that
1, A new beginning...: This was their first true recording project
0, Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item: Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners
0, It's an ad.: This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber's school/store in CakeEater
1, A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it: A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author
0, Flyboys: Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless
1," World War I aviation visited: I have enjoyed watching ""Flyboys"" several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end. I noticed that one of the people interviewed was from Colorado and as a result I went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie.I find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it."
1, fly boys: i haven't watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review
0, Sappy and Stupid: This is a very bad movie. Bad music
1," This CD Rulez: I think that this is one of the best CD's ever. I really like the song ""Gravity"" and ""Next Time"". Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must."
1," ""Souless Pop?"" Not here: When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the ""lou pearlman"" sound to it. (remember o-town??"" This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don't need anyone- 3Feelin' You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*"
1, Thank God: I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables
0, getting tired of the cliche: Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy
0, shameful ripoff: even in the hour plus ''build-up/charactor developement''.i guess talky
0, Great movie
0, How STUPED can you GET!: I'll tell you how stuped you can get
1, Mighty Ducks rulz: This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!
0," What's this?...: When i first heard his single ""One Wish"" i thought this is a good tune"
0, raydiation: Thank God he stopped rapping
1, WELL DONE RAY J.: This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album
1, Stew: Well I am.... I have to say in all honesty.... A true Magnum fan
0, don't waste your money: I love historical novels
1, Brilliant reinvention: Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol
0, Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT: This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is
0, Too bad it's boring: The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters
1, carnivale: Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky
0, Once again
0, Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb: After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb
0, Don't bother!: This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest
0," This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...: ...it's about being ""proud of being the first Danish woman to do so"" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady"
1, Best Show Around: Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???)
1, cj: It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
1, This is a great game for rookies
0, From the biggest CULT of all!: So someone from the biggest CULT of all
0, Pro?! Huh?: Not detail in explaining conceptsToo few numerical examplesContent far too simple to be a desktop ref. in the dealing rm.Poor editing and formatting90% similar to the earlier edition.
1, Good
0, I gave it a try...: Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original
0, Does not work on Windows XP!: Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center
1, if you love cats
0, terrible: Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
1," ""Hope"" may be a wrong concept.: I wonder"
1," A timeless classic that's an unforgettable must-read.: This is the timeless classic which the term ""Orwellian"" and""Big Brother"" are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government ""Big Brother"" holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell's vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen"
1, 1984: Orwell's futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence
0, 1984: 1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one
0, Not a helpful history book AT ALL: I was doing a research paper on the year 1984
1, TEACHERS??: I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son
1, If you haven't read it
1, Scary!: George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too
1, disturbing and relevant: I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant
1, The greatest work of the 20th Century: What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read
1, Orwel Rolls in His Grave: This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda
1, A Thoughtful Read: Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual
1, The title should be revised to say 2004!: With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI
0, George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked
1, two plus two makes FOUR!!!!: George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought
1, A Very Interesting Read: At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read
1, Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.: I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back
0, Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...: OK
0, 1984: I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up
1, masterpiece: I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course
1, 1984 as true today as in 1948: For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future
1, I thought the book was great.: I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.
1, When Already?: Like others here
0, Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.: I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air
0, :\: If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries
1, Like silky
0, He isn't what I remember.: The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD 
0, Need to proof read your work: This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
0, NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER: hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip
0, Waste of money: I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk
1, It is what is......: West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be
1, Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne's Best!: Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works
1, Wonderful story coupled with steamy
0, Stick with Sleeping Beauty: Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge
0, Vile from the beginning: Let me start by saying that I never put down a book
0, spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.: shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin
1, Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space: Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13
0, I HATE THIS BOOK: I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
0, Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?: If it is
0, NOT THAT GOOD: Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
1, Start memorizing this book.: I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple
1, dystopian classic: Wow
1," really good: this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
1, What a classic: To be perfectly honest
0, Didn't Like it!!: Confusing
1, A book with many levels: What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books
1, Fahrenheit 451: I read this book as a teenager
0, Great Book to read
0, DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!: This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow
0, Hardly even deserves 1 star: This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version
1, Captivating language
1, Ok: I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.
1, Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!: I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class
1," Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving"
1, It'll never go out of date: I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago
0, Bleak
0, Fahrenheit 451
0, Sadly a disappointment: Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended
1, F 451 shows how dangerous a person's ideas are.: I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general
1, A must read - especially for teenagers.: This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter
0, poor reading: I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!
1," Good: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world"
1, Explains a lot of things from the movie: The book was not so good as the movie
0, Fahrenheit 451: This book is pretty good
0, Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book
0, BURN THIS BOOK!: Hey A reader from MISSOURI
0, A Very Dark and Mysterious Book: I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally
0, I tried reading this book for my summer reading & it was bad: I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student. If you have a choice I wouldn't pick this one.
0, WASTE OF MY TIME: first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on
0, This is the lamest book I have ever read: This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
0, Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV
1, real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound
1, INTERESTING AND SAD! 
1, motorola phone car charger: product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient
1, It worked: Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
1, Well made product at fair price: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.
0, Not so good: It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places
0, battle weary: This game is horrible. The battles are so... long
1, chalinging game: this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it
0, Horrible Game: This game is boring. You can't follow the story line
0, why oh why does anyone play this: Yes this has good graphics
1, The Code of Dusty Fog: I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites
0, Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz: I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong
1, I Kept Waking Up My Husband......: I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.
1, High Quality For a Reasonable Price: I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions
0, Hallmark of the disposable society?: Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So
0, NO AVAILABILITY: My rating is for Amazon
0, poor quality DVD recording: movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but grainy.I guess you get what you pay for.
1, Interesting View Into British Culture: As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
1, Colin Firth...need one say more?: Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate
1, Ones to watch over and over: Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.
0, Sweet Revenge: This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn't watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.
0, Not worth the great price: Paying about $16 for this collection of 8 films could have been a great buy. I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite
0, Warning. I HIGHLY don't recommend this set!: You would have NO idea reading the description
1, Great card
1, Great card but difficult to setup: As the other reviews noted
0," same: Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"""
1, Louie's Goose: A good childrens' book
0, Trite story line with poor recipes: I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite
0, an unusual writing technique: Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus
0," self indulgent tripe: ""What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth""If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel"
0, My farts make more sense than Finnegans Wake: ye make a book
0," Naked Emperors: Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
0, Mad with Vanity: That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW
0, He's challenging us to doodle...: I give this book two stars because it's the first
1, Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!: Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity
1, Pocket chart: It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
1, Sraight-up raw emotions...: From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw
0, I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.: It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit
1, Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.: Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics
0," Worse than ""The Quest"": The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins"
1, I liked it
0, Imitation Brand: They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti
0, Not good for small dogs like lhasas: This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures
1, The Wild Thornberry's Movie: This game is so cool. I have only played it once
0, Disappointed: I am sure the story is fine
0, stargate continuum: the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
1, stargat continuam review by cvf: movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough
1, Very pleased!: As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors
1, 2/3 done: I am pretty happy with installment 2 out of the 3 that were promised. I have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars
1, It's great to have SGC Back: I hope we'll see more of this mini movies
1, Above expectation: The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
1, Video Review: Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews
0, Great movie butt o grainy on blueray: I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
0, one time cooker: This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
0, The few standout tracks on this album are...: 1) The intro
0, Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!: I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player
1, This cd is really cool..give him a break: I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild
1, Jusbeautiful: At first I didn't really care for this album
0, ultimately ineffective: This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn't talented enough to pull off what she's set out to do. Sad
1, Run Lola Run: This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so
1, What if!: This IS your bag:If you like action
1, My favorite movie ever: this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film
0, A bit overrated. . .: Actually this isn't really even a movie
1, Achtung!: This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over
1, Good for Hip and Knee joints in my Bichons: This product is palatable and seems to work well with my Bichon
1, RELLY CHALINGING.: RELLY QUICK action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern.batell is a chalinging game you fite. you can race to.
0, Just another excuse to make money: I am sorry but after reading this book
1, 10 stars!: This album is brilliant! If you buy it
0, Disappointing: This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice
1, Thank goodness for Amazon!: My cable was out
1, Joshua & Children: This is an easy reading
1, Nice CD
1, Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique: I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern
1, McDuffie's elegance and artistry are marvelous.: I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD
1, Great value
0, Not a horror movie
0, Absolute Crap!: Okay
0," A Truley Horrible Horror Film: A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum"
0, Too awful to be funny: I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad
0," Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!: Is ""The House On Haunted Hill"" so different than ""The Haunting""? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors"
1, Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick: If you like super-natural mysteries
0, ...and what a feeble haunting it is!: No
0, Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS
0, Poor plot: The actors in the movie are a great bunch
0, Catherine Zeta-Hipboots: A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation
0, Typical Hollywood pulp: Third grade mentality
0, EMBARASSINGLY BAD: This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!
0, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN
0, Sadly Disappointing: This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title
0, It may be a modern-day classic to some
0, Poor re-make of a good movie: I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie
1, A lot better than the factory seat.: The seat was a cinch to install. It took about 10 minutes tops
1, Great story: I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago. I was so happy to have it to download and read again on my Kindle!
1, Please the parents and the kids: Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart
0, too small for a newborn: I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
1, book review: Book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it. Great that it comes with a CD.
1, A great buy: This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!
1, helped a bit: studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab
1," A Surprising Find: The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an ""American music"" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review"
1, 5 for the 1st
1, Make sure you see Jean de Florette first: This is the second part of a two part series
0, Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam: I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC
0, Will Die
1, My favorite book of all-time: I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me
1, Simply Superb.: I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical
1, This Book Changed My Life: Before reading this book
1, Macondo
0, Too Boring to Continue: I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters
0, Columbian family values: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family
0, 500 pages of boredom: The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately
1, my #1 book: this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot
0, You must read this book!: This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
0, Emporer's new clothes.: I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation
1, U will never read anything like it: I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years
1, One of the best ever.....: I have read this book 4 times
1, A Haunting and Incredible Experience: I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish
0, lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book
0, Could never read this book....: This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English
1, Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece: This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration
1, great card: This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great
1, The best discworld novel; for beginners or veterans: I've read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)
1, Pratchett I just love him: the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories
0, I'll second that: I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs.
1, Carrot
0, Terrible product
1, Where are the other seasons?: This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date
0, Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable: I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books
0, Beware of editions by General Books LLC: Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material
0, Kindle version is very poorly edited: The content - introductory notes
0, Aaarrrggghhh: Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon
1, Cnnterbury Tales(Oxford Word's Classics): This translation allows you to read the stories
0, Great movie
0, Tedious and Self-Inflating: I'm always up for another look at the Titanic
1, This is GOLD!: Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order
1, Excellent fiddle: I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes
0, This Coyote Is No Genius: The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches
1," Good movie + these Coyotes aren't ugly!: This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the ""unrated version."" In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It's definitely a cutesy movie"
0, The bar scenes were cool
0," Coyote Stupid: This movie is so dumb... ""HOW DUMB IS IT?"" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb"
0," Absolutely horrible!: This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable"
1, Great Movie: I love this movie
1, Stunning: I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God's hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson's rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd
1, A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.: this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting
1, Rocks. Best. Get it.: Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also
1, GREAT: Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
1, the album grows on me...: I bought Garbage's first album first and I thought the album was great
1," Shirley...yum: Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track ""Temptation Waits"" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for"
1, Shirley & The Boys Do It Again: Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album
1, Great show: Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show
1, GREAT: AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW
1, absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie: Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.
1, Julia: If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching
1, Review of JULIA: DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...
0, Glich Heaven: I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell
1, Wonderful flow: What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer
0, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !: There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer
0," Another Bogus ""How to be a better surfer DVD."": This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga"
0, dont do it: If you know anything about yoga
0, no book key: I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA
0, Needs some modification: This thing is ok. But realize
1, Nigerians! An Industrious People: When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children
0, If you love the songs on Noddy
1, Nice Experience.: This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on
1, A rebuttal ...: ... to Jazzie of Hampstead
1," Native American Herbal Remedies: So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to ""flip through the book"" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer."
0, blleeuurrgghhhh: i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs
1, Dad is in Trouble: This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.
1, can't stand those male co-stars: I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!
0, bad acting: This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney
1, Switching Goals - a very good movie: Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie
0, Entertaining
0, Will bore you to death: Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
1, A good book: I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.
0, Not happy: I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
1, Nice suit.: It is a great suit
0, Worst test prep book I have ever used.: As other reviewers have suggested
0, preliminary review: I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book
1, Wild Wild West: This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
0, Isn't there a larger version of this game??: This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus
0, Disappointed: My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However
0, It's great when it works: I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well
1, the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert: yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert
1," Goodfun: Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or ""No! You go on without me ..."". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory"
0, Borinmg & dumb: A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world
1, Best film of the year: One of the best films ever made
1," See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!: ""Gods and Monsters"" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb"
1, best screenplays have more stability: One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay
0, Tree arrived bent and poorly packed: The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed
1, A Legendary story by Robert Creamer: Of the 200+ baseball books I've read
1, A Great Book on a Sports Legend: This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall
1, This will make your install a breeze. . .: My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
1, Great summer read: This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer
1, Gripping Novel About the Loss of a Child: The novel is a wrenching page-turner about a woman's loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live. The author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman's friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved. It is the best book I have read all year!
0, If I could rate it 0 stars
1, Helpful Start: Good book to start with; motivated me to get more books to read more about the nuances and subtleties about the game.
0, Sooo dissapointed: I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future
0, Material too flimsy: I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig
0, Disappointed: I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However
0, Looks & feels like a bootleg product.: My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby
1, Underappreciated Effort: While even some members of the Bonzos give this album low marks
1, Awesome!: I Love this. My kids have so much fun with these. They are strong and hold up to ruff play. They shoot water clear accross the pool.
0, A look at a distant past: I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems
1, Excellent Translation!: If you follow my reviews
1, One of Clftons great ones: I love all of Clifton Webb films
0, PURE JUNK: SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER
0, Poor example. The homework problems like hell: The examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems. Never explain how to do bode plot at all. I am glad I know how to do differential equations before taking the class
0," Misleading title: A book with a heavily religious slant. Anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that ""God has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires""."
0, Propaganda: As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health
1, Excellent information: This book was suggested to me by a counselor I was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction. We both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction. There is so much information in this book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
0, Great Concert - Bad DVD: I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
1, Great deal on a fine subwoofer: I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room
0, This Book is NOT for NXT: It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated
1, Practical Guide When Making This Challenging Decision: No one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there! This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere
1, Excelente: Tego es la fuerza en la musica latina. Es una tremenda mezcla de son
1, definitely the best horror\suspense book I know: Since you open the book you cannot close it
1, why?: This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening
1, chuck: This a good movie in the same vain as most of Chuck Norris's films
1, Memory Lane: I saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the 70's and I recommended it to my daughter. When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player)
1, Love these little smoker bisquettes.: I love the Bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses. It is so easy to use. We've used the mesquite and pork and chicken. It's all turned out great.
1, the best kept secret anti aging creams on the planet: Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.
0, Doesn't fit my situation.: My fault. I received it OK but it just doesn't work on my water heater. I must not have checked it enough. It was a bad impulse buy for me.
1, One of the Best Romances I have Read: This is the first book from Candice Porter I have read and I cannot wait to begin reading her other novels. From the minute I read the first page
1, Underrated album: I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others
1, lo mejor del cine español: esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone
0, Well made but extremely skewed: This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them
1," Well worth watching: The Space Race wasn't quite as one sided as one might believe. This series outlines the benefits of Capitalism over Communism but also shows serious flaws in NASA work to ""get man to the moon before this decade is out""."
0," Not one of Rinaldi's ""masterpiecies"""
0, This was not one of her best books
1," An Aquaintance With Darkness: This book was an absolute joy to read. It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring. This book is what I call a ""people-y"" book. She forms the characters so that they seem like real people"
1, Excellent!: This was the first book I had read by Ann Rinaldi and I loved it! I have read many other books by her since then. At first I thought I would not like this book because it takes place over 100 years ago
0," A story based on a song: As soon as I had read the first few sentences of the review I immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by Loreena McKennitt called ""The Highway Man"""

1, Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.: My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded
1, Do your homework: This product works great
0, Una porqueria no compre: Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse
1, Math made easy: This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
0, Average Book: The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
0, Some one has an EGO problem.: I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book. And I was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me

1, practical guide to modern christian living: in this book
1, Best Unknown Artist: What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation
0, Not as good as the other album!: I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However

1, Marlon Brando: A good
0," Horrible!: Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However"
1, Well made
0, Useless: The DVD will not play. It goes thru the process of downloading until the last point & then says that it is not programed for downloading. I would like to send it back for a DVD that will play.
1, Another great book in the series: I really love this book just as much as the two before it. I just don't want the series to end because I'm enjoying it so much.
1, The single creepiest film of the year !!!: At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated
0, VERY BAD MOVIE: This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk
0, Awful Waste of Money!: This tape should be sold as an audio only. The cave scenes are so dark
0, movie was a waste of money: this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it
0, trash
0, over rated: had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!

1," Creepy old Anthony Hopkins film: Magic stars Anthony Hopkins long before Silence of the Lambs. His character ""Corky"" is a magician who can't seem to catch a break. He decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success. His ventriloquist partner ""Fats"" starts to take over Corky's thoughts and motives. The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me. Just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing. Great movie!"
0," harassing bears?: Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer"
1, THE best book for AP spanish!: This book is the absolute best buy for AP Spanish Language preparation. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam (although I thought that they had a little more then what was needed). The practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test. Having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher

0, Great printer
0, 1020 printer stopped working after few months: I can't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months. I bought it last Dec
1, Excellent Entry Level Laser Printer: If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
1, Great Read - Suspenseful: When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down
1, classic: hardly ever see this movie on tv..so i had to order..love it a must see!! went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kid...never forgotten it!!
0, WHAT!!!: Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this
1, A classic!: Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious'

1, Mr. Coffee Warmer: The warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk. The warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off. I could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
0, Mr Coffee mug warmer: I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
0, Warm
1, Very nice product: I have been using this product for a few weeks. I have a ceramic tea pot that I use to make a few cups of tea at a time
0, Doesn't keep coffee warm: Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well
0, Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer: The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm
1, Good heat
1," Works pretty well for regular sized mugs: The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks ""city"" mugs"
1, Works Well Keeping Coffee Warm: This works well to keep your coffee warm longer. It doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee.
1, Awesome!!!!: I'm a huge tea drinker & I enjoy drinking coffee. But with my work
0, Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed: It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
0, Worthless Piece of Crap!: This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low. I made a cup of really nice organic Japanese Shade grown tea ($40 an ounce) and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for 10 minutes. The pad gets pretty hot
0, Not happy with this one!: I have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product. I tried pre-heating it and still no results. Very disappointed. I positively don't recommend this product.
0, Doesn't keep coffee hot: Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.
0, Disappointed: I am very disappointed in the Mr. coffee cup warmer. My coffee is really hot when I first put it on however on theMr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm. I can't stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion. Don't waste your money. Why can't they make a good coffee cup warmer? I am still looking
0, disappointment: I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more
0, What a rip off!: Three criticisms:1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.2. $3.00 for ten minutes!3. Cheesy coloration.
1, westmoreland glassware review: Great history of the company
0, DISAPPOINTING: This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points
0, Not what you think.........: If you read above
0, truly boring: This book was a waste of my time - I bought the bundle and now I'm not going to bother reading any more of Ms Cruise's ghastly stories. The dialogue was atrocious (and not at all amusing)
1, Highly Recommended...: This is an Awesome CD done by Derryl Perry
0, Holes drilled incorrectly: Aside from missing a few bolts I also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly. I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem. This is as far as I have gotten in the assembly as I have ran out of daylight. I am sure when it is finally together it will be a 3/5 bench as opposed to my current 2/5 rating. The shipping went well as It got here on time.
0, Stats Class Workbook: The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software
0, Too bad Galbraith isn't much of an economist.: Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers
0, smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number): Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
1, justice league done right finally: smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
1, Smallville Season 9 Rocks!!!: There are some folks who dislike season 9
1, smallville so far: i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc 2 many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood
0, smallville season 9: needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
1, mesmerizing marlene: If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film
1, Why in the world did they choose full screen ?: This is one of my favorite movies. I own the Lasedisc on widescreen. I could not wait for the DVD. I can't understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only. What a shame!
0, Pan and Scan? No thanks!: Rats. I was all ready to buy this movie
0, Blu ray wouldn't play: I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine
1, Love this movie: Great movie
1, Good DVD: this DVD is a good show. it is good to see DVDs still widely availible. DVD is able to have true stereo

1, good diaper: These are good diapers that don't leak
1, Great diapers: Pampers and Huggies are
0, THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS!!!: Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!
0, Leaks at the kid's belly: Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap)
1, best diapers ever!: Well!We never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers.We've tried all other brands (Cheaper & expensive ones) and nothing comes close to diapers.
1, Best Diapers Ever: From testing all kind of brands from every store possible Pampers Baby Dry is far most the best out there!
1, i loved this item: i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country 
1, Best for the price: Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler
1, Good price
0, Weren't So Great.: We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers
0, New and Improved with Sagging Technology: It takes a lot for me to dislike a product
0, Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers!: My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But
0, Horrible Diapers: I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also
1, Best for the Price: There are less expensive diapers out there
0, no: We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
0," ""Baby Dry"" but Covered with Poop: After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers"
0, Quality dropped in the last 6 months: I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency
0, Worst Ever!!: these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
0, There is a reason for cheaper price: Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter
1, The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!: These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
1, the best but only this time: pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
1, Swaddlers are better
1, Keeps baby dry and no diaper rash!: I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well
0, Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry: When my son wheres Pampers
1, Best fit for my baby: This product is wonderful !! and the best fit for our baby. We tried Swaddlers because of a friend's recommendation
0, Fall Apart: I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking
0, Leaky and expensive: These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.
1, best for the $$$: these do a very
0, Incomplete Shipment: The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
0," Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY: We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand"
1," Great diapers!: We have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer Pampers for our son. They fit him best and we very rarely have ""explosions."" This box is a great value."
0, horrible diapers ever: Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!
1, Maybe this will help...: A lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate -- the size of the 1-2s are the same as the 1s
1, These are great diapers!: I have been using Pampers Baby-Dry diapers since Zach was only a few weeks old. These are the only diapers I will use on him. They are soft and comfortable for him. I can't say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper
0, No Good: The diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything. We found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour. Interestingly
0, Baby Dry = Leaks!: We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers
0, Pampers Baby Dry - not recommended: I purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the Pampers Swaddlers. I was wrong. I just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not. My baby girl is 6 months and is an average baby...not chunky or big (other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper)Here are my con's:-do not absorb like I need them to. She is up one to two times per night and if I don't change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and I will have to wash everything.-they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers.- when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her..it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs.yuck.They really are fine during the day
1, Gr8 Product: My kid is enjoying 
0, Not dependable: We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift
1, Best value: I already have good luck with Pampers So far
1, Best Diapers: My little man sleeps 12-14 hours a night
0, Good: I like the price and quantity in the package but I'm noticing now that they are holding up overnight. I've recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
1, Good Diapers
0, Not as good as Cruisers: I normally buy Pampers Cruisers
1, Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack: I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
1, Best diapers for us: I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand
1, Best Diapers at a great price: I've looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers
0, Gave a rash: I bought the XL case of Pampers Baby dry in size 3 and after only 5 diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches.My son's skin is not sensitive and we have used Pampers swaddlers
0, Not my favorite: We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
0, Terrible Smell and Horrible Rash: We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now
1, Great deal..: when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
1, Gr8 product & Gr8 deal from Amazon: Wonderful product at a great deal from Amazon.Babies will luv them.ALL stars. I am in for repeat orders for the Pampers diapers.
1, awesome! I save a lot of money: It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
1, Good diaper: This is the best diaper I have found next to the old Pampers Cruisers. They are not as soft as I'd like and they don't have a liner like I'd want
0, Pampers: These pampers were the worst
1, great: Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
0, Not absorbant enough: I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.

1, Great for the price!: I love these diapers. i have been using it for my son during the day. with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price. i think 50% discount is very good. its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
0, Not what the name implies!: My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers

0, Rip Off: This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents
0, A Mistake: A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I
0, Shameful: In my opinion
0," Did I watch the same movie???: Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were ""ok"" in this"
0, .... HYBRID CD is a joke !!: ...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...

0, Does not adhere (peels off): So I tried this on a few things- attaching a leather strap to a suede bag I made
1, It Sticks!: The glue was easy to apply. My boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places ... Unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasn't one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay
1, Love this stuff: Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
1, Shoe Goo: Shoe Goo works great. The bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling. I applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry 24 hours. Next day the tennis shoe was good. Shoe Goo really works! For the size
1, Beginning with Audrey growing up during WWII brought integrity.: I learned a lot about Audrey Hepburn's childhood that I had never realized before. Beginning in WWII brought the story home and made it real.
1, What kind of person could have done this...: Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect
0, General Overview of Bizarre Cases
1, Fascinating Read: I don't typically read this kind of work
1, Why doesn't Clay get played anymore!!!: Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
1, My wife loves it: The stones are a bit small
0, POOR QUALITY: This is a very poor quality necklace. I needed to take it in direct light before I could see any stones
0, Really BAD: The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
0, SKIPPING CD'S: MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!

0, Not pleased: I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons. First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language
1, BibleMan a great Video: Absolutely wonderful video
0, There's a reason this was only on TV: The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand
1, excellent healthy eating book: Love the book
1, 11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack: The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
0, Received just one canvas: The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
1," Philip K. Dick would be proud!: This film is actually four short films... One film (The Robot Fixer) actually has little to do with technology or ""robotics"" as we usually perceive it (Lets play"
0, Defective Machine - Don't buy!: I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. At first
1, Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles: I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well
1, Supreme Coltrane: A wonderful and creative album. Great listening from start to finish. Belongs in every jazz library along with Blue Train
1, wow!: I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
1, Five stars?: There are not enough stars in the sky
1, Spirituality in sound supreme: A LOVE SUPREME was for John Coltrane
1, Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p: I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
0, Phone Cover: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was
1, Luck of the Irish: I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my wife who is Irish...she loves it....so do I and I'm not Irish.

0, Don't buy this book!: Only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser
0, Valeo WW2 2-lb wrist weights: I used the weights once. Well
0, Valeo wrist weights: The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
1, lite up: The bulb seems ok
0, I haven't received my items: It has been a month after the estimated date my items would have reached me and they haven't. Can you check on this???
1, Have fun with your baby!: I love this DVD! Get ready to have fun and interact with your baby. This DVD gives you so many ideas to have fun and interact with you baby by just using items you already have around your house. I loved the bright colors
0, Dissapointed: I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine
0, Buy a different guidebook: This guidebook is a waste of money - info is too scattered and does not address areas I will be visiting
0, Very disappointing: I liked the characters. He did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters. However the plot was awful. At the end I was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book. It's almost as though you're left wondering exactly what happened at the end.
0, Another spin on socializing costs/risks and privatizing profits: What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
1, brill: this album is a must have. look for the similarities between sunny day and jane's addiction in 100 million - i swear it's there. every track is incredible - be warned that listening to it in already-sad states will lead to probably more sadness

0, Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple...: Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia
0," Author needs to take grade school writing lessons: ""I didn't say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening"
1, Jane is a girl with spunk!: My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl
1," One of the most disturbing ""war movies"" ever made.: Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema."
1, Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry: Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!
0, Swimming against the tide
0, Ho-hum: Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song
1," Amazing soundtrack: This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. ""When She Loved Me"" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie"
0, spirit of christmas: i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
1," The Bible Made Easy: This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an ""easy read.""It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy"
0, Absurd Plot: The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure
1, A fine read: Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain
1, Better than The Templar Legacy or The Amber Room: Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content
1, Very entertaining: This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
0, A few minutes of horror: There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting
1, A hair to the right

1, Changed my life: there have been others books similar to this one
0, Stale
1, THE Ultimate Food for your Lories: This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
1, Do Fish Sleep: Full of very interesting info. which we probably never needed to know Bought for a 14 year old who really liked some of his previous books.
1, TiVo: Got this to have at my son's house when I visit. I love it! They love it too! Easily set up

0," If you liked getting scammed by Comcast's ""You don't have to do a thing when Digital arrives"" then you'll love the Series2: The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital"
0, TiVo TCD49080 Series2: This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths

0, Good to see that fans are keeping the place clean: It's sad
0," *Thumbs Down*: This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough"
0, Judge a Book by Results: I purchased this book over a year and a half ago
1, The GUIDE for serious players.: Difficult to win anything on your own. $$$ outlay by individual players is too large. Better start a pool at the office with co-workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems. You'll share winnings and losses (small and both sides unless you hit the Jackpot). No other book comes close. Get your rabbit's foot

0, Not for chevy s10 pickup: One bushing fits the other doesnt
0, Incorrect parts in package: I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
1, One of the Best Buffy Eps: Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos. It is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myself...all of the books are good too!

1, A good reference for basic techniques: I was looking for some more advanced features than were offered
0, Mixed Up: This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book
1, A True Romance - One of Garwood's Best: I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!
0, Killing your dog: In the chapter on Pets
1, Wonderful: This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view. Informative and emotional at the same time. Wonderful.

0, ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS: For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella
1, This highly surprising telling....: ...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
1, Well-written
1," Give Tey a try.: Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower ""done in?"" That is one of the great mysteries of history"
1, Mystery for history buffs (or a history for mystery buffs): Josephine Tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history. Was Richard III the evil murderer of the princes -- or not?I think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery (two of my favorite areas) and reread it regularly. So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery

1, Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea: This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation
1, Inside the Whalers: Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other
1, great historical account of good and bad leadership: a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the Essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that. The failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mate's influence to sail east in the small whaleboats
1, What a wonderful Story: What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad.
1, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.: The condition is somewhat less than perfect -- but not much.The book is wonderful. Fascinating story and Very well researched and written.
1, The sinking of the whale ship Essex: This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives
1, How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version?: I haven't read this book
1, An Exciting Tale of Survival: The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick

1, A sports world comedy sporting two wonderful stars: Hepburn and Tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent.

It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
1," Wireless is the way to go!: This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the ""setting up"" stage of connecting your adapter"
1, Works.: Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception
1, It works: This wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my Tivo. I had bought one at Radio Shack of a different brand and it did not work at all. But the TiVo Adapter was easy to plug in and set up. I have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now I don't need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modem/router.
1, Real Plug and Play: Plugged it in and my Series 2 DT popped up a config screen
1, It works: Not too much to say about this adapter. It does what it's supposed to. Sure an N adapter would be better but even the G is over priced.
1, Great product!: Easy to setup without having to read the manual (haha) and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems.
1, Works perfectly and a great price.: Short and sweet. Had it working flawlessly for 2 weeks now. No problems at all.
1, Great price and works perfect: I paid less and got the exact same Tivo wireless adapter as sold by Tivo. I have had no problems and now I get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables..
1, Tivo Wirelss G: Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time
1, Works with my Pioneer DVR-810H: I had purchased another wireless network adapter that wouldn't work for my DVR (approx. 4+ yrs old now). This TiVo adapter connected and works great. Saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through Amazon instead of TiVo directly...
0, Died 12/29/09 purchased 3/2007: I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot
1, Great product and easy to use!: We unpacked this small module
1, I like Hardy
1, I liked this book.: At first
0, Dubious creation: There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit
1, Hard questions....Real Answers: This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion
0, Snooz-a-pa-looza: Total waste of celluloid
0, horrible!!!: I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt
0, Worst.movie.ever.: Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen
0," What a waste!: Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched ""The Doors"" too many times. What a waste"
0, Dissapointed...: I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry
0, Difficult Read: This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled
0, An Insult to the English Language: I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class
0," Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.: The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7"
0, Great for Novices who want to stay that way: Elaine and Peter are career authors. They obviously don't use the products they write about
0, Expected more...: not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent
1, High Energy Performance: These women ROCK! This is a wonderful performance by 4 very talented string musicians. It is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing
1, Didn't quite live up to expectations
0, Useless for Home theatre or TV show.: This product is good for UK only. To play in USA you need to find a DVD player which has capability for changing Region Code to UK and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on DVD player in USA. I order it in USA
1, Wonderful Techniques!: I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children
1, Solid overall: Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach
1, Excellent Service: I order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase. It is excatly what I wanted and I got it in no time flat. I was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it..
1, Well made
0, used to be good: I have lots of these 
0, Wrong size: I have no idea how good or bad this item is. Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it. When it came it was S. and I didn't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size. When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has.
1," Works as Advertised: No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention. Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your ""area"" may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear. Once you remember to do that"
0, Dumping it down the drain: This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy
0, Original poem not used
0, This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.: Not one of the stronger entries in the series
0, maya: I loved the cover when I saw it
1, A Lesson in Human Tragedy: This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short
0, Of Mice and Men! More like Manly Mice!: I found several critical problems with this play
1, Read this book!!: I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
1, A Simple Story That Says So Much: Short
1, Lexi A.W.
1, Of mice and men - Izzy G: Of mice and men was a great book. It told about how and little man named
1, Great piece of american literature.: I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
1, Review for Of Mice and Men: Of Mice an Men is a great novel. It sends you back in time to the Great Depression era of the 1930's. It is a good book for middle school students. The reason I gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book. Except for the language
1, Astonishing! A Masterpiece! Bravo!: By far
1," ""of mice and men "" by: Ruben from Tx: ""Of Mice and Men""In this story there are two very good friends"
0," don't read this book: When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch ""I'm not saying he's bright"
1, Of Mice and Men: My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact
1, Of Mice And Men: The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment. I expected the book to be about mice. I later found out it was really about. This book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake. George is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation. So the book takes place in a rural area in California. I t is a fiction book. It's a rally good book so you should check it out.
1, OF Mice and Men: A classic
1, Wow: This book is short
1, awesome!: this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it's cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end........
0, dont read this book!: My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really
1, You must read this book!: Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George
1, Winning The Affiliate Game: Using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by. Thanks Declan for providing information that truly helps the average
0, Lukewarm at Best: I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan
0, Overrated: The funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it
1, Pretty good
0, save your money!: As an avid movie goer
1, Wonderful!! Watch it twice or you are missing out!: The first time I saw this movie in the theater
1," Another must-have-DVD from Sandler: I do love Adam Sandler and I thought him and Drew made a great pair in ""The Wedding Singer"" so I just had to watch this. I was not disappointed. It is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are well-written punch lines.Henry sees Lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him. Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.It turns out to be a charming"
0, Schizophrenic product: At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people
0, The First Fifty Sandler Movies...: ... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony
1, alot like life - funny & tragic: I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that
1, Fall in Love for the First Time Everyday!: The idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again. In this story it happens literally everyday.The performances:Adam Sandler as Henry Roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance.Drew Barrymore as Lucy Whitmore has never been better
0, perfume: This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
0," Stay Away From Passport - Large ""PIP"" Logo On Screen: Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large ""PIP"" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality"
1, Cookwear 4 qt. 3 piece: I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it
1, so did you read the DNA report?: it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place
1, I like it alot - from an non-latin: I first started listening to Azucar Moreno through a friend in New York a long time ago... This is exciting music
1," Topper is Tops!: ... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid"
0, No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!: I like baby dolls
1," Vanessa's Harmonium: A Work Of Art: Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking.""White House"""
1," Amazing CD!!!: This is by far a better CD than Vanessa's first. All I have to say is that this is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. ""Whos to Say"" has become one of my favorite songs. ""San Francisco"" is also an amazing song. Vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album."
1, Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton: Harmonium is such an incredible record
1, So much fun and versatile: My daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece
1, perfect: fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
0, BAD!! Don't buy IT: This item doesn't even look like the one the picture... It's not the real thing and it's a bootleg one..
1, A very informative book: I expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through. This book
1," Plenty of Emotion: I don't agree that Clay shows no emotion. One needs only to listen to ""The Way"""
1, Awesome: Listened to the CD three times and love it. Catchy tunes I caught myself humming throughout the day. Love ballads that I so moving. Great mix of songs. It sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today. A few tunes were almost Beatles sounding. Clean and refreshing!!! Clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it. Anyone who wants an enjoyble CD that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this CD. The CD just makes you feel good. Clay sounds great.
1, Hot! Hot! Hot!! This Man Is a Superstar In the Making!: I cannot describe the wonderful voice of this young man. Its so awesome
0," Why won't amazon post my review: I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
0, Yawn.....: Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough
0," schmalz: In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define ""schmalz"". Oh my god"
1, If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD: Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.
0, Talent without good songs.: It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However
0, california: I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good
1, He is the Measure of a man.: I love this man...and please don't get me started on his voice!I now can't ever imagine my life without having Clay Aiken in it! He's such a wonderful talent...not only with his beautiful
1, good but could be great: First
0, Measure of a Man's bad Material: Don't get me wrong
0, marketing machine-wolf wearing sheep skin: Ok people. I like POP music
0, Great voice
0, Great Singer
1, Changed my life: These recordings deeply affected me- even more so than the works of the Johnny Mathis.
1, 5 stars for the voice
1, CLAY FAN: CLAY AIKENS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECITED HIS VOICE LIFT'S MY SPIRIT'S UP I AM A DIE HEART ELVIS FAN JUST WATING FOR SOME ONE TO LIKE AS MUCH I THINK I HAVE FOUND HIM
1," I Love It.: When I first listened to ""The Way"" I loved it instantly. It's the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time. It is very catchy and very romantic. I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry"
0," I'm sorry: I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was ""cute"". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion"
0, Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony.....: Ugh! From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover
1, Measure Of A Man CD Is The Best: Don't listen to that negative
1, The Real American Idol: This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks. A must have for all American Idol fans
1, Superb!: Clay Aiken's debut... I wasn't sure what to think
1, CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI: THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
0," Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!: Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
1, YAY: I fell in love with Clay's voice when he sang Open Arms on American Idol. It was so touching
1, EXCELLENT!!!!!! 5 stars plus!!!!: Excellent voice
1, Well Done: I haven't liked much recent American pop
1, amazing!: Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing
0, nothing out of the ordinary: This man really does have a great voice
0, When a good voice meets bad music: This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators
1, Listen to it again!: Being a 31-year old male
0, It hurts: It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
1," Eventually Measures Up ...: While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American ""Can Do"" philosophy"
1, Fresh Sound: Clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode! I think this new release is great in every aspect. I too would like to see Neil Sedaka produce him! That aside
0, Not a five star rating: I am very surprised at the 5 starspeople are giving this CD. Pleasedon't waste your money. Clay wasokay on AI2 but this new CD justshowcase his talents. Hopefullynext one will be better. I will haveto give this one two thumbs down!
0, Disappointed but still a fan.: Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it
0, Really bad :(: That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
0, Doesn't Measure Up!: This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice
0, Nice guy and great voice: but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
0," Not What I Expected!!: I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
1, CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST: I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out
0," Why I Hate Potato Chips: Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos"
1, Decent Tunes.: I'm not really into pop music. I really like rap and R&B
1, Clay is da bomb: This CD showcases Clay's talent beautifully!!! He sounds fantastic. I think his music will appeal to a wide range of people. I am very PROUD of Clay Aiken. He has stayed true to himself. Thats refreshing. Way to go Clay!!!
1, Amazing: This is an AMAZING CD! This mans voice is incredable. There is not one song that I dislike. I loved his performances on American Idol
1, It Is All About The Voice!!!!!: Clay Aiken's voice stands out more than any other singer I have listened to. It inspires
1, Measure Of A Man: I love
1," skydivergirl: LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have listened to this CD since it came out on 10/14/03---CLAY AIKEN has a magical voice that pulls you in. All the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are ""The Way"""
1, CLAY YOU HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT...I LOVED YOUR ALBUM !!!: I am extremely proud of you
0, Doesn't do it.: I've honestly heard this entire album
0, Yawner: My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD
1, Clay Shines: I wasn't sure how I would react to this CD. It's not the usual style of music I listen to
1, Let the Revolution Begin...: After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single
1, One of the best albums ever!: Since the moment I heard Clay on American Idol 2 I have loved his voice. This album shows just what this youg man can do
1, Excellent CD with catchy songs: This CD is one of very few that I own that I listen to the entire CD. I enjoy each song on the album
1, Award winner and very deserving of it: No wonder this man won an American Music Award
0, Not Thrilled: I watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on American Idol
0, This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!: Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music
0, If I could have given this CD a zero...: I'm not a hard person to please
0, Not worth Buying: This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
1, Clay should have won AI: Clay Aiken is the reason I enjoyed the second season of AI so much. His voice is so pure and strong. It's almost like listening to an angel sing. It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings
0, This album is not as good as they make it seem: Only Claymates like it and his fans are buying his way. Mr. Aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great
1, What a cutie!: When I think of Clay
1," THE MUSIC IS BACK !!: People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the ""Measure of a Man"" CD. The crystal clearness"
1," Great album: This is an album that I will listen to again and again. Wonderful songs sung by a great voice. ""Touch"""
1, Awesome-Again!: Clay
0, Whats going on??: I dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it. I dont know i dont have his cd and I'm not going to get it you can if you want to but I like things that are original
1, Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY: This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert
1, Blown Away!: This is truly the best CD that I have bought in a very long time. I followed Clay Aiken all through AI2
1, Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up: Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD
0, Big disappointment!!!: Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while
0, AWESOME!!!: I fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on AI. He is not only adorable he as a AWESOME voice!! girls are crazy over him!! and this CD is SOO GREAT!!IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE CLAY SOO MUCH and if u say that you can't stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him??JELOUSY!!! : )Keep it up claymates! he has already gone double platinum!!! WOOWOO!
0, clay is such a joke: he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him
1, Love It!: I just love this cd. After I got the cd I must have played it over and over for days. There is not a song that isn't great! Everything is sung with such heart! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time. No gimmicks
1, The Best CD I Have Ever Heard: This CD sent chills down my spine. Clay Aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
0, Teen Titan Tower falls apart: This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star
0, OK Toy: I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter
1, Good stuff!: I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin
0, Not worth it: Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters
0, Car Parts (struts) for [] Java []...: This book is a complete waste of time. I had been very skeptical of the technology being only a short-cut for Java web hacks and script-kittys
0, non working battery: The watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead. I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch. I wont order from this vendow again.
1, Don`t listen to the review...: This album jams! Yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno-pop JAM!
0, Works fine
0, Special Waste of Time: This movie is for you if -(a.) you are over 20 and still read comic books(b.) believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman(c.) then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise(d.) find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves(e.) and don't know that
1, Hystericly Funny: Thought this film was very funny
1," Better than I thought: I would consider myself a ""radio"" Damn Yankees fan"
0," Do not be deceived!: This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared"
1, creative action all over: this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior. he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil. he uses that knowlage to kill monsters. The book is a little confusing at times
1, Chaka's Powerhouse Vocals!: When this Lp came out in 1982
0, Huxley it ain't...: I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors
0, Through the Madness!!!: First of all
1, works!: I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day
1," Even Creepier Than You Thought: What's most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison. Only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that ""these babies deserve to live."" Sadly"
1, BUEN PRODUCTO: Esta excelente el producto
0, Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman: If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary
1, Yancey has another one: I have read all Philip Yancey books & he gives an intellegent & amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the Bible. This provides a person the detailed readings therein
1, The Paradise War book: I was very pleased at how quickly I received my purchase. It was for a gift and I tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
0, Good show but TERRIBLE packaging: The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that
1, The Sanctuary: I like this show. But then again I like Sy-fi. Amanda Tapping is a good actress. Enjoyed her in StarGate SG1. And in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation..
0, Sanctuary Season 2.....Fail: After enjoying the first series of sanctuary I have recently purchased the second season
0, Temperature displayed is incorrect: The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. I returned the thermometer for an exchange from Amazon. The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it
1, Olives
1, If you loved the First Outbreak
0, Boring!!!!!: The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed
1, I did it so anyone can...: I am a grandmother with no woodworking experience. I made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners. I looked for help on the net and found this book. Three days later I finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect! The directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them. I have more trouble making a souffle than I had working with crown moulding - thanks to this book. It should be in everyone do-it-yourselfers library. By the way
1, Good Book - Presumably in Either Edition: My daughter (almost 3) enjoyed this book from the library last Halloween & we're looking forward to reading it again this Halloween. I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors
0, The Worst of Kirk Whalum: Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
0, worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all: I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors
0, Horrible product: This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market. The fabric is cheap
1, Shirt in picture is not what they send you: First off
1, Good buy with reservations: Of course the list price is a joke. However
0, Very thin
0, Poor Quality: I bought this shirt for one reason
0, smack the editors: As mentioned by other reviewers
0, A clas-sick that made me sick: This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
0, Interesting but Repetative: While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on
1, Oldie but a goodie: I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book.
0, A disappointing read for the 21st century: This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s
1, Twenty Thousand Leagues: A mysterious creature is haunting the seas
0, Internet connection turns off all the time: After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then
0, A REAL MESS: SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
1, Awesome!: I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover
0, Yadda
1, LOL!: Good stuff - some funny
1, Narnia: Prince Caspian: It was a great choice between BD and DVD
0, Thanks for the case: I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
0, Very Disappointing: If you enjoyed the book
1," OMG: OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL"
0, Too Precious: Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe
1," Correction on May 16th Review: The software mentioned on my May 16th review IS called ""AVID Xpress"" -- not ""AVID Express"" -- when my review was edited someone changed the spelling"
1, Easy to follow: This is a quick reference or trainer. Use it to help Scouts with their knot requirements. Simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot.
1, Knot idiots
1, Very Cool: I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
1, Have not needed it yet: This is pretty cool. It shows you how to tie some basic knots that can Come come in handy in various situations. I got this so I can leave it in my go bag with 100ft of some paracord.
1, The Wind in the Willows: A beautiful book with detailed
1, inspiring: a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did
1, The recipes sound great.: I look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information. However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe. This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup. The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count. Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.
0, One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.: Factually shaky at many points
0, Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!: The more you know about mountaineering
1, The bittersweet summit: A must read for anyone preparing to climb. You will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant
0, I was disappointed: I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish. As a redhead
0, Was she serious?: Since I have a red-headed daughter
0, It's okay.....: I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair
1, Excellent Series
1, Robin of Sherwood: Picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered. Also Disk 2 had a glitch in it on the first play. Disk is clean. Over all quality is not great.
0, Misrepresented Product: The image shown is EXACTLY what you'll get; it isn't misrepresented on Amazon. The package is mis-leading. It clearly shows a 2.2 mm Hex-nut. It does not work on any glasses that have a hex-nut. In fact
1, Every kind of comedy styling all in one film...: What makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has. You see not only slapstick and situation based comedy
1, One of the best readings about stats!: This book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics
1," Outstanding book: Someone once said ""there are three kinds of liars: liars"
1," An Entertaining Primer on the Validity of Statistics: Although ""How to Lie with Statistics"" is a bit dated (having been written in the 1950's)"
1, Clear
1, An Up To Date Primer!: This book is a very good primer for getting one's feet wet in the world of non-profit organizations. While it is by no means exhaustive
0, sony printer: not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz
0, A waste of money -- and tin.: This collection amounts to three dollar-store discs jammed into a pretty package. For those who prefer substance over style
0, Misleading: You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection
0, Not what I expected - a rip off: The price was attractive
0," Total rip off: The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says ""7DVDs over 11 hours"" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class"
1, Good Read: i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it. I enjoyed it but will not read it again.
1, Quite possibly the scariest novel ever constructed: Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print.
1, chico hamilton timely: cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
1, I hate reductionists: As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But
1, skillful: Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent
0, we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate: Pinsky is in love with being a poet
1, Great!: I like em a lot
1," Great Resource for Victorious Living: This is a great resource for victorious living! It shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty! It is a quick read - I was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down! I got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the ""dating"" stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as God intended. I highly recommend this book - whether you're married or single!!"
0, Fine Film
1, Very nice: Item was just as described. Very nice fit...does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect
1, terrifically written
1, Great: This eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo 2-3 months. Way more economical to buy here on Amazon than in the store. We reseal it for storage
0, choco tacos: I have to say I haven't actually read this book
0, As a How-To Book
0, Horribly Disappointed!: Don't get me wrong
0, the long secret--: just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only.
1, Good for Smaller bows: This product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows. I have a Mathews Reezen and it was too small. Amazon has a great return policy and traded for Plano Max XT.
1," Presents a way of devotion to Jesus and Mary: This book presents a marian version of the traditional Greek orthodox Jesus prayer. Instead of ""Lord Jesus Christ"
0, YUCK!: I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it
1, A very REAL book: Leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over
1, Summer of my german solider review: I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing. I thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today. The author didn't pull any punches in this startling work. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
0, BORING: I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW
0, A Boring with a German Soldier: Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot
1, Good: This was a present for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It arrived in a very reasonable time. It seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
1, Little America: This book was an interesting reading for me. It was one of the best school readings I have been assigned. It was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past. His style of writing was upfront and direct. We did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed
0, Disappointing: Fine as an introduction to Duncan
0, Bad quality zipper: We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids
0, what i thought about this tent: i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in 3 places. and the zippers are terrible always get caught.its roomy but its cheap!
1, Amazon shipping: This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.
1, Good Anime: If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it
0, I'd rather stick razors into my mouth: Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks
1, Best band of all time: This Dvd is amazing. Braid is rock at its finest. If you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour. The extras are hands down the best on any live dvd I have seen. This knocked the Impossibles Never Say Goodbye Dvd out of my player finally.
1, well written and complete but a little dated: this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative. nevertheless
0, Smells Sweaty: I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use
0, Unsupported by the Constitution: Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent
0, Not for Hydroponic Growers: This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing
0, Evident Growing Errors!: Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower
1, Great find!!!!: This book was a great find! It has more information than pictures which is okay
0, still waiting: This book never shipped. ordered over 6 weeks ago. Smazon still says ships within 1-3 weeks. it has been 4 weeks past their estimated ship date. So don't bother ordering this book.
0, boring & pretentious crap!: This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead
0, Heavy going: It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator
1, DVD Version please!: I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it. I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.
1, Very fun video and not hard to follow!: This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
1, Fabulous: For the first time
0, I like Elton but...: I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
0, crocodile crock: The king of Crocodile Rock lost his teeth 25 years ago but here he is -again! - plugging away in geezer FM heaven. While old pharts may love the way John's campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their Depends
0, not what i had hoped: i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie
1, Best Yoga video for kids of ALL ages & abilities: Totally fun and captivating with creativty for children 3-13 plus lots of stuff for older brothers/sisters as well as Mon/Dad or any extended family member to partake in. Great pace for ALL. Perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow mood.Everyone will be inspired to increase their mental/emotional calmness
0, Very slow shipping: The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
1, A Great Book: Once I started reading this book
1, The Greatest Generation: Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
0, Great topic
0, A great disapointment: Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead
0, Mr.Brokaw concentrated too much on officers: Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview
1, Greatest Generation: A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets
1," Inspiring: I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the ""greatest"" or not"
0, A waste of time: Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation
0, Good idea
0, A book of simple hurra patriotism: I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me
0," 0.5 g of Trans Fat per serving: I bought some because it was advertised as ""A healthy snack choice..."" only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil."
0, VTech i6775 Review: Years ago
0," No. Just No.: looks cool. Key word people ""looks"" cool"
0, Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK: This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
0, this is not the latest version of the book!: I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously
0, the paper back edition is a pirated
0, Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ): The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old
0, NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!: Hello Champions
1, Body Movin': When you hear the term rap-rock these days
1, Humorous bathroom material: This is a great bathroom reader. I find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off
1, True Love: This is a very good CD. There is no song on this CD that I don't like
1, A significant book in psychology and the Bible: Johnson
1, big improvment: My Dell 2650 has 256mb of ram total. More then one program running and it would slow down sometimes freeze. I took out the two 128mb sticks and purchased two of these
0, Sounds not like yoga instructor... Really I apologise for my feedback.: The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal
0, not that good: all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
1, I loved the theme song
0," Boring Waste of Time!: I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of ""Emotion"
0, Fake blue Lights: These lights are not blue.I can't even tell that I've changed mine from stock bulbs.There is absolutely no difference here.They don't deserve one star.Absolutely do not buy these..It's a waste of time and money.CON
0, Do not waste your money.....: I'm a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning. In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money. Yes
1, 60 minutes of encouragement and fun!: Our whole family loved this video. It is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family (both young and old alike)
1, A MUST SEE!!! QUITE HILARIOUS!!!!: I purchased this video for my son (who loves them) and fell in love with it. It is my favorite Veggie Tale to date. A must see!! It is quite hilarious especially the silly song with Larry.
0, NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE! 1 1/2 STARS!: I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person
0, This is a horrible
0, Died after 2 years: I read those positive reviews here and bought this item 2 years ago. It worked pretty well at the beginning. Starting from about a year ago
0, too slow!: We bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it
0, Quality of cooked rice went down after about 1.5 years: For the price
0, Broke in 10 months.: I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
0, Just after 2.5 years
1, THE little appliance that will.....: All I can say is that every working
1, We love it!: I purchased this rice cooker as a Christmas gift for my parents. I was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My parents loved it - my mom has Alzheimer's so my dad does all the cooking. He has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals. Once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well. The cooker is very easy to clean! We are very happy with it. Ours is made in Japan
1, Best white fluffy rice I have ever had!: The rice turned out perfect! Very different from other rice cookers I have tried. I am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the LCD display though since I don't intend to plug the machine in all time.
1," great item: I was a little confused by reading reviews but I decided on the goFit ball at 65cm and it worked out just right for my 5'8"" frame. There was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided.Did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my 215 lbs of body weight.I would recommend this item."
1, Like it: As other reviews
0, Way too soft: It is possible I got a defective ball
1, Change the picture please!!!!!!!: I read the reviews prior to ordering
0, Not been able to inflate it fully yet: We have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet. The go fit customer service is open only monday - friday 9 - 5.So we haven't used it yet. I think i should have just bought it from a local store. The instructions are quite poor.
1, Great purchase: A coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. Great value
1, Big
1, Having fun with the ball: My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well
1, comprehensive book: This book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems. Very rich in detail. I found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
0, Huh???: This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
0, Effortless and Misleading: When I bought this box set
1, What is this gorgeous chaos ?: Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
1, thoroughly enjoyable
1, A great guide in simple terms!: A great
1," more than ""disco"": In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd"
1, Childhood favorite: This was an important book to me when I was a little girl growing up in Colorado. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end
1, Delightful: I loved this book as a young girl. I loved the message about finding your talents and making the most of them
0," ""You Get What You Pay For""!: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated)"
1, Oscar de la Renta Eau De Toilette 8.0 Oz.: My wife thinks this product is identical to the product we found in local stores
0, Hate it: We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes
0, Serious flaw with this bike rack. Screws made of PLASTIC!: At first glance this rack seems well designed. In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure. However
0, Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors: The Quality is tenth rate
0, Good show. Bad release.: Air is a pretty decent show
1, Heller with a gun: This novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers. A excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
0, Best Keep As A Secret: This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast)
1," Start here: These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of ""the stereolab sound"".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy"
0, Not what I Thought: I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong
1, tactful approach to adolescent obesity: This movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully. Could be shown in high school health classes.
0, Below Par: I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director
1, Another great Feinstein golf book: Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books
0, A Good Open Spoiled: The subtitle should be
1, Deadliest Plane Crash reveiew: DVD was in excellent condition
1," One of the Best Texts in ""Calculus Reform"": If you read it through and through"
0, Nearly useless as a calculus textbook: I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition
0, I wouldn't recommend this book....too much dam sex!: I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye
0, Drunk SpongeBob?? A Disappointing movie.: NOTE FOR PARENTS: What was Nickolodeon thinking?? SpongeBob and Patrick stuff themselves with sundaes then behave like drunks...down to the staggering about
0, 100% CR**!: What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie
1, Great movie: I loved this movie. It's about Sponge Bob and Patrick going to Shell City to get King Neptune's crown. ANd while SB and P are going to Shell City Plankton takes over the world. IT's a great movie. See it.
0, Worst Movie in years!!: This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy
0," ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever""!!!!: I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy"
1, Great case: I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.

1," Nebula Awards are synonymous with great SF: ""Nebula Awards Showcase 2006"" is another collection of stories that you read and don't forget immediately. Another great-deal-treasure through Amazon."
0," Disappointing: This book was suggested reading as if "" THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM"" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view."
1, Happy with the product: I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
1, Palm case: I love this case. It is very hard to keep my palm protected. I carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work. Befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm. This case prevents any damage. I LOVE IT!
1, Good
0, Legal Mumbo Jumbo: This is truthfully worthless books. I had counted at least 20 typos on this book. I also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not. It is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book. The litigation only contains New York

0, Pretty and very BORING!: WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell
0," why do you pay someone to write your reviews?: I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other ""reviews"" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written."
1, Enjoyable and Instructive: I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners)

0, NaST like a teST: I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
0, Only one part was good in this whole book: This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield
0, OK: This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However
0, Boring: After purchasing this for our home library
0, Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones: I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse
1, Love this book: I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
1, The Witch of Blackbird Pond: The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book. It is about the early American settlers
0, An interesting but predictible book: This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts
0, A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield: This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters
1, A Joy to Read: This book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read. Kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of Barbados in the late 1600's and live with a strict Puritan community in Connecticut. She has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh. One of her special relationships is with an elderly Quaker woman

0, this album suxxxx: i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
0, Not all that: I am a Oasis fan and to be honest Be Here Now isn't very good . The only good songs are d'you know what i mean 
0, not terrible

1, A terrific follow-up to their last album.: I loved Oasis' first US album
0," Another example of cocaine-fuelled excess: ""Be Here Now"" does have its moments (""D'You Know What I Mean"""
0, Boring...: The songs in this album are quite boring
1," This one amazing album!!!: I like Oasis because their songs are rhythmic and I like the lead singer's voice. All of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good. There are 12 songs on this album. I like the 4th song "" STAND BY ME "" because it's really nice when they say ` stand by me"
1, Thank god we have Oasis!: These album is their best work yet
1, Top one!! Mad for it: Why do Yankees always put Oasis down eh? They are the Greatest band ever. I live in the same City as they did and I'm listening to their music 24/7 People just get jealous of their success. If anyone agrees or disagrees e-mail me instantly!!!!

1, Billy Joel My Life single: When I purchased this cd I did not know what to expect. I have been a Billy Joel fan for my whole life. I was very surprised during the first listen. Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound. I hope there is more to come. Joseph Leonardi
1, Great book: Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
1, Fun Read!: This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd
1," The Gadget is it ""Too Good"": The Gadget by Paul Zindel is about a thirteen year old Stephen Orr. His Father is a scientist that works for the Goverment in the time period of the 1940's. If you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect. Stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him. Matt Hadsell. They both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded. As my title says ""Too Good"" thats exactly what this book is"

1, nice Pitcher: Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
1, excellent: perfect for frothing. well built product. would buyanother in a heartbeat.no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously.
1, Works well
1, Frothing Pitcher: Given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker.They used it for their guests same day (!) and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher. It's a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
1, The Fall of Reach: This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem
1, These books Rock!: Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game

1, It was pretty good: I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However
1, If you run you have to give it a try: I read ChiRunning in Sep 09. It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running. I've been ChiRunning since.It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints. I now run 4x a week
0, Not worth the time: I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old

1, Great Headphones: I use these for blocking out noise at the office

0, Excellent Audio
1, Only one problem with the backgammon set: I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks
0, hmmm...: Would I recommend it? Yes
1, I think you should read this.: I think it was a very good book
1, I own this - so should you...: I'm a professional chef and a big fan of German knives. I like a heavier knife in my hand that I know will do the job all day long that I want it to. This set is amazing and I use it every day. Granted; I have swapped out a few of the garnish instruments for what I prefer to use (hate the zester and the peeler). Turned heads when I first brought it out at work but everyone wants to borrow my knives now due to their superior quality and sharpness. I wanted something other than a tired out knife roll that everyone has and have not regretted a single second of owning this item.

1, Batman Scores A Win: Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson
1, Best Batman Series!!! Great Beginning!: Best Batman Series!!! This is a great start to a fantastic story line! This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!! A must see film and must see series!
0," Review Style comment: If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine"
1, Batman Begins Blu-ray: Muy buena adquisición
1, A New Batman: I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back. I wanted the new take on the character. The movie doesn't disappoint. It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
0, no batmobile!!!!: -1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
1, The Best Batman: As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter)
1, title for my review.: I rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for DARK KNIGHT RISES!!! This movie was awesome
1, may be a bit overrated: I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit
1," Cool movie but NOT ""THE BEST EVER"": I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones"
1, batman begins: batman begins is the best movie of 2005!christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it!this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels.so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan
1, Very Good: Very entertaining. Good quality Blu-Ray for the theatrical version. HAve not yet explored the special features.
0, I'm not sure why this movie got good reviews: I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful
1," Best Batman movie until Dark Knight came out.: Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a ""superhero"" movie fan"
0, It's below average.: It contains a lot of action. However
1, a good batman in long time: i saw this movie this past summer it
0, This movie was never that good.
1, Batman Begins: It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
1, It has been said before but bears repeating
0, Would Not Recommend this Toy: My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it
0, Sounds like a good idea
0, Could be better: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now
0, Disappointing: Firstly
1, Crystal clear production and interesting arrangements.: I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically
1, Athletic Director: GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!
1, Weighted walking vest: I really like this product..i've been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for jogging...and i have seen results already...it's funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost 10 lbs...the only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really can't wear it under clothes
1, GoFit 10 lb walking vest: This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing
1, GoFit walking vest: This vest was just as described and the fit was great. It has wide shoulders so the comfort is good. Since I had never used a walking vest
1, Pretty: These are very pretty but I did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red. In a few years as I add more colors to my tree I will have them.
1, Hard To Heat: I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time. I use them in my massage practice as hot packs. The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile. The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it. I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it. UGH it is a pain. Haven't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly. Otherwise I love it.
1, Great product.: I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro
1, great save for my Mac from my toddler !: This little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family! I feel safe leaving my 3 year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on. Really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore. It would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely
1," Chirstian ""Death"" Metal: Yes my friends of this great indstry"
1, Excellent Value: Got these to put in my camper

0, trash: This cd blows nothing worth listening to. Really sucks the big unit. One of there worst cds.thank you very muchyour welcome
0, Unhappy....Constantly Turns Off: Very disappointed with this amp. It has an auto shut off
1, Simple Amp: This amp does what it is supposed to do. Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the AB speaker switches don't allow output to go to both speakers at the same time. Maybe this was in the write up but if so I missed it.
0, Too noisy: An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
1, Just what I was looking for....: Great AMP for the speakers in my garage and Lanai.....Sounds great and easy to useSimple is good...plus the price is right!
1, Works very well: I have a whole-house sound entertainment system
0, Horrible Audio
0, Not good unless you have a good knowledge of math: I'm not a math cripple but I will admit that I have not always been that great when it comes to math. I have recently grown a hunger for science in general

1, Great Shorts for work or play: I have bought about 6 pairs of this short. They are very confortable and wear very well. I'm pretty hard on them because I wear them for work. The hold up very well
1, A compelling Biblical story: This Biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of King Hezekiah. The characters have depth and I am eager to read the next book in the series.
1, Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings # was a great introduction to the series. I gained a different insight into the History
0, God's and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1: This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!
1, History in action: I love history - especially Biblical history and this book uses the information in the Bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive. It seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon.
1, It send be back to the Word: Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great.
0, Did Nothing: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
0, did nothing: I got the tea fast

1, The Train Delivers!: Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold

1, The best heart and key pendant set ever!!!!!!!: Absolutely one of the most beautiful little necklaces around. Get it and you will get lots of compliments on how nice it is. I was so happy that I purchased it.I had been looking for over three years for the perfect heart and key set
0, Impossible to read: The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
1, Superb seller and wonderful product: Date: 11/28/2008 (I bought this for Christmas 2008)My brother-in-law had wanted a Clint Eastwood Poncho for a long time but the ones I saw were pretty expensive. Then I saw this one on Amazon. Not only was the price right

1, Not So Scary Anymore: I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say
0, Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc: I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
0, Missing most of the play!: This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV
0, duplicate dvd: This is the same dvd that I had previously purchased with a different cover. I will keep it because I like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
1, Different: This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs
0, Do not buy: I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed
0, Boring Book: I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes
1, Not too powerful
0, Ew!: Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs
0, not enough calories: This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories
1, Too Bad they broke up: These guys really are great. Too bad they broke up before they could really big. they're big but i mean REALLY big. I'm planning on buying this album once i'm not broke. I've litened to thier free mp3s on mp3.com and they are really good. I look forward to the purchasing of this album.
1, A great book for everyone: I didn't think anger was a real problem for me until I got married and some things I thought to be essential needs weren't being met by my spouse. This book has shown me some powerful principles on how to understand and deal with my anger constructively rather than destructively.
0, this is a christian based religious agenda book: It's a trick ! unless you have a religious outlook don't buy this book ! Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense.
0, not a christian and can't use it in my work.: this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
1, Ahhhhhhhh!: This back brush is what I have been looking for for a long time. others I have tried were too soft or were of sponge material that deteriorated quickly or fell off the handle. This one is a good
0, Big Minus: This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
0, Bloody Awful: I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
0," Typical rightwing garbage: The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the ""Just say no"" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well"
1, Preparing for adolescence: It was so true! And definitely helpful. Teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through.
1, Rational Anti-mysticism: Healthy debunking: Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view

1, Ionic Breeze Review: I bought this product for the girlfriend
1, Funny and smart: These guys are really a good match together. So funny and fun to watch with the family. I wish it had the Thin man
1," I know I'm biased but..........: This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the ""Thin Man"" seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age.As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping inWal-Mart i'm that easily pleased"
0, Run
0, depressing and scary: I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome
0, Disappointing romance: Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance. Couple doesn't get together until the end of the book. Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history.
1, Ideal Weight: After having numerous store-bought scales
1," Dennis back on form: Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the ""old band"" while retaining a fresh"

1, A colorful and vivid album
1, Wonderful Collection: I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd
1, Wires and Wood: Saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great. This is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
1, good stuff: As a huge fan of Buffy-only the original novels
0, what a waste: My poor son was so eager to play with this toy after receiving it for his birthday. But he was quickly disappointed. The tank was too heavy when filled with water and the straps would not adjust enough to fit on him (we had to rig the straps). The tube would come out of the tank when i tried to pump the tank. Which I had to pump repeatedly. Was not a toy that he could play with on his own
0, I don't think nephew ever played with it.: I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
0, Really needs an AC adapter: See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V

1, Sixteen-and active: Keir Gilchrist
1, Sweet story: Great story of a teenager who spends a week in a mental health ward makes new friends and changes his life.
0, ugly lighting
0, Slow Paced and Dragging: Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
0, IZ: Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
0, Disappointing: I give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my Bose. I returned them once
1, Loud fast
1, Excellent sauce whisk: I love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean. I highly reccomend getting one for yourself.
1, R. Kelly is still on top!: R. Kelly is still on top! TP-2.com consists of 19 blazin tracks
1, freak come out at night: r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one
0, Once again R kelly has done it.......but did we want him to.: R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is
1, best r&b album of the year: I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.
1, great understanding to helping yourself: this will help you to under stand life and your own self needs and how to listen to your inter soul if you follow your owen heart. it has helped me to see thing a little different.
1, Amazing!: Love this book
1, Phenomenal Reading Material! Lots of Fun: I'm naturally a huge fan of Jeff Corwin and his work to help nature and its inhabitants is very much needed these days. He does a wonderful job in putting you in the locale that he is in. Vivid descriptions and his natural mix of humor makes this an excellent book for any reading enthusiast. Great photos included. Definetely worth adding to your collection. You'll have lots of fun reading it!
1, Interesting and fun read!: Jeff Corwin is an amazing man who has many adventures to share. His love for animals shines in every word he writes.
1, Great Children's Story: The Precious Moments Stories are great.We like to keep them in our home to share with childrenthat come to visit ~ we enjoy watching them over and over again as well.

There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.

1, One of the greatest plays in English Literature: I have read this play and also performed the part of Joan on stage many times. Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English

1, If you read only 1 book about the death penalty

0, Poor product from dishonest dealer: Ordered two
0, unseen is the word: I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious
0, Definitely not Prodigy's best material: Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason
1," Great tune!: The Prodigy are back!""Baby's Got A Temper"" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless"
1," One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!: The first song I heard on this album was ""Bounce"
1, Good but doesn't top the first one: As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort
1, COOL: Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song
1, Overall pretty good: I'm going to make this short and sweet: it's not the greatest album in the world because I still can't listen to the whole thing straight through
0, [bad deal]: Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
0, I may have enjoyed this album
1, Real good music.: This CD is really 
1, One of Systems Best Albums: Along with their self titled album
1, Awesome!!: This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
0, Bunch of Garbage: There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
1, shock to the system: Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity
1, Buy this cd!: This is a great cd.I have listened to this cd probably 20 times and it never gets old.All the songs are good.
0," Complete Liberal Garbage!!: This music is sooo old and tired. These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones...""Lets all Riot"
0, Um......: Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot

1, Amazing book for future study in Tort Law: I would recommend this book to law students in both pre-law and law school. Well written and covers important cases.
0, global puzzle: poor Adam Crall
1, Cool puzzle
0, I'll Pass on this next time.: Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
1, New Developments for the middle of a series: I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
1, Another top-notch film about Victoria by Victoria: Victoria Hamilton seems to pop up everywhere
1, Pure Pop for Moog People: Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day. The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music. The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for: Catchy
1, Satisfying your supernatural cravings: If you like battles against ultimate evil
0, Lamebrain to the hill.: Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here
0, Overblown Mess: This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring
0, Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?: Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz
0, Weak
0," Should have read the reviews before I saw it.: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book ""Hellblazer"" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves"
1, Finally I can pre-order the DVD!: I haven't been able to get this movie out of my head. I love it
1, creepy cool: Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic
0, Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?: This movie is garbage
1, Yay: Some wear and tear on the case
1, Good Movie!: this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now
0, What the HELL were they thinking?: Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly
0, AWFUL.....................: My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
0, Dumb and pretty bad.: What do you get when you have an actor who can't act
0, Pure stupidly: Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz
0, Pretty bad: Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script
0, Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves
0, Not even a B movie a Z minus movie: Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind
0, Comment on CONSTANTINE: I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said
0, This was the worse.: Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over
0, Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster.: Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz
1, Additional Info: Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
1, good strong tires: I brought this tires for a friend in 26 x 1.75 she hasn't had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them....
0, Be careful: I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads
1, PRAISE THE LORD: I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY USEFUL Being a practicing Christan and not being into WICCA or Witchcraft I have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now. I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship. Boy was I dead wrong. The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought. I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around. I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here)
0, WASTE WASTE WASTE: All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
1, Good for price: Yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly
0, Inedible: I made this gum with my 8 and 4 year old daughters. I ended up making 99.9% of the recipe myself. The gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy. The food coloring (red and blue) stain everything and is impossible to get off of your hands...you HAVE to use you hands to knead the gum. The worst part is that even after all of that
0, Delivery time too slow: From the time of order to receipt
1, The Black Crowes are incredible!!: One of the last great southern rock bands is back
1, Man of Many Trades: This book taught: That we can master more than one trade
1, At first he seems just an ordinary kid...but wow what a life: This is a marvelous book and an easy read. Even though Ben Franklin seemed to be just an average guy
1, Good insight to Ben Franklin: I had heard many different things about Ben Franklin
1, I wish I had read this earlier: This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men
0, ben franklin: dont believe we received this book ...could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book
0, boring: I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me. So that is why it is one star.
0, Not for the Southern Hemisphere.: Quite a well thought out book to take around with you.BUT... limited use to me as there are no Southern Hemisphere maps or details (even the Southern Cross is absent).Would not have purchased it had I realised. At least it was cheap!
0, johny heeering
0, Kindle version: You cannot search terms.. every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over 40 pages.This is not worth almost 10dollars for kindle version. Your better off with print. The kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
0, Almost too bad for MST3K...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever! You have to turn the car off or the EM pulse will fry it? Pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when it's off
1, Really works!: 1 star because it is messy but this is AMAZING. I've used the freeze away crap and it doesn't work and is too expensive. This is cheap and will work within two uses. Make sure you wrap the area tight though!
1, Success At Last!: Like many others
0, disappointment: After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work. I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working. I tried using this several times and it did nothing. I don't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it. Too me
0, Doesn't work good
0, terrible product: Bought this to remove a wart. Weeks later of apply several times a day...minimal results.I threw it away. What a joke. I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50% and boom...the wart was gone.More expensive
0, Not worth it.: I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor
1, So far I am impressed!: Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So
1, Great Item: I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
0, looks like chap stick: I got the wart stick for my grand daughter (11 yrs old) she has a wart on her hand and foot! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i don't know if it works or not.
0, With Love by Hilary Duff: This product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it.Don't like the scent anymore however
0, NOT AS MY EXPECTATION AT ALL!: I thought it's a score book
1, Building up steam...: Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful
1, Great classic
0, Looked cool :(: I am an avid ps2 gamer. I purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience. Was I ever wrong. The device has a battery indicator on it with 4 bars. When the batteries go down to 3 bars
0, BALLS EVERYWHERE!: We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
1, not just for the over 3 crowd: Santa bought this for my then 11 month old for his first Christmas. He and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells. (The cats do too.) I don't think you need to wait for age 3 as recommended. I do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already. I highly recommend this product
1, Great Product!!: I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys
0, Flimsy and Seams Coming Apart: I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly)
0, You call this a mystery?: I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer
0, Disappointed!: Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose
1, Great for 18 month old and 4 year old!: My girls love this. It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well. I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead. The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.
1, Lost Balls....Found?: Nice book
1, Great toy but Hard to turn off: A review from a kid.: pro's :great fun
0, Not like the ones I've seen--not as good: Instead of being a better product
1, My kids & all their friends love this game!: My 7 & 9 year olds love this game - and we have gotten it for all of their friend's birthdays
1, It's Grrrrreat!: My wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends. It's fun to think of an object (20Q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things) and answer it's astute questions and it usually gets it right. Sometimes it has to go on to 25 questions though. Kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device. Highly recommended.
1, Classic
0, ...: The music on this set is fine
0, Nice instight hidden in the pages: The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes)
0, Too much money for too few channels: This antenna may work for some people
1, Best Book on VB.NET I've Found: This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET. It is well written
0, Obfuscation of even the most trivial slices of code: Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money.
1, Great cookbook: I purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in Trinidad. He was not able to buy a cookbook while there.I searched Amazon and bought the one and only Trindad cookbook
1, One of the best books of all time: This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images
1, touching: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn 
1, An Awsome book that you must read!: Francie is a girl who is dirt poor
1, Three Thumbs Up!: I give this book three thumbs up! It is poinent
1," Fantastic reading: I have read "" A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult"
1, It's not hype!: This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written
0, A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however
1, Saw the: movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read.
0, A Classic?: I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
1, A Lifetime Favorite: My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
1, Great book
0, Credit Cards Will Not Fit: All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
1, It's both gorgeous and a good read: This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months
0, Dissappointing at Best: The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly
1, A Story Everyone Must Know...: Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley
1, Well Worth Acquiring!: Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers
1," ""Conversation"" video: I bought this video for the ""Conversation"" video where Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams Jr. are playing their guitars"
0, Not What I Expected: I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However
0," How did Brian Mcknight and Russell Crowe get on this CD: I couldnt wait to hear this CD cause i love Kris Kristofferson and his work. many of the names on the CD were great and some great singers came out to do triButes to Kristofferson. Shooter Jenning's ""Silver Tongue Devil and I"" is amazing. Willie Nelson's ""The Legend"" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on ""Why Me"" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's ""Darby's Castle"" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity ""Me and Bobby Magee"" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of ""Me and Bobby Magee"" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged."
1, Hooray for Doris!: These two albums have been (thankfully) put on one CD. Doris is at her best here

1, Excelent: This is the second time I bought the same book from Stamatis.The first one I gave to one friend. He push me do give it as a gift.This second edition is far better.
0, every since i saw one on tv: every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
1, Good System: I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area
0, Voice alert system 6: I am sorry that I ever bought this thing
1, Great Puzzle: Although it took a long time to receive this puzzle
0, Too much sex!: Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep
1, First prize.: This book has found a permanent spot in my home
0, Do Not Buy: This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
0," a total rip if you own ""Music has the right to children"": If you already own ""Music has the right to children"" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with ""Music.."" becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones"
0, Violence Bonjour?: How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book? Having rather enjoyed Deja Dead (the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month)
1, Watch Out for Those Bones: Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner
0, Dull
0, Awful!: This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious
0," What is your definition of good?: Readable and missing no pages? Wow! I was in the book business a long time and this paperback I received was not in ""good condition:"" it was dog-eared"
1, Good
1, Holy Grail Found!: I've been after the vinyl for these two albums for 10+ years....it is considered the holy grail of west coast (USA) psychedelia. I gave up and bought the CDs through Amazon. Better than I thought. An absolute classic and equal to the reputation. Years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation. Everyone I have played it to are equally high in praise.
1, Too much is not enough: My boys
1, A good collection: I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense
1, Dreaming of more...: Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet
1, Vivid descriptions and fast moving plot: Although it has been some time since I read this story
0, TERRIBLE!!: I have never entered a review before
1, THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!: This book is ultra-rare
0, Too much: This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact
1, asimov is a genius.: Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book
0, Another one...: ...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me
1, one of the greatest TPB's of all time: If you like comic book deities even a slight bit
1, Great story
1, This deserves to be an Animated Movie.: I had already read this story before I got the compilation version. Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view
1, A Collector's Review: An Awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe.
0, a patchwork
0, Worst in the series thus far.: By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development
0, Disappointing After the Really Great Work in 1632 and 1633: I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633
0, Not so much: I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.
0, I agree...just recieved today: This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back
1, Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring: I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville
1, I love this simple band: I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny.
1, Decent: After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger
1, Back to the Movies: This product was handled and packaged fast
0, Worthless: This stuff is a ripoff. I found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything. It does not. Go to the store and buy a 24oz bottle of cheap body wash and a 2oz vial of tea tree oil. Empty 2oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in. Shake well. Same thing only MUCH stronger and a fraction of the cost.
0, Dangerous!: Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat
0, Disappointed: I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
1, starblazers goood: i just picked up the dvd of the first 5 episodes and must say that the vhs version {by jupiter} was much smoother and cleaner than this {dvd} version. however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on 25 years now. so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up.AND SEND IN YOUR CARDS.
0, America is Going Deaf: I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music
0, The worst band ever: I've seen this band 2 times and believe me both times I wish they wernt on the bill. They are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you. Seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway.
1, it DEFINATELY grows on you: at first listen
1, Beyond Excellent: I seldom *ever* find a book in my school library that is worth reading. This book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more. I'm hoping the door is open for a sequel
0, The Transall Saga: The Transall SagaBy George MickcloudMark is a normal teenager who lives to be out in the wilderness. Mark goes on a solo camping trip through the desert when finds a strange blue light that when he touched it. It transported him to another planet and time. Now he must us every nature skill he ever learned to survive. Two years past and is now a strong dark colored man. One day he fined s a village under attack by an evil ruler he joins the fight and saves the king of the village and is made second in command for his bravery he is now part of this village and is starting to think that he wants to give up looking for the blue light a stay with his new family. But some people don't like Mark and want him to leave. Mark now has a price on his head for his death. Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying. Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family?
1, A Book I Actually Wanted To Read: This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!
1, A Great Book: I was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final. I am not a big reader so I was upset about haveing to read. The day after I got the book I got sick and had to stay home from school. To pass the time I sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours. This book was exciting and although it was slow at first
1, James Lee Burke-Dave Robichaeux series: This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series
0, Not worth the price: I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.

1," brings out the romantic in me: These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department"
1, My new FAVORITE FACE WASH!: The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light
1, Great Whodunnit!: A classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing. Watch for a spell-binding cameo by Stephen Herbster
0, Sloppy research: Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations
1, love it... she's wonderful...: Ít's one of the best books I've ever read. Was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever... She's a very strong women and I like the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way
1, Love these diapers - they don't leak!: Okay
0, WHY DO WRITERS DO THIS??: This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin. He writes way too much about each individual film the actor's made up to the time of the book's publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them!UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
1, This book is wild
1, Buy this book...if you love nature.: Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert
1, Sums up my innermost feelings: I can't rave about this book enough
1, Nice: For what it is (an inexpensive tp holder)
0, Bring the old type back: At least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants
0, I have three of these things--none of which work.: I am an old lady who doesn't throw anything away
0, Lazy reproduction of an old book.: Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system
1, An Elric novel written by Authors who grew up reading Elric: I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy
1, fantastic pix of TEXAS: Beautiful pictures... excellent photographs If you want ton see Texas this book is it......

0, Im with Jim: The pedals fell off
0, Boring: The problem with this book
1, The most beautifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns: This is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns ever published. Every page is a visual & mystical treasure.I reccomend it to any & all seekers of light on the subject of Unicorns.

0, Disappointing: This is a fascinating subject
1, Very nice set especially for the money: Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
1, Clear and tremendously helpful!: I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources
0, What a stinker: How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted
0, Dude whens it over: This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
1, I wish i could give it 100 stars.. because i'm cool: what a hot film. so intelligent
0, Dude

0, It is dumb: I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything
1, Dude!!! Sweet!!!: This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.' But along the way things don't go as planed. It's a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Sean Scott. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!
0," ehhhhh: I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing ""next track"" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good"
0, Trinity: This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed
1," Newspapers are still a rag: ""Infamous Scribblers"" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up"
1, Very Fun Racing Game: Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.
1, Autumn
0, Not First Printing: I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line
0," The worst book I have ever finished!!: I can't believe people really enjoyed this book. It was tedious and dull. Nothing new happened once the stage was set. Of all the ""zombie"" reanimated-body books and movies"
0," I am now avoiding Moen faucets!: We had a Moen kitchen faucet with a ""lifetime warranty."" It is junk. It started dripping after 5 years"
1, If things were perfect
1, A MASTERPIECE of Electronic Music: This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten. I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now
1, Excellent: Moby's latest album touches on many genres of music
1, Great CD!: Very good CD
1, Moby Continues His Great Style: The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music
0, Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic!: Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold
1, An album for Christians and non-Christians alike.: You can dance
1, he gets it right: Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop
0, moby = genius ¿? why ¿?: People are saying that moby is like a god
0, There is NO way this CD is one of the best of the 1999: I purchased this CD because everyone is raving about it. I mean I ever heard about it on a night time sitcom...but whatever the case
1, Results IN: Moby pulls off the album of the year.: I am not even done listening to every track yet
1, let's play: This was my first Moby CD and I brought it for my fiance's birthday. We both love it! We have brought the CD Wait for me and Last Night since then. Moby knocks the socks off of Lady G

1, A very good cd: This is a very good cd you should buy it! My favourite songs are Why does my heart feel so bad
1, remix: I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com.
1, MOBY'S TITLE SIMPLY SAYS IT....PLAY: A really good CD....I wouldn't classify it techno
0, Never received it!: I'm sure if I had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent
1, Loooooooooooove this book!: I read this book over 13 years ago
0, The loudest stealth ever: Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth. Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud. Apparently they've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers.FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one. Buy it amazon or B&M; or better yet
0," I'm glad I'm not the only one....: This phone was fantastic for about 8 months. I could go about 100 yards from my house while talking without any interference. However in the last month the handset started ""Channel Searching"" no matter how close I was to the base and how good the signal. Two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since. I have done everything I can think of including change the battery and it continues to search and while it searches the answering machine doesn't seem to work. Oh well"

1, Satirical and funny...: I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester)
0, Trying...: The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile
1, Office Space Blu Ray Review: I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet
1," perfect christmus gift for manager or co worker: We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words ""WORK SUCKS"" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch."
1, I Believe You Have My Stapler....: Ok
1, love this movie: I bought this for a friend who had never seen it. I was going to let them borrow mine
1, milton is the MAN: aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy. from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie. i have never even been inside a cubicle (thank god) and i think this movie may have influenced that. milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and HAS NO RED STAPLER??? *GASP* but anyway...anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line. this is a new CLASSIC in my book.
0, Office Space: I ordered the movie Office Space

1, Cult Classic!: If you have ever worked in an office environment
1," Simply the best...: Yeah... I'm going to have to ""go ahead"" and rent this movie again because I missed most of it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line.Seriously though"
1, Life imitates Dilbert: If you've ever worked in a cubicle farm
0, hate it: this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
1," This is the only movie I have watch over 5 times!: I love this whole movie! I is my all time favorite. I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it.""Corprate Account Payable"
1, A Great Flick!: A must-see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment
0, Get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy!!!: ... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas)
0, Busted DVD: I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen)

1, Office Space (1999): This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam
1, Laughing at Ourselves: There are a lot of funny movies out there
1, So real it hurt: The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know
1, NOT just another space shooter: When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man
1, Works great
0, Mother Night: Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
0, A bit disappointing.: It's vintage Vonnegut
1, Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better: Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize
0, What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!: This was recommended to be a wonderful movie
1, the choices we have to make will always haunt us: a brilliant character study of an upper middle class jewish german family who escape to kenya in the days before world war 2. having to adjust to a different world
1, Great Movie!!!: A very compelling story about a boy and his colt
1, You Can Analyze Handwritting: Here at last is a book that simply and lucidly teaches you the extraordinary science fo Graphology. With clear
1, Good book
0, Hardly the Oregon Trail: This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead
0, Not a happy customer: This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product
1, A Truly Loud Phone: I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother who wears two hearing aids. Not only can she finally hear me on the phone
0, Ho-Hum........: With all the great material in the WEA vaults
0, Exploitation of sibling...: This book was terrible
0, Uninspiring Cd: The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire. Listening to these songs had to be one time only deal.
1, This is Great!!!: I bought this for my husband to be for Christmas. He grew up with the F Troop and wanted this. He loves it. I am very happy with my purchase. Great entertainment and it is CHILD SAFE comedy.
0, It's A Bust: Warning
0, Good book bad Digitization: The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page
0, Dull: I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book
1, Attention to Detail: The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism
1, Very Good: Pretty good. Like the DC version
1, Spans the Generations of Marvel Characters: A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties
1, this book is a marvel: MY SON IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WITH THIS BOOK ON CHRISTMAS
0, could have had more surfing: When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing
1, Review by: Christine Stevens: It has the episode Angel on it w/David Boreanaz...what eles do you want
1, nice set of songs: THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS
1, What I expected: These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set
0, Terrible Headphones: I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash
0, Another verbal window into the past: Once again
0, Disappointed: I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side
1, Inspiring: I listened to this book on cd which I have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person. I loved C.S Lewis's Mere Christianity. It gives a educated view into why he believes in God and more specifically the Christian God. He is a great writer and the book is very intellegent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0, Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding: I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately
0, Merely the same things rehashed: I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded
0, disappointing and childish: I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith
0, Quality works in poor quality packaging: For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last
1, The best explanation of the core of Christianity I have read. Fascinating.: It has been a while since I last got excited about a book
0, Book: The book took a while to get here
1, One More Review!: Hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years. And no wonder! It's author did not become a Christian til in his 40's when he came
1, Seeing the Truth in the Logic: For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking
1, Great book: Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
0, Why all the hype? A huge letdown.: In all fairness
0, Not very enlightening: As someone who has a genuine phobia of flying I thought that this book might provide some useful insights. After about a hundred pages I realized that it was just a lot of lurid filth. It is a total con. I ended up throwing it off the train somewhere in the middle of Manitoba. Probably the biggest rip since the Neverending Story.
0, A disappointing book.: The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit
0, Too thin: I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough
0, Why do people like this?: The costumes and sets aren't too bad
1, Magnifique: Eurasia's most inspired duo.Flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future.Not for the faint of heart.
0, FUTUREDOC: I have been through most of the test preperation books in the market
0, Solid math review but lacks application for the SAT: Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also
0, Below average CD
0, a story hidden in words: Way too many names
0, Aimless and self-absorbed: This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
0, Could Have Been A Fun Movie For The Kids: With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor
0, Not worthy of One Star. If the Academy gave out Oscars for: Worst movie
1, Worth the price of admission: I dont know how anyone could not laugh at this movie. It seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor. I wasnt a fan of Ben Stiller until this move. He is very funny in it. Despite the focus on humor
1, Not Bad: This movie was really silly
1, Good read for CA students wanting to learn about their histo: I'm trying to locate the abridged version that I taught from in the 60s. It's out of print and I would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not-so-good readers now.If you find any please call me at 949-854-8889.
0," rating the physical book...not the story: This book is an excellent story. Lots of California history..or better..Alta California as it was known in the era.BEWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BOOK !!!!! It is about 10""x11""...printing of the story is VERY!!!! pale.I will keep this....but have ordered an older"
0, Had to return it.: After I install this blower fan it made a loud ticking sound. So I thought maybe it was hitting something. I uninstalled in and ran the fan uninstalled. It still made the loud ticking noise. So I had to return it. The bad part was that Amazon deducted 7.20 from the price I paid for the fan because I did super saver shipping. I don't recommend buying this fan or any auto parts from Amazon.com since they don't stand behind defective products.
1, Awsome!: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First
1, 10 Stars! By far our favorite toy!: This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer
0," WTF ???: Video only?Absolutely no sound from this ""NTSC"" DVD.I tried it on multiple machines and several computers...No dice...the soundtrack is absent.You have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show.Not very satisfying...I'd rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band.just a bit pissed in Puyallup"
1," Looking Back with Love: A tantalizing performance by Kathleen Turner. Anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great "" what if"" In this film Peggy Sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back ..there!Turner pulls it all off in grand style. The realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are. Nevertheless "
1, It is like going back in time!: I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother
1, cutting edge: Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman
1, funny girl: This is a very good movie. It is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again
0, Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education: This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes
1, Nice Book: Clean
0, Had to buy it: I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
0," lazy publisher: The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback"
0, jude the mundane: thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail.
0, Not an easy read: I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer
0, OK products
1, The Origin of Betty Boop!: Helen Kane is the flapper who was the model for Betty Boop. When you listen to this CD
1, works good: Works great now I get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast I give the company and the steamer 5 star
1, Combo Saucepot and Steamer: Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family
0, Be careful it's hot
1, Great Steamer: Got this mainly for veggies. Works great and fast. Very pleased with it. It could be a little bigger but can hold 4-5 servings.
1," Excellent book!: To tell the truth I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my ""joy"" was not something to which I was willing to admit.John Piper doesn't disappoint. His books are deep which is exactly what I needed as there are just too many superficial books on various Christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one's heart. John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you. If you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you. Awesome book! If it is what you need then you will NOT be disappointed!"
1, great great great: I WAS LOOKING FOR INEXSPENSIVE HDMI CORDS FOR MY PS3 AND MY NEW HD TV.. WELL EVERYONE TOLD ME U HAVE TO GET MONSTER CABLES THERE LIKE 50$$$ BLAH BLAH BLAH...!!!! WELL I FOUND THESE AND THOUGHT HEY THERE CHEAP SO IF THEY DONT WORK OH WELL.. BOY I WAS WRONG THEY ARE GREAT..

I EVEN GOT THEM EARLIER THAN EXSPECTED.( I KNOW I WAS CHECKING MY MAIL BOX DAILY) .I WILL DEFINATLY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!
0, Very poor quality for HDMI: After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360
1, Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.: The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type
1, HDMI Cable: This HDMI Cable category 2 hasn't fail me at all. It works great
1, Great price--don't buy branded cables: If you can tell the difference between the images and sounds these cables transmit and those transmitted by more expensive cables
0, Adult who enjoys Good Children's videos: This was very amateurish. Don't think it would hold even the attnetion of a child
0," The Last Unicorn VHS: Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you"
0, Can't Manage to think about it...: The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie
0, The Last Unicorn: If I could give this a half star I would. I bought this for my children to watch and I felt with a rated G rating that I was safe. How wrong I was. I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did. When the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all I see is the tree and her huge breasts. And the magician is stuck between her cleavage. The world is getting sick enough that I don't need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it. I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie. I think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children.
0, I like Unicorns
0, Great movie
0, Fantastic Movie
1, Fantasy or reality: I have always loved this movie and was so excited to learn it was on DVD finally. A wonderful cast and wonderful music. I could watch it again and again. I love it.
1, A Truly Beautiful Film!: When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster
0, Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen: First things first: This is a nice movie for kids
1, Untitled: I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
1, Good movie: This is a great movie! I first saw it when I was about 6 and I still love it! Beware of the profanity! I recently saw it again and I was surprised to hear the bad language because of the G rating.
1, AN ALL TIME CLASSIC: People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
1, Next best thing to being in a Chicago blues club: Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites. My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died. Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs.
0, Yet another version
1, Awesome drum for a crappy drummer.: This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box
1, One glaring omission
1, A book for the ages: I mistakenly checked this book out of the library when I was in 4th grade (1964)
0, No Joy Here: The site of an immaculately turned out Susan Hampshire in thick eyeliner and gleaming white (flared) trouser suit prancing through the Serengeti should serve as an immediate red flag. This is about as far as you can get from Bill Travers' and Virginia McKenna's charming performances in Born Free
0, Disappointing!: This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship
1," Mini Shuttle Astronaut: I love this item! It occupies the top shelf of my ""sci-fi shrine"" next to my tiny Star Trek models."
1, Born Free!: This film is great for family! I watched online through Amazon Prime and it played perfect and was so crystal clear! I recommend this movie for all families!This movie will make you laugh and cry it is that Great! I will order this DVD through Amazon.com soon and add it to my library! This movie is also educational for everyone!I Just Love all Cats
1, BORN FREE: THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE
1, THE FAMILY UNDER THE BRIDGE: THIS BOOK HAD GREAT CHARACTERS AND PLOT. IT TOOK PLACE IN PARIS
0, Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids: This book
1, The Family Under the Bridge: This book
1, Mitford Years ammended: Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.
0, Disappointed: I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books
1, Perfect: Thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition. The book was great and I really love the whole series.
1, Absolutely the BEST: I have worn NARS Sunset Strip lip gloss for over 8 years and still continue to get compliments on the color. I have tried all the other major brands
1, Better than expected: My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far
0, The shadows between: The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man
1, Wonderful book!: I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.
1, Streisand at her comic best: This was Barbra Streisand's first non singing role
0, Warning - misleading listing: This item is advertised as being the R-rated (original) version. It is not! It is the reissued (and censored) GP-13 version which is not nearly as good or as funny.The listing should be corrected and we can only hope that one day the studio will release the DVD in its original version.
1, Anamorphic Widescreen: This imported DVD has a nice picture. It comes in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. The audio is in Dolby Digital Mono and has Korean
0, Okay!: I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
0, misrepresented usefulness: Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles
1, The Slipper and the Rose: Finally
0, Caution with this supplier: this product is ok however
0, All show
1, Correction of author: author is Arloc Sherman: As can be found on eric.ed.gov and cbpp.org
1, A kitchen staple: I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage
1," great movie: I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun."
1, I believe he is right: Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.
1," remarkable!!!: I love this cd. My favorite song is ""Gills and Tails."" I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory. True talent. She is soooooooooooo under rated. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL!!!!"
0, A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.: As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy
1, Gods walk among us: This is the 2nd Dirk Gently novel and like the first it is good fun 
0, Boring: I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I did'nt buy it) and was really disapointed. The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal. Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time
0, you have got to be kidding me: I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
0, Sucked: I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money. It simply sucked.
0, Poor quality product: After 2nd or 3rd usage
1, Amazing bargain for the quality: I love this cookware! I had to leave my old kitchen things behind when I moved suddenly last fall due to illness and had gotten some cheap crud at Wal-Mart. BIG MISTAKE. After just 5 months it was a mess
1, Great!: I really love this pot. It's a bit larger than I expected
1, For the price
1, Perfection!: I love these guys! Finally
0, Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions: It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest
1, Excellent!: This book is very well written and researched. It is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about.
1, Wow.: Even if you know a lot of this stuff
0, Super-awful: It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that
0, poor quality: I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However
1, I've got the ice in me.: Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally
0, How not to write a book!: This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel
0, Eye opening: It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it
0," Rule#1: Just because it's published doesn't mean it's true.: This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to ""describe"" Catholicism. It is of note only for its ludicrous claims"
0, A codex of garbage: This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church. The truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the Bible in order to support Boettner's rancid work.The book is useful for Catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against Catholicism.As a source of honest information
0, Outrageous pack of lies: As a former protestant turned Catholic
0, No understanding of the Catholic Church: The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
0, May God have mercy on you
0, A Good Fantasy: Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page
0, Good idea that fails in implementation: I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time
1, UK TO THE FULLEST: SWAY IS AMAZING
1, A wonderful story: Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life
0, Not good enough: I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good
0," Made me feel icky: I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of ""the rest"".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling"
1, A good buy for Sedaris fans
1," Something more serious: If you enjoyed ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books"
1, Rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter: Being the first David Sedaris book I've ever picked up
0, A literary reality show?: Sedaris' book is entirely too self-aggrandizing to rate as entertainment. Spare yourself from the temptation to buy.Lamar Nesbit
0, Random rantings from a drugged homosexual: The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that
1, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim: Hearfelt essays on David Sedaris' life growing up gay in middle America. Always full of astute observations of American life
0, good pan
1, Farberware classic 10 inch frying pan: I've used Farberware for 40 years and have always loved their products. Most of my pots still look great after so much use. They cook food beautifully. The only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use. They can usually be tightened with a screwdriver
1, Fantastic: I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!!Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses 2 pound) by igourmet.com
0, It didn't help my vision: I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work
1, Terrific Album but what happened to 4 Strong Winds?: I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.
0, Great music
0, Prairie Wind review: The CD does not play. I have tried it in several different CD players and it simply doesn't play. The Johnny Cash CD I purchased with it plays just fine
0, Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted: I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2
0, Lost in stereotypes: A decent book that could have been great
0, If you like reading for the sake of reading...: Ultimately
0, Misguided Purchase: The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
0, Not as shown: This product is shown in its picture setup with a top. There is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with. What you get is a white folded cloth in a bag.
0, No plot: The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
0, B movie: The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting
0, Ewwwww...: What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
1, Excellent (no spoilers): Only this and 'Sherlock Holmes' were grabbing my interest on the new Video On Demand releases. I was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick. I'm so glad I picked 'Triangle'. I haven't been this freaked out by a movie in a long time. There's truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end. Superb directing
1, stealth movie: a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
0, Don't waste your time: The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie
0, Poorly researched
0, very poor quality: I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality
1, trashy
1, Couldn't put it down!: I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school
1, The Other Boleyn Girl: This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down
0, Tawdry: For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns
1, Scandle
0, Not worth the time: First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century
1, Makes you want to keep reading on: A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look.
1, Easy reading: Book is very different than the movie
1, LOVED THIS BOOK: I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on
1, History Brought to Life: This book
0, I Already Knew the story: I have to admit
0," Historical Fiction Overdone!: With an emphasis on the ""fiction"" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well"
0, Finally finished it: I liked how it started
0, A novel for the intellectually challenged: Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will
0," ""Other Boleyn Girl"" a future Lifetime movie for certain: The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence"
1, One of the best books I have ever read!: This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family
1, Very enjoyable...: Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era
1," A ""can't put down"" book!: It's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's beautifully written. Gregory finds a great balance of description"
1, A Fast Read: I breezed through this book and I found it a great read. I had a hard time with some of the stuff
1, When Movies were More Fun: I had recorded this movie originally off of TV years ago. It is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories. What I really appreciated with this DVD is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
1, 13 Ghosts Review: I saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake. Then I found out that Martin Milner was in it and I knew I had to see it. This was your typical old black and white movie. With the typical dialogue that you would think. But I thought this movie was really funny
0, Disappointed....: I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
0, good idea
1, A very pretty decoration for all
1, Flawless: Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow
1, Clear and concise
1, Not just for breast feeding moms :-): Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms
1, PHOTOGRAPHERS HELPER: I don't have children yet
1, AWESOME PRODUCT: I LOVE THIS! I AM A FIRST TIME MOM WHO BREAST FEEDS MY BABY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE SUCH A LIFE SAVER! MY SON IS 9 MONTHS NOW AND WE STILL USE IT ALMOST EVERY FEEDING. IT SAVES YOUR ARM AND NECK FROM FEELING STRAINED AND HOLDS THE BABY AT JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR NURSING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY MOTHER.
0, Don't really get it...not useful for us at all!: I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up
0, recalled boppy: I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first.
0, Wait to buy: I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews
1, A great product!: We got this to support our arms while bottle feeding (though it seems to be known for breastfeeding-it is helpful to us bottle feeders as well.) The unique shape is great because it can be turned to be comfortable for different sized people and different height chairs. Also
1, Great for taking pretty photos: This Boppy was very helpful in feeding my daughter during the early weeks of life. It also helped with laying her down when she was in the phase of waking up everytime you put her down. I would nurse her and then transfer her to the bed on the pillow
1, Roses are reds
1, This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute
0, Definitely a disappointment!: I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
0, SORDID BOOK!: While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature
0, how can you like this?: this book had good morals but it was so confusing
1, Golding at his Greatest: Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot
1," Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the ""The Lord of the Flies"" was to show that without laws"
1," all in all a good book: Well written but definately not my ""cup of tea"". High reccomendations for those who enjoy this type of literature."
1," A must read: The noval ""Lord of the flies"" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done"
0, Weird: I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls
0, Not the Best novel: Well I have read this in 7th grade. I really don't think of it as a great novel. I have read better. It depends on what your taste in novels are I suppose. I know that this isn't a good review on this novel and I am sorry if this misleads you. Well
1, You sure you want to read this?: This book is not for a rainy day. Rainy day's are depressing and exploring the dark side of the human soul is no less. If you are into dreams leave this book on the shelf. If you want to feel like puking from the pit of stomach at the depts of human depravity this is the book for you.One sentence to describe this book:A daring expose of the cruelty of children and a slap on the wrist of anybody who thinks kids don't need discipline.
0, Most Disappointed: Well
0, An unbelievable waste of time.: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel
0, Thumbs down: God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book
0, It's a good book
1, The Lord of the Flies is a great book.: The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school
0, Great book
0, It is worse than reading the dictionary: It was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i
0, Yow! Lots of people wrote stuff
0, Disgusted: I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone
1, Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel
0, Boring: I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part
0, I don't like the book: I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
1, A brilliant achievement. Symbolism beyond comparison.: This is my favorite book yet (and by the way
1, great classic book: this book came on time and was in good condition. It has been on my list of books to read for a very long time
1, A fairly simple story with deep meaning: LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism
0, No wonder they call it the Lord of the Flies this book stunk: My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids
0, a conventional view of mankind: this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance
0, Took too long: It's great ordering a book
0, May be a classic...but not as good as people think: I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade)
0, Lord of the Flies was creative
1, A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.
1, Shocking: I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males
0, Novel review of the Lord of the Flies: The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out
1, Nice Book: I think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read . The message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times
1, Adventouros story
1, Thought-provoking
1, Everyone Should Read this Novel: This is one of those novels that everyone should read. Through isolation on a remotes island
1, the what ol' days?: I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader
0, A girlie book with lots of blood: Friends who know I`m interested in war history recommended this book. But this is not war history. This is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details. If you are looking for the real stuff
0, Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful: This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking
0, They cut the extras: I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray
0, Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan
0, very dull and witless: This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
0, Not for kids under 12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great
1, Compact Phono: Portable And Plays 78 RPMs: This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
1, A great
1, THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
0, Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all
1, Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late: If you have a child that is late with speech development
1, How to go to College Almost for Free: I bought this for my grandson
1, Cool Book: I'm not much for writing book reviews
1, How To Go To College For Almost Free: This book is very informative. Ben Kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner. This is a great book for parents and students alike.
0, The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level
1," THE great American literary genius of the 20th Century.: Let's see now ... have you bought in to the ""PowerPoint"
1, Orson Welles and Magic: I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies
1, Used It For Years: We've used this product for many years. It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly. They shine better than they did when new.
0, Poor Service from Home and Beyond: I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week
0, Vapid and vacuous: The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
0, Dumber & Dumber: Yeah
1, Parker's new charge...: Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex
1, Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing
1, Awesome series.: The autumn series its just amazing
0, GSM Phones: Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery
1, excellent reading: this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible. this man was very knowledgeable about his subject. he was also very familiar with his subject [jesus] as you will see when you read this book. no christian should be without this book in his library.
1," typos galore!: I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the ""misspelled"" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author"
0, Overrated: This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
0, Very slow: Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume
1, Fresh and exciting!: When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen
1, Great for the beginner
1, Great product!: I took a chance ordering this product
1, A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends
1, Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological
0, Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen: The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book
0, Not good: I tried to read it
0," bad video: James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after ""JFK"" came out in late 1991---everything good"
0, Good packaging - no mushrooms :(: While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go
1, satisfying middle book of a fantasy/romance trilogy: Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School
0, beware: First of all
0, Sometimes less is more!: I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere
1, The Blob- Fear has no shape: This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much
0," A family saga that disappoints: I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick ""Stone From the River"" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga"
1, Excellent even for those without formal musical training: Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training
1, Another rocking Weeds Season.: Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
1, Great series: A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
0," Kate Mulgrew before Voyager: ""A Time for Miracles"" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected"
1, Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive
0, How To Write a Movie in 21 Days: I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However
1, This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books
1, Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien
1, Out of the ashes: The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question
1, A Great Summary of Labor Law: I am an ESL teacher with a background in law. A Colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws. This book was an excellent introduction to labor law. Anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book.TCB
0, Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First
0," Superficial: I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like ""Kill your television"""
1, Good video
0, Did not fit BCM carry handle: Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
1, CCS Yellow Cutting Pad: Used with a Porter Cable buffer/vibrator
1, WORTH IT!!!!: Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company
0, Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit: My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or
1, Entertaining to the last page: Trollope is addictive
0, Printer won't work now...: I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge. Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly. My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge
1, good: I enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal . The cost is very economical. I will buy again.
0," I was not pleased: I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word ""COPY"" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original."
0, Trite
1, All That Matters: I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
0, Item Not Available: This item was out of stock
1, Twilight Zone fans will love it: I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection
1, Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming
0, I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason
0, It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie
1, Inspiring and Soul-Searching!: Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it
1, Through the Narrow Gate: Older book with new foreword. Personal discription of life in convent by well-known religious author.
0, too goofy and cheesy....: Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books
0, Eggs stuck immediately: I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it
1, Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily
1, A daughter of the Mennonites: Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
0, Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read
1, (Based on a) True Story: Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
0, a great disappointment: The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
0," Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler"
0, You've got to be kidding!: Why would they release such a complete mess like SciFi Wasabi as a single?...completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest. Musically and lyrically a disaster. I'd rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive.
1," Better Than the First: But not as revolutionary as the first album ""Viva La Woman."" I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica"
1, Excellent Movies: I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters
0, Rust problems: This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
1, A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been
0, Raises good questions
1, ellery queen mysteriesa: This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
1, A very nice shoe: I bought this more for fashion than function
1, Great running shoe but why is price way up?: The double-edged sword of rating a product highly: you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price. I bought this exact shoe 1-1/2 yrs ago for $45 w/free Super-Saver shipping. Now the shoe costs $73 + shipping? Maybe we should all keep our mouths shut. And what's w/the different pricing for different sizing? Sounds like discrimination to me. Could be a federal offense.I've given it 5 stars to see how much higher the price rises.
1, A classic: It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
1, So sweet!: Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
0, Forced previews: The movie is fine
1," A perfect film: ""Babe"" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there"
0, Not Good At All: This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly
1, No Skip-Ahead function on this DVD: BABE is a wonderful movie
1, Dundee II: Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
0, Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months: I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
1, Oldie and Goodie: My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
1, Excellent stuff!: This face wash is great
0, Worse than surgery: The jokes in this book are not only unfunny
1, Amazing but not his best: This is Jimi's most famous performance
0, poor: The product did not operate as stated on the box. The supplier CDROMUSA wasn't at all helpful and left me with a product I'm unable to use; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They don't deserve a star at all
1," movies that make you THINK: How many times in our lives have we wanted a ""do over"" in our lives thinking if we could just ""change"" one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives. These movies make you realize"
0, Overpriced and too many restrictions on use: This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best
1, My recommended buy: Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware
0, Not good at all!: This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand
0, A Disappointment: I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but
1, The Power of the Witch: I loved this book. It's very informitive. I like the fact that my friend
0, Not Impressed by Cabot: I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style
0, A guide to one-night stands: This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically
0, Not entirely original...: Actually everything in the book IS helpful
0, Some reasonable advice.: I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these
0, Read The Art of Seduction instead: This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff
0, For anyone else
0, One of the worst spokeseman for my party..: Let this illogical hack please not defend my party
1, better than the swiffer: I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
1, My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!: I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop
0, Depends on your situation: I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference
1, Does a good job: Mach3 does a fine shaving job
1, Works just fine
0, Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.
0, Mach3 or crap3: Very poor quality
0, Somehow not as good as Birks: They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok
1, Very Nice!: My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach. It's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops.
1, good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys
0, Garbage!!!: I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item
1, Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise
0, Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading
0, Clapton masterpices: I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
1, Long Walk to Freedom: Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland
0, slow moving
1, A very beautiful coffee table book...: I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
1," worth the wait: It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the ""Biggest Prize in Sport"" album"
0," Not as expected: Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a ""regular"" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it."
1, Great Book on the Best Computer: This is a great book on the inventor of the Apple Computer. I have read it several times and done a couple of book reports on it. I highly recommend it.
0, Make sure product is for your GPS: I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX
0, Garmin 276C Power Cord: The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
0, THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO: THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO
1, Great gift Idea--they love it!: I bought this for my grandson who loves NCIS. He was so tickled. He is collecting the series.
1, another good season for an already great show: this is a solid season with several great episodes. the characterization is some of the best. it's not quite the same as we've lost Kate and gained Ziva
1, 3rd season of NCIS: This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
0, Very disappointed: The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
1, Season 3 is great!: Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd
1, A feast for the ears: I have had this album
1, Law: Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
0, Terribly Dissappointed: I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait
1, Great flick: I took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the 70's. He was a Marine who served in the Pacific and told ne how important this battle was. I needed to have it in my collection.
1, Close...: This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
0, terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
1, Great flick: Good movie
0, Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version: If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
1, Midway: I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now
1, Midway: Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans
0, Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo'
1," A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage ""Tora Tora Tora"" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in ""Midway"". It's not like they took scenes made for ""Tora Tora Tora"" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit"
0, I had a great expectation for this...: What would you get if you took a bad script
1, the best: its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent 
1, Intense
0," Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless ""dusk till dawn"" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's"
1, Excellent Look into African American History: I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work.
0, n/a: Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
0," Set of 2 40"" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba"
0, Cheap
1, Christmas present: Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
1, Victum Of Sinility: Ironically
1, Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up
1, A classic of its kind: This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies
0, WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED
0, Based On A True Story?: Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
0, 0 STARS: Talk about rubbish...you want to talk about rubbish?: Be honest people
0, Has live grain bugs: I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.

0, Discover a beautiful region of France: If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer
1, Awesome: I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for
1, LOve it!: I have really curly
0, disappointed: i loved the original poster i lost due to a move
0, Not a Great Book: I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
1, Finally
0, Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly
0, Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy
0, not worth it: If you have never used a flat iron before
1, Works well for thick hair if you have the time...: I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened
1, Conair Straightener: I have very thick
0, Does not perform the functions advertised.: This hair dryer claims to style
0, Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time
0, Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect
0, Baffled: I ordered it
0, Disappointing at best: Sadly
1, Love this thing!!: I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product
1, Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use
0, Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin
1, Great ink!: A few weeks ago
0," Structurally sound but: This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3"" and expand to 5"" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3"". So as long as these two items are not an issue"
0, Immoral movie: This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However
1, Entertaining tribute: The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and
0," They changed the words!: Don't buy this one either ... Unless you like grooving to the wrong words. I thought I was going to be sent back to the good old days ... Save your money. You won't get a refund! You can't call anyone. I got it ""DRY""!"
0, poor product: I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
0," she's so dull: She started out as the ""German Britney Spears"" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message"
1, It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
1, applied the knowladge: i have read this book with a great deal of intrest. it was a great help in implementing change and designing a organization structure that is able to deliver on the new strategy.
1, akjee: the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
0, A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However
0, forgive me.............: Ok
1, cursing in this 80's hit movie: For those who jest cant get over the part that there was some cursing in this 80's hit movie please consider that there's was more of that in the live action movie. The same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see!!!!!.... get over it! i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in Drag too!
1," MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video ""The Touch"" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated ""Optimus Prime"" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra."
1, Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries
0, Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!: This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X
1, One of the most beautiful creation
1, Best movie ever: I happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition I thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from Canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait
1," The Decepticons Learn A New Skill: HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice ""Edge"" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase."
1, Very Good: I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
1, A blast from the past!: Unlike many things I used to like and am rediscovering to find I dont like as much
0," disappointed by this board game: I bought this game because it promised a ""green"" experience for the entire family. i must say"

0, this movie is available on iTunes!!!: it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
1, Clear
0, I have such a Tooth-Ache: This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it
0, Unsatisfactory: I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately.
1, a thriller of what if times meet.: very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
1, Intelligent and heart-wringing: This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid
1, Illogical But Wonderful: Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie
1, Fun Science Fiction: This movie is a feel good
0, FRequency: Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense
1, A great character!: Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers
1, Enjoyable book: I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
1, excellant: this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw
0, The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys
1, Solitary Witch: I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one
1, LOVE: Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
1, Our favorite game
0, If you buy this
0, Tank top: I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
0," Worthless: Doesn't fit the average 10"" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround"
0, You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy
0, Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...: I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout
0, Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ
0, Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war 
1, Lee plays the good guy!: This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher
0, merlin: not that good. script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better
0, Did not speak to me
1, The Court Jester: Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children
0, Worst film ever?: By film's end
0, Horrible: I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens
0, Yuck
1, This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.
1, Great movie?: This movie was pretty good
1, excellent movie: This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
1," Real-life look into the life of teens: This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these ""KIDS"". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens."
1," dream: I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw ""Bully"" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending"
1," Not A KIDS Movie: Being a teen boy I wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks. To my disappiontment there wasn't any. Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce ""Casper"""
1, Nice Debut: Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff
0, Pretty but not made well: They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
0, something u would'nt expect: this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything
1, Our Father Abraham: Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior
0, Never got it
0, BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood
0, Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards: A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
0, It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read: Seriously
1, Love it!: The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
1," Never becomes passe!: I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to ""dazzle you with her footwork"". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there."
0, Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection
0, Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy
0, Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books
1, What's the fuss about Jane Austen?: I'm so sorry
0, Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen
1, Great Book!: This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book. The plot is ingenious
0, I Hate Emma: I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
0, Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book
1, Austen sparkles as always
0, Rubbish: What rubbish.Way too much violence. Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days? (or when it was made).Had a few laughs (I'm an ex-pat Australian) but not worth the plastic it was made from.Certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows.
1," Bernard and Miss Bianca Do It Again!: In Disney's ""The Rescuers Down Under"
1," cave twins review from grandkids.: Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
0, Incorrect information in this book: I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
0," Negative review - too basic and not too helpful: The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the ""don't buy"" list on our bulletin board!"
1," A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors!: This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ"
0, This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
0, Garbage - Avoid: The dimensions indicate 1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
0," freely available: Since those responsible for this animated version of ""Animal Farm"" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954)"

1, The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so
1, i love this book: this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
1, Great book: Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
1, A great book!: I'm sorry to give you this late response because I read this book today. This was an excellent book! I would recommend everyone to read this book. This book inspired me about not giving up on your goal.
1, ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS ON EARTH!!!!!: I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers
1, Great!: Oh
1, LOVE IT!!: Okay
1, AMAZING: As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
0, plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws
0, Not worth it: After finally finishing this book
1, My Comfort Book: This book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years. From Diapers to trucks and fighting
0, Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources
0, Awful movie.: Amazing
1, social scientists
1," Sowell is the soul of our time: This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as ""constrained"" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position"
1, Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
1," a must have: This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never "" stacked "" more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing"
0, they are posers: i bet you 10$ that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink182 listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties
1, This is a great CD: This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink
1, Mest above all: Mest is the greatest band of all time
1, Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest
1, Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge
1, I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert
1, Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics
1, Kick [behind] BAND!!!!: Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
1, Third and other streams: Well
0, Junk -- will flood your kitchen: Expensive and works for less than 3 years
1, This is my second time purchasing this item: I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
1, *THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total

0, 90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
1, Accurate: I bought this to help me when I started school to get my degree in political science and it proved to behelpful along with another book I bought for the same reason. I use them to decipher anything I am not clear on. Drink water when using this book because it's good for you
1," Mountain of contemplation: great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for ""the way of the pilgrim"""
1, Excellent for everybody: My 8 months baby loves it!!!
1, sesame street: Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes
1, Great historical novel: This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917
0," Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate ""How to"" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface"

1, A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses
1, i love it: I am very satisfied and I like it
0, Habent sua fata libelli: That book has a luck. It's the worst book which has ever been written. Strangely
0, Ulysses: This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
0, Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce
0, Italics are capitalized: Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also
0, Dirty and cheap: Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in? The case weighs about 1 oz and is ready to fall apart. The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty--covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt. The chips themselves are OK
0, not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..: i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like 11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
1, High quality
0, Poor Quality: The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
0, These Shows Have All Been Edited: All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage
1, Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin: I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin
0, There are better flash cartooning books out there!: In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12
0, Is book true?: In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany
1, Not Just Brokaw: I was terrifically moved by this recording
0, Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights
0, Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie
0, A very
0, One of the worst out there.: Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie
0," Torture to watch: I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a ""field trip"" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like ""Saturday Night Live"") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real ""Date Movie""."
0, always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...: The movie was funny the first
0, Dated and Dull: This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin
0, Worst movie in history: Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
1, great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green
1, Tony B -- New Chairman of the Board: If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board
1, Fun Family Film!: I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
1, Houseboat: This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper
1, a very meaningful and entertaining movie: Saw the bachelor in the cinema
0, Not much redeeming value: I don't mind implausible stories
0, Difficult Viewing: This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
1, Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.: This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album
0, Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase
0, Refund: This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
0, Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
1, Coconutheads: I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky
1, great product: it's the best lube i've used so far
1, Good Product - Stains can be dealt with: I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However
0, It is greasy: I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
0, There are better lubes by FAR!: We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife
1, Love it!: i LOVED this movie! i watched it in my English class and LOVED it! it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome. you never get bored
1, The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet
1, Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English
0, Romeo & Juliet: The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
1, the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance
0, But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great
0, More Groans Than Laughs: Weak
0, Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still
1, A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans
1, Love this movie!: I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
0," Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers"
0, Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels
1, Great Movie
0, Bad: The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
1, An amazing fun MOM book: This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though
0, Not the Planet of the Apes: This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film
1, Wonderful perspective shift!: After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face
0, ???: Don't even remember watching it
0, HORRIBLE
0, Women leave for all the same reasons: I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people
0, Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second
0, pretty bad: If you loved the first one
0, This should have been a good movie...: but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens
1, The Mummy Returns: I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the 1st film.
0, Forgot to mention this...: But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way
0, the mummy returns: I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars
0, ryan hickneys mummy review: this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
0, Don't buy this DVD: Unless you want to line Universal's pocket
1, Great Special Effects: Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
0, It stunk: This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
0, What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes
1, Good short history: Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN: 1-881366-01-4170 pages
0, OK as a monocular
0, RE: Mission Impossible: By and large
0, Impossible: Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie
0, Such shit: This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget
0, I was dissappointed: Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot
1, Nice Family Drama: This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
1, Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight
1, Book was a marvel of technical details and fiction: Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way
0, Brittle Fail: These cases are super brittle
1, Just what I was looking for!: This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic
1, Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off
1, WING FLY HIGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored
1, Yes
1, Excellent: All the Nancy Drew books are excellent - perfect to develop a 8 or 9 year olds love for reading. The stories are all so interesting. We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B. Jones have main characters that I would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes
1, Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car
0, disturbing: We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
0, BEWARE: This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child
0, Magic Thumb Tip: The thumb is very small (more for a child than an adult) and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick. Would absolutely not recommend this product at all.
1, Meooooooooww: When I read this title I thought it was going to be a funny story but WOWWW was it so much more. This is the sexiest story I have every read. Dammmmmm
1, A classic which keeps you guessing.: The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries
1, Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.: I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit
1, Yes
1, Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
1, the best: i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years
1, Riveting: Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it
0, Pretty much a waste of time: The story itself
0, Not What I Expected: This books has loads of information
1, to dream of love: This movie is unique and beautiful. Especially the character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).Still reeling from its beauty
0, The Emperor Has No Clothes: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring
1, great buy
1, My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator
1, Awsome: I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time
1, First epilator I've used: I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators
1, Looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything?: Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad
0, To engineer is human - I engineered a new beverage coaster!: I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore
0, Save yourself the time...: The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however
0, Had SO much potential....: I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising
0, I liked the backcover blurb
0, Don't waste your money: Although they appeared to be working (they glowed
0, Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
0, Poor stitching
1, Works with AVIC-D3: The new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable
1, (3.8)stars still good: This is not like their first two albums but it's still heavy.They don't have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it's still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess.This is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing.If you own their first two albums just know this
1, So far - très bon: AS described
0, Is it over yet?: After 4 months of trying to plow through this book
0, Crap: with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good
1, You're Gonna This Book: This book is a must read!!!! but not unless you've read City Of Masks and City of Stars. Hoffman creates and incredible world in (unfortunately) the last installment of this AMAZING series. You'll want to stay in Talia forever. This book had the perfect combination of love
0, We Are The World meets Journey: When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
0, TV goes out after 90 days: We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what
1, Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X)
1, Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian
1, Love it!: This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors
1," A good collection but......: This collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track ""Desperado"""
1, After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad
1," Suprisingly enjoyable: ""Blow"" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of ""blow"" is kind of hard to figure out"
0, DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir
0, Great movie!: I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
1," Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story: The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a ""big"" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other"
0, Heavy handed: While the acting
0, Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun
0, Please no more!: The third installment of Crocodile Dundee starring a subdued Paul Hogan takes place this time in Los Angeles
0, Not the Buddy Holly I know and love: My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK
0, Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first: This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
1, Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short
1, read it for your own reaction.: This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life
1, Profound
1, L'Etranger
1, A Good Classic: I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
1," goth background research: ""and the stranger - the killing of an arab""It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus"
0, SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_
1, Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist
1, Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school
1, Great Book
1, Good CD dictionary that can be better: This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version
0, No support for low screen res: The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way
1, Excellent Dictionary: I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language
0, not the worse film or acting...: but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz
1, Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie
0, A Train Wreck: This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy
0, 0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied: This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan
0, What a pity: Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
1, Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery
0, A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology
0, Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size
1, A great work of art: This book works on so many levels
1, exquisite: how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
0, Long Winded
0, WHY???: I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL
0, Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift: I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well
0, Must be made in China: I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it
0, Cute But Poor Quality: These are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Granted
1, This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen
0," Re-Releasing ""An Evening With John Denver"" under a different title!: If you already own ""An Evening with John Denver"" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! ""Boy From The Country"" and ""Today""...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?"
1, Bang Bang Kiss Kiss: This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw. But this is just the tip of the ice berg. Demos go way back to Impossible Shot
0, No idea about this album: I ordered this album
1, prattgirl: I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material
1, Letters of the Past: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson
1, Great Story
0, YUCK!: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every 1-star reviewer of this book is right on
0, Pathetic Dialogue: I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
0, This is Og Mandino at his worst: This is a fast read
0, absolute treacle: It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer
0, Majorly sucked: This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary
0, Just like Suzanne's Diary...: I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas
0, Tear Up the Formula: I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books
0, Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line
0, NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent
1, The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need: This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
0, disappointing: I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
0, Complete waste of time: I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
1, show the entire movie: Currently
0, really BAD Sony transfer.: Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night
0," Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is ""Night of the Living Dead""...The 1968"
0, Garbage: Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
0, Not for everyone: If your main objective
1, Sweet and funny
1, Adorable Fun Movie
1," Sweet Little Movie: I know that this movie got ""mixed reviews"
1, Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles
0, Not the best....: The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
1, For light comic romantic entertainment
0, Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version
0, duped: I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least
1, Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection): Via Amazon - Excellent service
0, no extra features!: I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of
0, Very Dissapointed: I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
0, Pinocchio not the only one who lies!: This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
1, It's a classic !!: How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again
0, This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie
1, Pinocchio 2 Disc Anniversary Edition: This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
1, love it: Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping
1, BD-live features mostly worthless: I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night
0, Not very good: I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week
1, The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math
1, Love it!!: I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
1, Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith
1, Good movie: Not much to say. Good story
1, Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society.: Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book
0, Predictable: The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it
1, The classic analysis on the internal life of boys: I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but
1, A Family Comedy That Is Out Of This World.: Suburban Commando is a 1991 sci-fi action/comedy family film which stars WWE Legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan
1, Great Flick!: Loved it in the 80's
1, funny and a little scary: We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
1, Good Entetainment: Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which
1," Awesome Picture!!!: Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the ""Picture Quality"" on the ""Tremors"" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome."
1, Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art
0, Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars: This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original
0, Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to
0, Received a used set: Nothing fundamentally wrong with it
0, A disappointment!: Having made the change to Veganism recently
1, Seitan Quickly: Cookbook on Cooking with Seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly. The book itself wasn't all I had hoped--too many weird ingredients that I can't begin to find--but that is NOT the fault of Amazon or the bookseller who sent the order.
0, Damaged goods: While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift
0, Screens wore out quickly: The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
0, Very disappointed: This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest
0, Not her best: I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book
0, insipid: this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
1, A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall
0, Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...: I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected

1, good overall toy: this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast
0," There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about ""breaking with reality"""
1, Wow!: We had heard about this item (and the many similar items) and decideded that we'd give it a try. Wow! We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent
1, Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
1, Excellent edition of the book: This is an excellent edition of the book
1, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (kindle): All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film
1, This is the Muhammad Ali of books
1, Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers
1, Kinda wish I had read the longer one!: This is BY FAR
0, Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo
1, The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly
1, The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next
1, The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
1, Superb
0, Terrible
1, Excellent: Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that.
0, Abridged version
0, Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
1, Great story of redemption: Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love
0, Thumbs down: The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
1, breath of fresh air: For the Love of Children
1, This book would make a great Mother's day gift!: This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer
1," Highly recommended baby doll!: This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect ""play Mommy"" doll. She appears very well made and durable."
1, This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first
1, IT WAS THE BEST!!!: IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
0, Ordered for Christmas but...: Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
1, One of the best movies ever made!!: This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story
1, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!: I always thought this was a lame movie
1, I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby
1," sexy/thoughtful: this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need ""brothas"" out there that still think like you."
1, 8701-Usher!: This cd is HOT ... I love it. One of my favorite Usher cds ever! Has several hits... One of his best ever! Must have for the fan of Usher! I am happy to have it for my own collection! Its great from start to finish!
1," LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!: Usher's ""8701"" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them ""I love you"". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are ""U remind me"""
0," who would have thought..: that this cute little guy by the name of Usher who came out with the awesome ""My Way"" would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as Britney Spears. Grow up Usher. Be a man. You either have the talent/personality/ and originality or you don't. Leave r & b and go be one of Brit's back up dancers."
1, 2nd BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!: Second to NSYNC'S
1, usher was creative then: now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
0, Don't Bother: A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
0, ewan mcgregor's hot: although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly
1, Riveting Reading!: Fast paced
0, good for a b-day prsent?: my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
0, TERRIBLE
1," Fast moving police drama: This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character (""Popeye"" Doyle).This is good police drama and quite entertaining."
1, Timeless
1, THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!: French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole
1, THE FRENCH CONNECTION: DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER
0, inadequate disclosure: Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
0, Low quality sound: The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
1, THE REAL PLAYAS: TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
1, GREAT resource!: I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
1, AWESOME!: Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
1, Crystal Growing Science Kit: This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child
0," I never thought Meryl Streep could give a ""bad"" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh"
0, Okay !!!!: This movie was okay
0, Too drawn out!: I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
1, Hilarious: This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended
0, Not quite...: Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments
0, Worthless!: They peeled off within a week. I cleaned the tub; wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface. I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well
0, I really don't recommend this product.: Purchased this a while back
0, drying and sticky: I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
1, This book is possibly the best I've ever read.: This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages
0, A story as lush as the planet it is set on!: Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't
0, A Great Book
0, predictable: After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
0, It;s just not very good: I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune
1, You won't regret: Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet
1, Brief
1, The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written
1, The best book I ever read: Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you
0, Great writing - poor publishing: ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print & editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous
0," Do yourself a favor and don't open it!: I rather liked ""Dune"" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series"
0, Sorry
1, Read the Series: I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two
1, DUNE ...Best Science Fiction Book I have ever read!: Of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it's the truth! I picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report... (yeah i don't read muchy for my enjoyment) but anyway i read it and now i want more. This book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing Dune Messaih and Children of Dune and can't wait to read them. Dune changed my outlook on reading with it's indept look at politics
1, A Lifetime Favorite: I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give.
0, Kindle version: I have climbed out of bed to write this for you
0, Embarrassing Ebook: After reading the Kindle sample of this book
1, DUNE is the book for our time: I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie
0, What was the point of this book again?: This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done
1, No doubt about it!: One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice
1, Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
1, Interesting continuation.: Like dune
1," just a few steps to total enlightenment: 1. Read the book during the summer-time2. Download the song ""Final Dream"" from the 80s movie ""Dune""3. Immerse yourself in water and/or listen to the song.4. Break out in tears.This book will change your life forever. :)"
1, Dune: Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one
1, Just the Best: Honestly
1, Not the best book ever
0, An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me
1, Warm and self sacrificing: Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
0, Horribly Disappointing: First
1, Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works
1, GREAT MOVIE: Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
0," Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no ""Mrs. Brown."" It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless."
1, one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read
1, Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play
1, My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre
1, Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it
1, Day-Timer stand: I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it
0, So where's the rest of it????: I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately
0," a sorry bit of commercialism: I should have known better after the ""Rose Red"" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that "
1, Great toy! Great service!: I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
0, Fuel Pump: Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly
0, Plays but is noisy: This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards
0, This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted: I started reading it
0," Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam: The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
0, Not a hero.: Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months
0, Campaign for Kerry: To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics
0, Waste of time and money: This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies
0," Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias: The following disclaimer appears on the ""Unfit for Command"" Swift boat book:""Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example"
1, Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York
1, what a world: A friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I have to admit it was way beyond anything I ever imagined. I have practically worn the CD out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music. Being a sax player myself
1, Chilling!: I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death
0, Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker
0," Misleading information: I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading (""GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver."" An initialism is hardly ""slang"") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to ""save batteries."" Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car"
1, A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying
1," This is one funny movie!!: This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie ""Clue"" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!"
1, personal top #10: If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
1, Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out
0, Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy
0, <*** This movie is BAD! ****>: I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions
0," Top 10 reasons you saw ""XXX"": 10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class ""Bad Movies 101"". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act."
1, Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!: There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound
0, Mindless
0, head for the XXX-it: I've only ever walked out of one movie
0, Unleaded: Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean
0," Triple Bad!!!: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond"
0, HORRIBLE!!!!!!: Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious
1, Good introductory real options book for beginner or manager: It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options
1, An American Classic: Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job
1, Captivating: Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice
0, deplorable: this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs
0, Pointless: This book was profane and pointless
1, Extremely unappreciated: This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics
0, Thou Preachest Too Much!: This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student
1," Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!: I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a ""well-reasoned"""
1, This is a great album
1, say YES to THE STONES: THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
0, the same thing.....: The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries
0, YUK..............: Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit 1970?
0, What a Bunch of Trash!: I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get
0, Oh
0, This CD reminds me of a not good CD: I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
1, Another winner: Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment
1, TL!: Bought this cd many
0, OK
0, Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school
0, thumbs down: All the children magically popping up
1, Improves with age...: I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment
1, Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome
1, Best Musical of All Time: Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
1, Can't get enough!!!!!: I have seen a few broadway shows in the past
0," Can we say ""overproduced""?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production"
0, Not for Children: Donny Osmond was wonderful as always
1, Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best!: I have wanted to see this musical for the last year
1, The whole family enjoys it!: I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago
1, Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version
1, Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD
0, Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated
1, I really like: the story being told. The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing. The biggest reason I purchased this DVD is the singing.
1, A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art
0, Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge
1, Some people...: This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
1, Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot
0, Stuff is great but don't buy here: Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty
1, Awesome.... for the year that it was made: Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good movie... What really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story. TCM#1 was the best out of all of them. #4 was the Lamest of all of them...but opinions vary.
0, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However
1, THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie
1, THE SAW IS FAMILY.: I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
0, Widescreen yes
1, so scary: im young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film.
1, Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days
1, Good
1," The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark masterpiece debut ""THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life"
0, DUMB DUMB AND DUMB: this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC
0, Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle
0, Despite great acting by De Niro
0, All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store
1, Top Notch: This film is shot well
1, Great!: When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im 15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out
0, this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all
0, What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure
1," ""He's Back!"": Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman"
1, good: this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic.
1, Queen of Hell: I only saw about a third of this movie
1," Re-Discover Your Music Collection!: This is a fantastic product! I am NOT a ""technical"" guy"
1," National Geographic ""Africa"" Series: Beautifully photographed. However"
1, If this CD doesn't perk you up
1, Damm Good Swing Cd.: This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones
0, You call this swing?: Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing
1, This cd will make you want to get up and swing dance.: The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite
1, Zoot Suit Riot is the best song on the album.: This album is pretty good...not as good as I had hoped. Zoot Suit Riot is definitely the greatest song on the album
0, Wasn't very impressed
1," THE best album of 1998. Period.: The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. ""Zoot Suit"" is the best CD of the year. On stage"
1, oh yeah: with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best
0, Awful stuff: I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
0, Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix: These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s
0, There's much better modern swing out there...: The swingin' sounds on this may rock
1, Absolutely Love Hoku!: I bought Hoku's CD years ago. I didn't even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD. I am now almost 18
0," Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!: Hoku's ridicousily stupid ""Another Dumb Blonde"" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde."
0, Another dumb blonde: Although she might say she's not
1, Great CD!: Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge
1, still the best: This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
0, Building the Custom Home Office: This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject. 154 pages dealing with ONE home office layout/concept. AND this is from 2002. Very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch. In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.
1, A cornerstone in brass-band funk: I first got this album in 1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
1, Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok: Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
0, the great queen seondeok: the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
1, Writers
0, their lesbian schtick is running thin: god
1, THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna
1, Tatu - Russian Music comes to the USA: Folks
1, These girls are definetely gonna get you!: Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them
0, Not worth it - taped @ extended/super-long play & inaudible.: Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
0," didn't see it yet but not buying it: It is not fair to call this a ""review"" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie"
0, Great cartoon
0," over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance: seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read ""the hobbit"
0, Missing sounds... how annoying: For the first time in my life
0, The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie
0," MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie"
1," Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by "" Orson Bean"") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon "" Smaug"". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with "" Return of the King"""
0, TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not
0, Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off
1, A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall
0, Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version
0, Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately
1, Now thats what I call a bible: Fantastic - it arrived yesterday
0, PRINT SIZE IS 6.2 NOT 9.5: I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
1, Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift
0, Caution before downloading: The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents
0, Tiny Font: I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
1, Good
1, Great for Gifts!: Super handy and looks legit
0, Too long: The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
1, Yamaha ipod dock: Easy to connect
0, Still have not received it: I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September
0, Could have been better.: I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
0, This film had a point to make
1, Great Remote Mount Radio: This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have
1, Inspired movie!: I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested
1, Can I give it 10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK
0," Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins"
0, you gotta know when to fold em Kenny: Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
0, Short Summary: These guys look like a couple of crackheads (especially the one on the left). Sad how they are being paid for this garbage. I guess a Jr. High School diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the ATL. Enjoy being rich and ignorant.
0, Breathtaking cinematography
0," Basically ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" With Different Ethnicity: Would have given it a 1-star"
0, Impassioned Drudgery: This movie
0, nibbling on kelp: Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet
1, Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie
0, A True Stinker: Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film
0, Great Work Of Fiction: Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.

0, Unable to return miss labled Stearns Rearm Kit: We have five SoSpenders inflatable PFDs model number 38APRO and ordered five rearming kits#0944 which state on the package that they fit the SoSpenders 38APRO PFD. The water sensitive bobbin in the kits does not fit the PFD and when we attempted to return the kits in the original packages to Amazon they would not accept them saying that they can not accept shipping of items that have gas in them. It is strange that they can ship to us items that have gas in it but we can not ship the same product in the original unopened package back to them. Now we are stuck with $120.00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us. Our recomendation is DO NOT USE AMAZON as they are a company that does not admit it has a miss labled or improperly packaged product.
1, Algebra: Structure and Method Book 1 (California Edition): No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact
0, I'm happy my order was canceled: After reading several reviews
1, GREAT MOVIE: I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings. I highly recommend the DVD version. The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant! Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better
0," Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in ""her voices.""Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story"
0, Miscast: This movie was 100% perfect
0," well.....it was okay: i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have ""joan of arc"" the savior of the republic of france"
1, Very historical: This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But
0, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History
0, Great music
1, Fantastic Book: A wonderfully written book. A superb plot. Great characters. Interesting setting. A classic. A must read. One of my 10 favorite works of fiction. Maybe even better than Shogun!
0, Never got the book and it's been a month...: I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
1, My kids love to read this over and over: I have 3 boys
0, not as good as i was hoping: when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not
1, Mac cover: I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one
1, Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford
1, The kids loved it!: Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day
0," Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!: CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: ""RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!"" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL"
1, Adoption message: This is a fun
1, A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!: This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!)
0, suartlittle: they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
0, not necessarily for kids: My two young children enjoyed watching this movie
0, Too bad no one read the book: This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse
1, A somewhat entertaining historical account: Given my odd sense of humor
0, George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be
0, Not very good: I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature
1, good: I am very satisfied with the product
0, dated...: 'Cheap and cheerful' is how I'd describe this book. Which means there are better
0, okay
0, Complete Waste of time / Film: The premise seemed alluring... saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future... But nothing makes much sense in this movie. all of The charactors can't think past their nose. What drives them on? oh yeah their unknown B actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic Sci-Fi... Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks
1, Everything is better with Jello!: Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez
0, Bad Book!!!: This book was bad..... in organization
1, Remember children
0, barely useful: Flimsy construction
0, Could have been better: I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads
1, Great product. UI could be improved: I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However
1, Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR 102 is a terrific radio
0, Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries

0, OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT
0, Like the idea behind the phone but not this one: this is my second cordless phone with a headset-this one I can not hear out of. I contacted the seller Rainbow Barter and they said all sales were final. So I tried to contact IBM sat on the phone 25 minutes the first time on hold
0, Broken Bottle: Ordered this set for my grandma
0, Chiefs: I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
0, Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However
0, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me
1, A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author
0, I didn't really like the book it was boring
0, very different book: i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.

1, As expected: I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected
1, This guy was evil: This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer
1, good for the tackle box: I got this as a gift for my 10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing. He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.
0, thank you: This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
0, One Star
0, Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD
0, Worst book from Whitman ever: The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone
1, My nephew loved this!: I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
1, This is a Great Product!: I bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for! But I was actually blown away by it
0, it stings: picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
0, Terrible Nickel Allergy triggered by strap connectors/adjusters: The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
0, Product is cheaply made
0, Genuine Chinese Crap: This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse
1, I agree: I agree with the review from August 8
0, LOUSY PHONE: Good Price with a nice package
1," Great CD: This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album ""So"" in 1986. Go through the track list"
1, Just what I wanted: I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away
0, poor quality: Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
0, Poor light - Looses charge fast: I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
0, Flashlight: Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
0, Reed switch doesn't work
0, Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...: I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me
0, Not Recommended: I am very disappointed with this phone. I have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone
1, Better than expected: I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is
0, Let's replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference...: This movie is just plain bad.Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie
0, Original thought: This movie had an original idea

1, Changing from a 20th Century status and power driven environment to a 21st continuous learning and collaborative environment: After Image is much more than a marketing and branding education. Grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the 21st Century. His explaination of moving from a work/status ethic to a continuous learning/collaborative/networking ethic provides a structure for individuals

0, Does not work with XP: After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box
0, How Could You Do This?!?: AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne
0, The worst movie ever: My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it
0, A Stain on Lucy Maude Montgomery: This final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the Anne of Green Gables story is beyond horrific. It is a stain on the memory of Lucy Maude Montgomery.
0, unimaginably bad: I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad
0, Disappointing: I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies. When I heard they were finally making another movie
0, Disappointing: This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately
0, dissapointed to say the least: I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again. This movie is an intirely different story. Not only was it a far cry from the book version
0, Not the same as Anne 1 & 2.: This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series
0, Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were 
0, Don't do it!!!!: The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful
0," Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!: There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the ""Anne books"" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes"
0," Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control: The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe"
1, great movie great service: my daughter and I love this movie. we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her 20's and we still watch it together.
0, Darcy: On it's own
0, I am very disappoinsted.: This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
0, Not as Good: I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere
1, still a riot
0, Not what I had expected: This course while extensive in activities
0," DRIVE-IN SECOND FEATURE: ""Are you really going out with him?""""UH-HUH"".""By the way"
1, Very good!!!: Is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc aren't up to those of his other recordings? Play this album back to back with So and you will notice that the sound on So is much crisper and cleaner. Anyway
0, Spend a little more and get a better router: I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
0, Easy setup
0, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!
0, Repeatedly Hangs: This router has good functionality and ease of use
1, Good Solid Cordless Phone: I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone. I have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer. I am a self-proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands. I think that Panasonic and Sony make the best phone and I think that Panasonic
0, ditto to horrible battery life...: my first panasonic 2563 works great...this 2583 won't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes talk time...and it's only two weeks old!!!!!!!!!!customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i'm looking for is a new battery...i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit...........i'm very dissapointed with them...never another panasonic.
0, Lousy support after the sale: We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement
0, Disappointed consumer: I had a Uniden phone for over 10 years which I loved. Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right phone and thought I had. I bought this phone about 1 1/2 years ago
0, Panasonic 2563W: Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also
1, Amazing set of cookware!: Its been a very long time since I reviewed anything...but this set deserves my time to review. Though I bought this set elsewhere
1, Yes another live album
1, Is Good: Yet another live Stones album
1, Unbelievable: I'll echo exactly what the previous 2 reviewers wrote
1, Our gritty female ancestors were amazing!: I started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that I couldn't get enough of their stories. Before reading this book
1, Possibly Gabriel's best solo work: I was surprised to see some relatively-negative comments directed towards PG's second solo album. I recently re-visited this album after many years
1, Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
1, What a great 80's movie: I watch this movie over and over. I've watched since I was a little girl and I still love it to this day. It's a very addicting movie.

0, Save your money unless you like pain: All I did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades. They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes. Beware.
0, There is no such thing as out smarting wall street!!: Is there really such a thing as out smarting wall street? They could have easily titled this book how to buy stocks that go up and short stocks that go down. Remember this book is from folks who don't know how to make profit in the business they run? Do you really want to learn how to invest from these people?

0, It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.: I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.

1," Earth Crisis said ""All Out War!"": And here it is haha!As soon as I heard there was a movie about straight-edge kids coming out I freaked. First I thought it was goin to be like a Hollywood straight-edge thing where they'd confuse edge with emo or something and I didn't want to see some edgers whining about girls. But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower. The first half was ok it was kind of boring and there were black & white parts that I still don't know why they were black & white"

1, Has lasted years and passed on from older brother to little brother.: This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise. It has lasted for several years used by one boy then passed on to his younger brother when he was interested in looking a bugs. It is easy to store on a shelf and find when suddenly a bug springs up that a boy wants to take a closer look at. the mesh cover is somewhat transparent but the best view is from the clear acrylic door not the side. No bug has ever accidentally escaped yet.
1, Elvira Madigan: This DVD of a 1967 Swedish movie was just as I have remembered it when it was first released. Great photography and great background music. A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family.

0, Check out before you buy: The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work

0, I'm sure it's useful if you could read the print!!: This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
0, Not complete does not offer the original word next to the Translation: I am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being. I was expecting a Compact version of my Strong's Concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness. It is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth.For example you will never know from this book that YHWH (Hebrew 3068) is used nearly 7

1, A blend of beauty and magic!: This CD is magical
1, Classic Lauren: Lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in. Music is awesome
1, Lauren you're the best and keep getting better: Lauren I love you and your music I generally don't liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote
0, Simultaneously pretentious and moronic: This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
1, Lauryn Hill is an exceptional music artist.: For anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists
0, A decent album
1, This Lauryn Hill at her best.: This is one of the most sincere

0," What a Shame: There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection. Unfortunetly it was also some of the best music from the movie. Why don't they put together ""real"" soundtracks that include all of the artists used? Instead they always give us their own watered-down choices. Bummer."
1, How can something so simple be so complexly beautiful?: When you play this CD

0, Oh Please!: Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I

0, Very disappointing: Being a huge Grisham fan
0, boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
0, WORST BOOK TO ME; OTHERS FIND IT BEST.: This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast
0, If You Want to Read About Small Town Living: At first
0," Grisham's not so stunning ""comeback"": This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years"
0, Fast reading
0, But....!: Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
0, The Man has lost it: I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books
0," What a disappointment!: John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each ""novel"" has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books."
0, The worst Grisham book out there!!!: I have read most
0, fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
1, A Character Study: The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development
1, A fun
0, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer): I read this book a while ago
0, Definitely not his best work: I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting
0, This is the worst book he has ever written: This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about
0, Grisham has lost his touch....: Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques
0, Last Juror: Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry

0, Offbeat Humor: I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie. This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.

0, service engine light: This cap has caused my 'tighten gas cap' light to alert numerous times. I had a hard time making it fit so i'll not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip. If you are buying this product for a 2004 silverado I would consider spending an extra 5 or 10 bucks on a cap that wont give you mentioned problems.
0, I should have believed the other reviewers...: Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it. It is pretty easy to set up
0, Too poppy: David Bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy-coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates MTV and radios all over the US.His new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual David Bowie. Too many generic drum and guitar tracks.Don't bother. If you're interested in buying anything

1, Loved it!: Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted
1, K&N air filter: This product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better - Its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine.
1, good breather: its a different shape than the stock filter for my 82' xv750 but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox
1, A great filter that gave me extra power: I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that
1, Good Purchase Experience: The filter was exactly as identifed when ordered. It was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment.
1, Great price: 2010 Honda Goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused. Plus I believe that K&N filters flow more air.
1, Not great but is okay: All right
0, Didn't fit properly.: I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in
1, K&N's for every ride I own...: I always purchase K&N air filters for every vehicle I own
0, Wouldn't work: The sharpener sat around for a month or so before I used it. When I went to use it
0," not heavy duty!: This sharpener is a joke. I have a small school and need to sharpen 10-20 pencils a day. Bought this ""heavy duty"" model"
0, Don't Buy This!: Expensive as it is
0, mediocre: In my opinion
0, This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS: This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact
0, quiet. then loud.: This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times

0," Drew Barrymore has made her ""opps!"" movie once again: Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie ""Ever After"" which i thought was a OKAY movie"
0, BORING!! But barley okey: This is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time . Even though Drew Barrymore is in it . It still doesn't steal the show . The middle was okey but the rest was just plain Garbage .
0, Home Fired!: It is a very good thing that Drew Barrymore did not choose this film to kick start her career. This film was a bomb from the word go. It was overly campy and completely unbelieveable. While the premise of the story is somewhat interesting
1, Best TV Series EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER: As the cover said
1," Great Art based on Great Art: This production need not be limited to ""ever made for TV."" This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again"
1, it doesn't ever get better than this...: they show this on PBS sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the 21 inch screen you can still see it. it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced! perhaps that is a story in of itself. in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century.
0, Brides head revisited: This product was ompossible to watch the sequence of episodes was all mixed upFor example episode 9 was only able to be played by pressing episode11 and so on.When there were three episodes on a disc the middle episode would not respondAnd could not be played.I was amazed to receive such an inferior product from amazon.

0, Beware of Seller: I ordered this book mid-April for Mother's Day. It did not arrive at the estimated time. I waited another week then contacted the dealer. They said I needed to wait the maximum shipping time before they could resolve the issue. It still did not arrive so I contacted them again and they stated that they would send the book now. I waited again and it still didn't arrive so I sent another email. Amazon has issued a refund because the seller now says that the book is apparently out of stock. I feel they should have said that from the beginning.
1, A good starter book to help focus on WWII books of interest: I really liked this book. I use it to further add books to my Wishlist. Dunnigan's mini-summaries of included books are loaded with details. I have several books by Dunnigan all of which I have enjoyed reading. Some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books. I try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored. Given his background and experiences

0, What a disappointment...: I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well
1, YesYore: Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks

0, I'm unhappy !!!!: I didn't receive this item. I live in Brazil and I asked to a friend of mine
1, Fantastic but: The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative
1," Pure magic: Morgan LLywelyn is one the most gifted writers writing today and ""Lion of Ireland"" is her masterpiece. You feel her passion and the love she has for the Irish in her words and her unique storytelling talent makes this book one of the best books I have ever read."
1, A truly magical book: This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie
0, Trite and predictable: I was excited to read this book based on the reviews
0, A big disappointment: I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages
0, Catastrophic Hissy Fit: How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it
0, POLITICAL ONLY: WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
0, Terrible: I found this book to be simply unreadable. Too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable
0, A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking. I expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps
0, Movie better than the book: I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book
0, Stay as a Blogger: This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is
0, Profanity detracts from material: I can count on one hand the books I have thrown away in my lifetime of 47 years. I treasure books and respect them
0, too much julie not enough julia: The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book
0, Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog: I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar
0, I did not like this book: After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant
0," Don't waste your time or money on this awful book!: Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The ""f"" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans"
0, I tried: I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now
0, Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook
0, disappointing: I love both cooking and reading blogs
0, Just OK: The character was self-absorbed past distraction. In fact
0, Horrible Recipes Made Bearable: As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter
0," Don't waste your money: Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's ""good"" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on"
0, Ick
0, I bought this for a laugh...: This is just hilarious. Mary-Kate and Ashley releasing their Greatest Hits 3 album- what could be funnier?! I don't really know whether to give this one star for musical ability
1, Must Have for Newborns: This was by far our most useful baby gift-- it helped our baby get to sleep and even saved our sanity a few times. Nothing calms a crying newborn better than a good swaddler. At first it's a little tricky to figure out how the velcro fits together
0, Simply put - does not work: I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one
0, Not for Baby Houdinis!: I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling
0, worse than a straight jacket: My baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled. Definitely the worst baby product I've purchased.
1, helps baby sleep better!: very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
0, Too big: Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it
0, Ok
0, Keep it tight!: Make sure its as tight as possible
1, nice gift: This is a very uplifting mix of Christmas music. If you like Celtic music
1, SMALLER than what it says on the prod description.: The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is 1 inch in diameter NOT 1 1/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.
1, oil rubbed door knobs: perfect size and color to replace the chrome ones when we did the redecorating in our bathroom -- lots of browns
1, look nice: they do look like the could cost you alot more but the quality really shows after time... the finish does remove from the knob over time but for me it wasnt a big deal since it was for a basement... but if you need if for a upscale kitchen i would pass but for a back room or an old drawer its perfect
0, Never arrived: I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
0, Made in China; that says it all!: Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China
0, N.G. For TIVO: I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters
0, i dont know if it works...: worked but a weird deal
0, Doesn't work and very frustrating: It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
0, Doesn't work and merchant won't allow returns: This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works
0, Wow! What a piece of junk!: I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably. Never got it working correctly. Netgear won't just let you install the drivers and be done with it. No
0, Don't waste your money!: Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first
1, Delicious: Our Shiba Inu
1, We all love this!: This is an excellent treat for my cats
0, No Mre sequals!: This movie did not fill it's axpectations
0, Big Fat Letdown: After the amazing Spider-man
0, I wanted to like it I really did!: I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.
1, Spiderman 2: Grade A+: This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action
1, Great movie!: I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
0, Marketing really does work.: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted
0, smallville anyone?: I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said
1, Spider 2 Strikes Gold!: This movie has an excellent story (better than the first). First rate acting
0, Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is
1, Very awesome<3: its full of action
0, Awful - Nearly Painful: I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff
0, Not that Good: The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
1, good
1," Better than the first: Remarkably entertaining movie. I still get chills watching the action sequences on my 27"" Television."
1, Great price!: My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
1, best hdmi player: best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics .price is very low .easy to convert to all region
1, Build Better Than Expected: Great product at great price (69.99 with free delivery). I recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video
0, Would be great if I could watch it: Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show
1, Wilbur Smith at his best: I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years
1, Excellent reading
0, A trashy
1, Fundamentals of Management: Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page. I feel this is a great book to get started with in management.
1, Well organized and easy to understand: My husband is using this book for his management class
1, So cute monogrammed!: The bedding I picked out did not have a diaper stacker...so this one went perfect. To tie it in with the bedding I got the top monogrammed. It looks so cute! Very pleased with it!
1, Follett's Guide to Usage: As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on
1, If you like the classics
0," No ""Classics""... RIP OFF: I bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer. I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included. It has such movies as Frosty gets Married and Rudoffs 4th of July"
0, get your money back: Big disappointment
1, Christmas Classics: This is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well. I knew what I needed to order (I borrowed the box set but I broke one disc so I had to replace the whole thing). This was the cheapest place I found it. The set arrived very quickly. Thanks!
1, Clasic Christmas Favorites: The grandkids loved this one. Not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen!
0, no little drummer boy 2: the trailer on this dvd set has advertisement for little drummer boy 2 but this dvd set does not have it instead you get pinnohios christmas dont know why warner did this but thats what is there
1, ....And I'm Not a Stephen King FAN!!!!: While I don't relish in Horror pictures
1, Should become a comedy classic: This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful
1, Charlie: He had very long nose
0," One good song: I like one song on this cd. ""It's in the Rain"" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them"
0, Predictable an uninspired.: Enya needs a change
0," A long wait for ""Enh!"" (yuk): Now"
1, You lose all cred ripping someone a new 'A' when you can't spell and make grammatical errors: I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'. I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii
1, A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice
1, Amarantine: More of the Good Same.: If you like Enya and you have them all
1, Whyte Weaves Wonders: A friend's Florida condo is as unlikely a setting to begin Whyte's Camulod Chronicles as one can imagine
1, Worth Every Penny!: What can I say
0, This doesnt do rage credit: The Cd is a disgrace
1, Looking Backward: I have a bad habit of diving into major events years after they occurred. I didn't understand Enron worth spit when it happened
0, boring
1, Very Informative and Helpful: For anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering
0, Larry Garfield is compared to?: When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
1, Great speech by Larry at the end!: Not a bad movie -- not great
1, Love having a female hero: My two and a half year old does not watch much TV but she loves Jane and the Dragon on Saturdays (she also likes Jacob Two Two and we have ordered those books as well). She was very excited when she saw the books as well. In a time when TV execs could not allow Dora to be on top (by giving Diego his own show) it is nice to have a female lead that is strong and brave but also sometimes makes mistakes and learns from them.The stories are interesting enough for older kids too.
1, Saw the TV show? Read the book.: If you have seen the wonderful Jane and the Dragon tv series you will enjoy the book. You hear the basic story in the theme song and wonder how Jane and her dragon met and what made the king let her train to be a knight. This book tells that story! It is an enjoyable story that engages everyone from children to adults. I highly recommend this book.
1, Great transmitter but not universal: I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!
0, cant rate
0, Read carefully before you purchase from Amazon - see below comments: I was upset with this Amazon purchase because when I played the movie (Frankie & Johnny
1, It's good
0, Don't Waste Your Money: I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it)
0, Doesn't work!: This sharpener did not work from the first time I attempted to use it. It only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener. It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak. I’m sending it back.I do NOT recomend this item.
0, Disapointing: I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
1, It works: All I needed was something to sharpen pencils with. We always get those cheap sharpeners that cost 50 cents at walmart.....no good. This is perfect.
1, A reading escape: I want a novel that is well written. A book with story
1, A knockout ride of a thriller.: Jeff Fahey's life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident. Turns out the arm came from a serial killer! Written and directed by genre favorite Eric Red
1, theres a new sherriff in town!!: thses guys rock
1," Reference Quality Blu-Ray Picture: This picture transfer on Blu-Ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your Hi-Def junkie friends.I can't comment on the lossless audio quality since I cannot decode quite yet.This is a ""must have"" for any Blu-Ray collection."
1," A movie that as it all!: Before I first watched ""I"
1, A surprisingly good adaptation: Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story
0, Not Asimov material: Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good
0, Oh
1, I
0, Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie: I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load
0, Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!: The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what
0, Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!: Drag
1, Maybe 3 and 1/2 Stars: I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However
1, terrific: The book was great! I have already recommended it to friends of mine. I would definitely read it again and again.
1, A peppy lil guy that gets the job done!: HIGHS: suction
0, For Those Who Like Intellectual Jibberish: If you liked high school poetry class
1, After all it is Poe: Great reading
1, Lullabies to paralyze: Well
0, Flummery: Surely
1, Water Filter: This is exactly what was described and perfect! It fits right under the counter and is so easily installed. We searched forever to find a decent looking spout along with the water filter for under the sink and we finally found Aquasana!
1, Best Steak Seasoning Ever: This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store. I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning. Unfortunately my local grocer stopped carrying it! I am worried I won't be able to find it any longer. It really is the best!!
1, my mistake: I bought this to replace the 'fish' that my dog loved and we lost in the woods. I was excited about the 'turtle'. When it arrived it is tiny! My mistake as it clearly states it is for small dog. My 70# lab does love it still. I wish the 'turtle' came in a size for a large dog. Overall
1, Nice to share: I don't like to journal because of the big
1, Great little journal: Received this as a Christmas gift from a dear friend
1, This is great!: This journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life. It makes you think of the positive rather than the negative. It is a must-have!

1," Funny! Funny! Funny!: Bill & Ted are killed by ""robot us-es"". They were sent from the future to prevent the birth of ""Wyld Stalions"" Bill & Ted must now challenge death & escape the afterlife to set things right. Side splitting fun! Recommended!"
0, That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man: That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
0," Way Too Small For Anything but the Camera: If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your ""stuff"" - nothing outrageous but things like cords"
0, Did not live up to expectations: Getting the book
0, Long and allegorical: Too long.May sound good if you don't know your Bible or Biblical History.The world won't end on 2011 either.
1, Any Fan will be happy.: I did have some concern from other reviews that mentioned the lackluster sound quality. I am very picky about my sound. But the price made me do it and I am happy I did. This CD had all the songs I needed to fill out my collection. The quality was not an issue at all. This is well worth the money
1, what's up w/ Jarrett: This is a great album of atmospheric
1, Nice supplement to study Meisner work.: Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
1, A way to understand the language of film.: As a college film instructor
0, Nope
1, Siempre hay que tener 2 baterías: Les recomiendo que siempre tengan 2 baterías

0, Good movie
0, DEFECTIVE PRODUCT: I ordered and had to return two separate copies of this DVD because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies.
1, Detour: Made by a Poverty Row studio in just six days
1, Great book: Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai. I bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful.
1, Path to integrity: This work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul . written some 600 years ago
1, Insight into the spiritual ideals of the Samurai: The translation may be a little enigmatic at times
1, Love This Mat: This mat is perfect for me. The 10mm thickness provides the cushion that I need for my ankles
1, Best Value for the $$$: Easy to put together. Came with very good and clearcut instructions.You have to have a good amount of floor space for it to turn though.Other than that it is a super buy!!!
0, One-Sided and incomplete: One can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that
1, I bought it by mistake.: First
0, Not So Great...: I purchased this video in a bookstore on Cape Cod last summer and was disapointed. Though I admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the Cape that I know
1, Touching tale of committment and love.: A young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard-earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive. Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story.
1, On time and new as described: Reasonably priced and shipped on schedule. Valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described. Pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy.
0, no accolades here: I threw this book in the trash
1," Unique Subject Matter: ""Come to Me"" is a book of short stories. Each one dealing with outrageous"
0, Poor: A very poor book. Don't bother. From the title
0, Neither Savage or Sensuous: I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
0, Greek: This was not a very good movie
1, Great book
1, A Good Resource Book: Grasping God's Word makes an excellent resource book for any personal library. It is written in such a way that readers on several levels of education may find it informative and useful. A strong emphasis on application of Scripture is much appreciated.
0, College book: Thank you for sending the book fast so that I could start reading it for my college class
1, Run a full size smaller - but toasty warm: I have several other pairs of slippers for winter
0, do not order these: I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on
1, Warm but less than perfect: Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried
1, Good Christmas Present: My wife asked for slippers to replace some old
0, Almost a whole size too small: I bought these last year and tried them on - too small
1, Great for the price.: I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
1, Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!): We brought this baby home
1, Widge: I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon
0, Bad product.: This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
0, decent products - awful technical support: I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However
0, Waste of Time.: Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters
1, Great look at the feastival!: I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats
1, Loved This Book!: Really opened my eyes on the myths
1," Box Of Hair: I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks ""Riverside"" & ""Not What You Think (Live)"" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs"
0, Poor performance: This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months
0, Terrible packaging: The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display. It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents. Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging.
0, Stupid Amazon Return Policy: Amazon won't take back the item
0, LWatLA: If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time
0, Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware: This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support

1, How to create comics from the man who changed them.: Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay
1, love this book: I love this book for reference on the job. It has tons of diseases and has a great format. I used the full version in nursing school so I found it easy to navigate when i started to practive. It also comes with a code so you can download the book to your PDA.
1, My Great Aunt Arizona: This is a wonderful book. As an elementary teacher I especially enjoy reading it with my students and own a classroom set. It is a beautiful story of a teacher and contains lovely illustrations. It is a sweet depiction of schools and life long ago.

0, Best Data 56K USB Modem Macintosh: As other reveiwers noted this modem cannot stay connected. You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain. Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights. Also Best Data tech support does not respond. There are bound to be better choices.
0, Not worth the title 'junk': I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box. I could not get my g4 1.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried. The tech support would not respond

1," The day the world came to town: Having recently watched a ""Made for TV"" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander"
1, A different look at 9/11: I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.

0," fair towards midland: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's ""Prose Edda"""
0, This light absolutely sucks: Don't waste time or money on this garbage - you can't mount it
0, Book Critic2: I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.

1, Steve Au: This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.

1, Love it.: I got this as a used product and got a good deal for it.The movie plays as good as new. I like the whimsicalnature of this movie.
0, unbalanced: This is an unbalanced view of the so-called AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Thabo Mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the AIDS orthodoxy. For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour
1, These are gorgeous!: I would expect to pay 6 times more for these lovely earrings in a boutique shop!I have received compliments on them everytime I've worn them!Beautiful!

0, Poor Graphics
1, Worthy Software Game!: When I looked at this game without opening it
1, ZooTycoon Rocks!!: Zoo Tycoon is the best computer game i've ever had! It keeps me busy for hours and I never get bored. With expansion packs it's even more fun. I would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos. You also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits. The graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too. It's a little hard when you start out but it gets easier. It's the best game ever!
1, Works fine at half the price: The picture for this shows a totally black tire
1, No kidding: My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.

1, Dain Curse in full: Love the quality of the movieI have a high def wide screen tvwent to the ROOT MENUthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreAdjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the musicBUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talkingI played it on my computer--and worked very wellI will have to deal with my tv later! It readjusted the whole tv system.Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.
1, Excellent Resource: I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education. There are ideas for everything from ice-breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time. While some of the ideas require more complex props
0, AWEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
0, Helpful but full of mistakes: Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
0, Kindle Version Must Be Beta: Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention. There are header lines (title and author)in the middle of the screen

0," There is more ""Bad"" about this DVD than just Religion.: This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs"
0, Disappointed - they tricked me: I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all
1, Truely awsome: Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the 1970's: solo

Still I am surprised at how much better the HTR-5590 sounded my first dolbly digital movie blew my mind don't forget i had a 1500$ 1995 model yamaha witch was very good too 
0, Unimpressed: The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however
1, A breath of fresh air!: This album is by far one of the best underground albums I've ever heard. It is a very unique blend of Russian/gypsy style music and good ole rock'n'roll. The magic created by this Colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years. I challange anyone to listen to this album and NOT be dancing their all over the place!
1, Good product
1, Outstanding noise canceling: I use these both in airline travel and at the gym. The noise canceling feature functions well in airplanes. In the the gym

1," Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting: Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other ""Jesus Chronicles"" by same authors about Matthew"
1, Great: This book is in great shape no missing pages hardly any damage. I am very happy with the service I received
0, Don't expect to pass the exam!!: I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well
0, Really Poor Product
1, The tweezer of tweezers: This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
0, Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer: I do not like the slant Tweezers
1, A good book for those with experiance with x86 assembly: This book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly; rather it goes into many uses of assembly
1, Worth it..: Explains how to view education in terms of the whole person. There are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach. This is the real genius of the author: he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know.

1, Addendum.: Mistaking the trees for the wood
1, Resonant.: This isn't on the level of Kangaroo Jack or Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle
0, horrible: Purchased because it was a good price and was comfortable for baby. Regret completely. The crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby. Worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning. Out of three carseats owned
0, Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start

1, The Death Committiee: A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
0, Not happy with this: The whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot I could see on the bike
0, Poor quality: This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
0, Disappointing video.: I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models
1, Too Complex: I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however
1, parts purchase: Kudos to the guys that helped me purchase this part. I had been through many local parts stores and everyone had me waiting many days or weeks even and alot more pricey. I will definitely go to these guys again and I highly recommend them!
0," Typical 80's T & A: I remember back as a teenager watching ""A Current Affair"" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line"
0, Not happy: I thought it was advanced poses. Instead it was some kind of breathing! It was a waste of my money.
1, Worth Listening To: The early years of Tangerine Dream produced some incredible music. Although Mirage lacks some of the drama of Schulze in the Tangerine Dream days
1, the BEST for many reasons: This performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos. Not only for the dancers and choreography
1, great package!: This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house

0," Helen Fisher's ""Final Solution"": This book makes it clear that Helen Fisher hates men. If a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective"
0, can you say CREEPY: Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell
0, What's the Point?: First of all
0, In-fur-iating: This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
1, Keeps 4yo son busy: It was easy enough for my son to figure out and keep him occupied during long car rides.
0," Another ""Poor little Women"" novel....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every ""poor me"" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable"

1," Unsurpassed ""Milkwood"": Richard Burton"
1, Great little product: I bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day. It holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car. I leave it in my wife's car during the winter months in case her battery doesn't start and it works great.Definitely a high recommendation.
0, poor construction for terminals: Seems ok at first
0, Poor product: I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.

0, Buyer Beware!!! Rain haven!: We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within 1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
1, Obsessive Genius: It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 4 1/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time.
1, AWESOME: Just got this sub to replace my sony 8 inch sub. I plugged this sub in
0, Where are the sources?: This book is fantasy. It uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a Right Wing conspiracy theorist. The author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should **NOT** be taken seriously. It uses eyewitnesses who were in Nanking as sources when they agree with the author; however then when those sources refute the author's opinion
0, revisionist history at its worst: According to this book there was no Rape of Nanking

1, You have to see this Sherlock Holmes Film ... !!!: This one had escaped me ... you cannot believe the Actor who played Minister of Magic ... Fudge was it ... in the Harry Potter Series ... I never liked him in Harry Potter because he was so fake and luke warm (wishy washy) ... BUT you will loathe him in this film - a nasty evil sort of dude - causing more uneasiness because of the psycholigical nature of his crimes ... you'd have more sympathy for him if he ran around shooting people ... not that that's good either .... he really makes a mean blackmailer. The only movie I've ever liked him in was Sense & Sensibility.
0, Pigs at the Trough: This was a very poorly written book. It was repetitive

0, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories: The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good
0, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot

1, Best crochet book ever!: I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than 1 or 2 in other books.
0, Mediocre at best: Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go).
0, Errors and more errors: I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However
0, Please.....: Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice
0, Lives in denial: Having read most books on Krishnamurti
0, Warning will not play: WARNING....be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD. Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it.
1, Fantasia Amazia: Fantasia always has a great product and once again they deliver. These pencils are superb and sturdy. Great for the half hazard artist whose product ends up all around them. These pencils crashed to the floor often and were not affected (Note: I do not recommend dropping ANY colored pencil)
0, not what you think: First off this helmet is enormous
0, One Star for Amazon!: All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote
1, Good Clean Show: My daughter requested these for Christmas. She watches them over and over. This is a good clean show for teenagers. Highly recommend.
1," ""Fellini-esque"" Tradtional Brass Band Gets Hip: Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy"
1, Easy reading
1, Carry Me Across The Mountain: Dan Tyminski's CD Carry Me Across The Mountain is cool and on the cover of the CD is Dan Tyminski playing the F - Style Nandolin.
1, I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN!: This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages 11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
1, My favorite book!: Don't listen to the people who are giving this 1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
1, adam s31: I thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end. I am deffintly reading Eldest and the rest of the series
0," ""I love you"
1, ADVENTURE MAGIC AND ENCHANTMENT!: I loved it!!!!!!! I begged my Mom
0," I think I've read this before.: Wow. I've never seen so much ""borrowing"" done. It's amazing!In my opinion"
0, horrible: One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift
1, Good read
0, Cute story but its been done: While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him
0, Bland.: The kind of repetetive
0, Rip Off: This book was The Dragonriders
0, If their was a -5 Star... I would choose it..: I definitley give 'Eragon' a -5* star. I would if it were an option.Some well known 'funnies' to eragon1. Aria and Eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister.2. Eragon is mad at Murtagh for being not 'merciful' enough
1, Five stars doesnt even do it enough justice.: FANTASTIC!! AMAZINGLY THRILLING!! Paolini deserves an A+! very original
1, An Awesome Read!!!: Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages
0, it's not worth reading: There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally
0, ewww!: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was quite interesting
0, I don't care how young the author was at the time...: It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive
1, Great audio theater!: I had already read the book and the Eldest book before purchasing this set. It is an excellent quality audio book. It amazes me that one man did so many different voices. He is an excellent actor. The dragon's voice sounded funny to me at first
0," ""I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN-BOY TERRORISTS!"": [...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality"
1, Eragon: Have you ever been in a place where Riders and Dragons Rule? The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon
0, Childish and too unoriginal: The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom
0, I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old
1, Some southern girl
1, Almost Amazing: The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.
0, Obviously writen by a 15 year old: This book may have a good plot line
1, Eragon Book Review: This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action
1, I Love this Book!: Wow! This was a great book. I anticipate the rest of the trilogy. I'm a fan of Pern and when Anne McCaffery had rave reviews of Eragon
0, Hmmm: This is alright for a beginner but
1, A knockoff--yeah
0, Cliched
0, Needs works: I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully
0, Not too great: this book is a major acomplishment for a 15-16 year old
1, great book @#$% the bad reviews: the inheritence series is a great series to read. i loved every word in it. Also read the next 3 books
0, A REAL STINKER: Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
0, Borderline Plagiaristic: Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
0, Had he been much older
0," I Could Write A Better Book: The only thing that grabs any attention to the ""Inheritance"" series is that Paolini is only 17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old"
1, Best fantasy book ever: Despite what other people have said about this book
1, Fun read.: This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it
1, Very Entertaining: I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While it is a bit derivative
0, Boring and bad writing: All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
0, Save Your $ For Something Worth While: Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book
0, don't leave me hanging: I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic
1, Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land
1, Exquisite and Riveting: When I had first heard of the book
0, boring and
0, Not even close to the hype: Poorly written cross of Pern
1," Eragon: I got an ARC of the upcoming Random House release of Eragon at the BEA in Los Angeles; read the book on the way home. Out of curiosity I got a copy of the self-pubbed book to read and compare. I loved both! I wish the best of success to the young man.The Random House reps are spreading this review of Eragon to the trade: ""Full praise to Eragon and I want more! A winner ... tip of the hat to young master Paolini.""--Anne McCaffrey"
0, Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many
0, Two things: Eragon has two things going for it:1) The cover. Come on
1, A Kid's Review - Awesome Book!: I'm 9 years old and I really don't like to read very much but my mom suggested i should read this book. I started reading it and loved it. Eragon is an awesome book and i think everyone who likes action-packed fantasy books should read it. its about a teenage boy who finds a dragon egg and raises it to be a powerful beast. Together they go on a journey to fight the evil king Galbatorixs.This book is 497 pages of fun. I can't wait to read the next one!
0, Yuck!: Shallow characters
0, You Can Run But You Can't Hide: This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
1, excellent effort: Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago)
0, not great
1, An entertaining read: Is it the same world that others made up? Yes
1, Eragon is amazing: Eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family. He tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead. He did not know what was inside of it. One day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out. Then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon. But then Eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire. Read this book to find out if the firemaster dies. This book is for eight-year-olds and up.
0, Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived
0, verbose!: This book is full of adverbs and adjectives and extremely verbose. Sounds amateurish. Lost my interest. Stick to established fantasy writers to get your money's worth from your reading.
1, WOW!: A wonderful book full of fantasy and wonder. When you think you have the plot figured out it changes and changes again. Better than Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in my opinion!
0, Geez.............: As other reviewers have alredy stated
0, I really wanted to like this book: Really
1, Good
0, Even for a seventeen-year-old....: This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read
0, wow...what a disgrace: oh my god. this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats. this is not in any ways original. what is happening to childrens fiction these days.
0, Meh ...: This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds
0, Not impressed: The author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the Bible with not one reference or footnote
1, Learn the lessons in the Bible: To be able to go through the entire Bible
0, The book was great
1, Light
1, Positively hilarious: This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative
1, Creature Comforts Christmas: I really love this short movie
1, interesting: I found the book interesting enough to stay reading it. I was never bored with it. I am always looking for a good western!
1, ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION !!!!!!: Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
1, Harry Potter Movies are Outstanding!: The Harry Potter movies are great! My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. It has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected. It was closer to the book than I expected.
1, great prices: I was very happy with this item! it was shipped quickly and it was still in the factory packaging just as promised. and the price was perfect! i watched it the day i got it.
1, Harry Potter Rides Again: Another fine adaptation (though you get the sense that they could have added in more). The students are growing up
0, Guilty: Drek in the First Degree: All of the Harry Potter movies (as well as the books) are artless adolescent
0, Is this a bootleg copy?: I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites
0," Bait and Switch: Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this ""Ultimate Edition"" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I)"
1, Very Entertaining: I'm not certain that this edition is better than the dar kand disturbing Prisoner Of Azkaban
0, Italian language available ?: Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
0, Not extended!: There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.
0, What a dirty trick: Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home
0, Betrayed: If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
0, why a director is able to ruin an adventure of a lifetime: harry potter movies 1 and 2 and 3 are excelent.they cut
0, Good job
0, Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway: Goblet of Fire
1, Very cool book!: Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great
1, Greatest author: This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade
0, cheesy/boring: sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this?? people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all. its not tht great honestly.
1, There and back again
1, nicely done: this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well
0, What a HORRIBLE book.: I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on
0, Well this book wins the award for the most boring
1, Deluxe Pocket Edition: I own many copies of the Hobbit to include the audio and ebook. This is a perfect travel version and read it often. Font size is perfect for me and the maps in the cover are great for quick reference. I have noticed a large number of one star reviews for this product that have nothing to do with it with most being either the Kindle version or the audiobook. Take heed when you look at the reviews.
1, All time favorite: This is a classic that can be read over and over. Good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too.
1, I loved it again!: I have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes. I don't have to hunt any more. It'll always be on my Kindle.
0, The hobit: The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
0, How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?: If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away
0, the stupidest book i have ever read!: i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time. i hated it. i found it very hard to get into with all the characters listed in it. i would give it 0 stars if i could.
1, Amazing:): I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings
1, AMAZING: This is the best book ever
1, Classic: There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great
0," Don't buy the audiobook: Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore ""The Hobbit."" My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child"
1, Hobbit: I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow
1, I read it again after 30 years - still good read: Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy
0, good only for insomnia: Actually
0, The hobbit: Disappointed didnt receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful
0, LOTR is better: i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
1, Good: Quick and e as y read. Pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them. Good digital copy.
1, Slow but good story: This book takes a while to get into but I guess that is to be expected with an older novel and with Tolkien's writing style. However a good story overall and worth reading.
1, The hobbit: I am not much of a reader but I must say I really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures
0," Am I missing something?: I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them"
0, Little people versus a huge dragon: The little people win
1, Great book to a Great Series...: First off I gave this book a four because
1," Some people...: Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that ""make"" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like ""The Scarlet Letter"". I am jealous of you people who were ""forced"" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read ""The Hobbit"" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?"
1, Good Book but no music on Kindle Touch: The book is fantantic
0, Poor edition for Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD: I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition. But you cannot so let it be known this is about the edition. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to provide this book in its' most complete form only on the iphone/ipad. The book on the iOS platform has the audio available within it. However
1, awesome little book: This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it. It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages
1, This book is absolutely the best!: I read this book 10 years ago
1, Gorgeous Book: I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me. Its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time. Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished.
1, Wonderful!!!: I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit
1, A Fine Beginning: While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings
1, Awesome!!!: This is a great tale I loved every second of it! It is by far one of the best stories I have had the pleasure of reading!
1, lived up to the expectations: was a great book. Unlike LOTR which i tried to read once
1, great but not outstanding: I enjoyed Anderson's book
1, Always enjoyable.: Like visiting with old friends and enjoying a lovely chat. I've read this multiple times and always find the adventure great.
1, The Hobbit is exceptional: The story is adventure and adventure. Exciting and thrilling
0, Somewhat Overrated: The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created
1, Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkien: My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit
1, Amazing book!!! <3: Best book I've ever read!! Love it. Recommend lord of the rings as well. J. R. R. Tolkien really is an amazing author!
1," ""The Lord of the Rings"" Light: This is LOTR light; Well written"
1, hobbit: When I read the hobbit 
1, Adventure
1, Classic: I fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child. Now
1, Pretty Good Book: The Hobbit was grappling! It made me feel like I was the main charecter. The book is about Bilbo Baggins
1, An amazing novel: I am sure there are many reviews for this book already
0," The epitemy of Fantasy: This ""book"" is a travesty to everything ever written. Swoar"
1, Best book ever!: Why 5 stars? Because it's the best freaking book EVER!The Hobbit has
1, The Hobbit: I had never read this book
1, Trail Blazer: Arrived on time in New
1, Great listening: We bought this at our daughter's request. When we saw that it would take 11 hours to hear the whole book
1, Classic: We bought this book to read together with our son. It was a great experience. We also got a few Lego sets to bring the book to life.
1, Fantasy Master: One of the best fantasy novels ever. Many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story
1," The Hobbit: Although The Hobbit tends to be a childs book it is a must read before the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.It is also about to hit the big screen."
1, A Magical Tale: I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun
1, Enjoyed reading again after so many years!: I read the book many years ago in high school and wanted to read it again before I saw the movie. It is a classic and I loved being introduced to all the characters once again.
0," Hobbits are just another type of Elf: I would strongly recommend this book to those who play ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book"
1, supurbe: Cain CoxELA 8The Hobbit/JRR TolkienBook review10/1/03The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo. In the book the hobbit gets taken on the adventure of his life.In one of his adventures he meets some trolls that have a cave behind them and he is sent to look in the cave to look. But before he can get into the cave he gets caught by the trolls. The only reason that he was alive was that a wizard saves him.I thought that this was an exciting and adventurers book. It had a great plot and a great story about wizards
1, Perfect compatibility: Checked with Sears and they could no longer help. I had one remote that I had to hold just right to get it to work.I ordered two of these remotes. The compatibility match is perfect. These are exactly as described. It took me longer to get the ladder out
0, Didn't work: This product tho it seemed to match our current one
0, The Bad Outweighs the Good: This could have been such a wonderful book. The prose was elegant
1, Book was good: The book arrived in excellent condition. It was a fast enjoyable read. Although
0, I don't like it: As a man
0, This is the problem with American Women: If you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship
1," Beth: This book is fabulous. I am a 25 year old female who has always been ""the nice girl."" It's not as if I haven't had relationships. Yet"
1," Why Men Love Bitches - THE BEST there is!: Sherry is an EXCELLENT and THE GREATEST writer there is!!! A MUST read for all women out there!!! This book is the absolute BEST! ""T-H-E B-E-S-T!!!"" The contents in the book are amazingly true and ""real""!!! No other relationship books can be compared to this! You just HAVE to read it and you will see why Sherry is so AWESOME!!! Be your own judge! I love it!!!Sherry teaches you all the PRINCIPLES that EVERY WOMAN should know.... to believe in yourself... and put yourself first.... start counting yourself as Number 1 instead of Number 2!!!Sherry"
1," One awesome book for any woman.: I was the ""nice girl"" before reading this book. This book has helped me so much when it comes to dating. I find myself being happier in relationship than ever before. If you give to much to any man in your life I STRONGLY suggest that you buy this book you won't regret it. I'm even going to buy this book for my closest girlfriends. Before dating another guy read this book he will help you out tremendously."
0, Not completely accurate: This book is directed towards a certain type of women
1, I can't believe how amazing this book is.: I am/was your classic doormat kind of girl and I realized that I just might be doing something wrong. One day I was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book. In the first 10 pages I learned what exactly I was doing wrong. I recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat.
1, great book on dating!: This book is hilarious! But it is also very helpful. I learned a lot of new tatics and approach. Women have a lot of power and when used properly we can get what we want from a man.
1, Wonderful!!: I have told all of my girlfriends single and married about this book. It is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them. We as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works. I have always held my own in a relationship for the most part
0, I don't know if this really gets to the point: I am a fast reader by nature
0, WOW!: This book was manipulation and games to the max. I understand why guys think girls are so crazy sometimes
0," The title should be ""FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF DATING MEN"": If you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue"
1, Girls! It's so true!: I personally loved this book! It gave me a completly different outlook on relatonships and how to hold my own in one. I used to be auch a doormat! Seriously
1, good video for beginners: This video is a mix of streching and extrememly light toning
0, A hodge-podge of personal trivia: I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school
1, Crichton at his best.: The book arrived ahead of the promised date
1, Not typical Crichton fiction: Travels is a fascinating
1," AKA Bentley Little: Horror writer Bentley Little moonlights in the suspense genre under the pseudonym ""Phillip Emmons."" Gruesomely original with the most politically incorrect serial killer ever committed to paper. The final setpiece in a Phoenix hospital"
1, FYI: Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz
