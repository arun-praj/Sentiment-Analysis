1, Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this
1, One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game
0, Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However
1, works fine
1, Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection
0, DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works
0, Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this
0, DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features

0," Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly"

0, Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke 
0, A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5)
1, TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
0, didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power
0, Don't buy!: First of all
1, Simple
1, Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99
1, SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas
1, Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
0, Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation
0, Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
1, one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
1, Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small
0, Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable
0, Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms
1, works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed
0, Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device
1, wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk
0, Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange
1, This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire
1, Mary Ash: Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
1, Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash
1, This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
1, They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time
0, Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
1, Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
0, Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants
1, Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do
0, Light reading
1, WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop
0, Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book
1, Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI
1, Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times
1, Amazing...: love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
1, Leslie in a nutshell: Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal
0, More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love
0, A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date
0, Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry
1, Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well
1," Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"""
1, Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell
0, 12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell
0, I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However
1, Wonderful
1, No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
0, Disappointment at it's extreme: I had never read this author
1, From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
1," An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the ""evil"" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give ""gifts"" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say"
1, great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie
1, Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
0, Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough
1," Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The ""sale"" prices are right for a high About end racquet"
0, A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
0, Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure
1, sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky
1, Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
0, Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy
0, Broke the 2nd time I wore it
1, The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture
1, Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core
1, I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6
0, WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach
0, CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off
0, Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
0, nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
1, Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while
0, conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist
0, Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development
0, 1
1, Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
1, I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
1, A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing
0, where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
0," Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.""There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language"
0, ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
1, The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
0, This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so
1, Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
0, A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great
0, Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer
1, Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston
0, Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
0, Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor
1," The ""Scarlet"" Letter: Much to my amazement"
1, The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser 
0, The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book
1, This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter
0, I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
1, Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow
0, same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap
1, Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small
0, Unreadable!: As good as this book may be
0, Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance
0, Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree
0, one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz
1, Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie
0, very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie
0, Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids
0, Not the worst
0, Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have
1," It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board"
1, Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition
1, great IMO: First of all
1, I wish...: ...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...
1, Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg
0, WOW!: This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability
1, 80s Hard Rock: One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It's pity that they are almost retiring soon...
0, Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80's died
1, Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review
1, Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
1, Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
1, There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest
1," I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! ""They don't know entertainment"" as Krusty would say: I do love ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"""
1, Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
1, Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music
1, great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
1, Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
1, The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this
1, Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself
0, Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides
0, After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months
1, Works great
1, This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop
1, Quite Satisfactory: This product works well
1, Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price
1, Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging
0, Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
0, Cheap
1, So much better than the apple version!: I love it
1, Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply
0," If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14""). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery"
0, Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4
0, Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package
1, Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family
1, TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente
1," Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull"
0, book only
1, Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
0, Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension
0, Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology
0, Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider
0, Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper
1, Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever
1, My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much
1, Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception
0, I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
1, Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch
1, Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white
1, A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason
1, I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
1, Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
1, Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
1," Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's ""Hungry Again"
1, Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child
0, Band saves CD: As usual
1, Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5
1, The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
1, non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him
0, worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
1, One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old
1, excellent: Good price
1, Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends
0, Maybe next time...: I
1, To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome
0, Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released
0, Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
0, Great Work
1, this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout
0, Good
0, a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material
0, BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
0, Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to
0, Well
0, Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
0," Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of ""executive summary"" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this"
1, The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times
1, Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome
0, elem diff e-q's: While the shipping was AMAZING
1, This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
0, Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade
1, A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people
0, Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?: I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small
1, Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch
0," Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8"" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger"
1, The meaning of God
0, What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it
0, You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set
0, junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
1, fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
0, Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
1, Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river
0, Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking
0, Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages
0, Stuck With You: I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book
1, None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed
1, Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included
1, Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted
0, lousy
0, Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
1, Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book
0, broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.
0," Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the ""ON"" button"
0, Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow
1, Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
0, THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE
1, Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod
1, LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent
1, CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
0, I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful
0, More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction)
0, waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use
1, CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
1, Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all
0," ""THE ROCKETS RED GLARE"" ???: This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on"
1," Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of ""shaky"" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price"
1, A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible
0, Love Jerry and Dean
0, Crap
1, Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings
1," I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: ""For office slaves"
1, An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
0, not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However
1, Typical Thomas video
0, Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also
0, Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
1, Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth
1," ""Like this"" by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70's by using a sample of the classic ""clean up the ghetto"". Monday Midnite's freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus"
0, A Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter
1, A peek inside the process.: First thing's first
1, As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad
1, a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history
0, Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer
1, Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product
1, Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.
1," I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found ""Quaker Oat Bran"" here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too."
1, Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print
1, Its a cable: Its a cable
1, awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
1, I'm grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child's fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn't promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime
1, Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian
1, Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me
0, USA1: Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I'm sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.
1, Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial
0, This book is messed up: In this book
1, Impressive: One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore
1, The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...
0, Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected
0," SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!: Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel"
0, And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot
0, Mothman proficies ?: 257 pages covering Men in Black
0, Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I've waited years to read this
0, Are you joking?: I'm giving it one star because less isn't possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction
0," fine if you support terrorism: I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-""Growin up"

1, So Original
0, noritake colorwave stoneware: I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it

0, Tiene que ser sensilla!!: Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama
0, Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead
0, Worst book I've ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was)
1, Frankenstein Continued??: When I first heard about this book
0, Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers
0, My [Goodness]!!!!: world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire

1, YES
1, A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
1, Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided 
0, If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.: I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album
0, Ehh: The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.
0," ""True"" Nirvana sucks: I'll tell you what's REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are ""illegal"". Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is ""true"" Nirvana"
0, garbage: Complete garbage
0, Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.
1, Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color
1, Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader
0," The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word ""ficbe"" came about as a result of faulty character recognition"
0, Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well
0, Lame Jujitsuka: I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them
0, Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and
1, Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third): In the forest of Midworld
1, Best Alan Dean Foster book!: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen
0, Plain Putrid: This book is so obscene in some parts
0," Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read ""Tess"" for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video"
0, Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.
0, Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
0, The book was boring
1, Obligatory: My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
1, Good Companion Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.
1, Great classic: I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations
1, Beautifully written
0, I hated this book then....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there
0, Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition
0, Ummm: I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury's sill out for me...
1," Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
1, Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression
0, Please read Kundera's book instead: Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing
1, Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film
1, Milan Kundera rides again...: A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book
0, Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.
0, The Unbearable Length of Worker & Parasite (End Spoiler): Basically
0," disappointed: I have been very impressed by other ""pickin on"" music: Lynyrd Skynyrd"
1, The birth of Drone??: As far as I know
1, Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples' private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life
1, Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new
1, Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo
1, Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author)
1, On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot
0, Flat Kerouac: I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty
0," Self Indulgent Nonsense: The operative word from the title is ""bums"". This is a book about them and their self indulgent"
0, Outlines of Theology
1, Life changing!: This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I'm want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
0, not worth it: mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
0, WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it
0, Not really a good movie: This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover
1, transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
1, Loved It!: I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
1, Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME

0, Another 'video game' type of movie
0, Great eye candy
0, Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.
0, Transformers: Dark of the Moon: By most accounts
0, The movie itself is ok
0, The perfect movie
0, Lights out on this awful film: I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot
0, Not that great: The first transformers movie will always be the best one
0, Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12: I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably
1, Love this movie: Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.
0, Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact
1, Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner
1, Transformers Dark of the Moon: A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
0, Movie is ok
1, Guys Movie: So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions
0, Never thought I'd miss Megan Fox!: I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime
1, Transformers: Dark of the Moon: watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much
0, Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....: I know a lot of movies aren't going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers
0, Safety pins: As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash
0, Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler: Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!
1, B-Movie-Licious: I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised
0, Hell no.: Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it
0, What a complete and utter waste of time
0, Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!: I've had many problems with Sony computer items before
1, Sony E-Marker is now obsolete: Excellent Product
1, good idea
0, Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented
0, worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing
0, Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through
0, Sony has pulled the plug: Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However
0, Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
0, Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately
0, Artwork???: Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn't even scary... WTF You've ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.
0, Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid
0," ""I Can Read"" book has better illustrations: While the stories in the ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" book remain the same"
0, The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...: I was very disappointed to discover that the copies
0, Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster
0, Tongue hurt my ankle: The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately
0, Buy the 1993 version instead.: I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns
1, Protection Advice: All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger & larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about
0, know the source of your information: While there is some very good information in the book
1, Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.: We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that
1, Viewed it yesterday: This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?
0, Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film
1, Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out
0, it sounds great!~!~!~!~!: it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?
1, It's a very reliable printer...: I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is
0, Grindhouse?: I guess I'm not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.
0, Am I missing something?: Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it)
1, Is honesty always rewarded ?: Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty
1, LOVE THIS BOOK: I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not
1, Awesome if not overplayed: The first 5 songs are incredible
1, A Great CD for all people: I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus
1, Beyond the mega-hit
1, It's Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.
0, The One Star: The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually
0," I won't buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
0, Non Computer Geek: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER
0, Curved Thomas the Train tracks: Again
0, O-o-okay: Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then
1, Heads above the first book in the trilogy: I was so disappointed in the first book
1, Good book: I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say
1, Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy
1, Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation
0, Good politics
1, Asimow is one of the best writers of all times: Foundation
1, Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre
0, Don't Bother: Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However
0, tough going: I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally
0, Dissatified: I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series
0," Goes ""Haywire"" Regularly: Setup was easy enough"
1, Old fashioned
0, Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
0, worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10
0, Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie
0, LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
0, What did I watch?: So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
1, Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest
1, If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker
0, Banal and Boring: No
1, GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it
1, Amazing Score.: Wow
0, Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design
1, Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
0," It's too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of ""dummie"" and ""KISS"" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste."
1, Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables
0, awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I've tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can't find packaging.
1, Good grill for the money.: I've been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I've used it to grill steaks
0," Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn't agree more w/ Prendergast's review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called ""classic"" and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book"
1, entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
1, one more positive note: Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls
0, Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks
1, This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia
1, Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times
0, AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest
1, Oh
1, Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray
1, Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
1, Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture 
1, Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.
1, Well Played Kid's Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music
0, Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor
1, well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are
0, Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.
1, Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned
1, These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says
1, Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war
1, Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush
1, Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before
1, You'll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped
1," Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of ""Lament"" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song ""Beuonos Aires"" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less."
1, EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.
0, Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams
1, A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up
0, A small leak
0, Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning
1, It's a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate
1, Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item
1, comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling
0, Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
1, Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!
1, Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable
0, Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm
0, It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated
0, Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins
1, Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento
0, WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING
0," Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"""
1, Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all
0, Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak
1, Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
1, Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student
1, Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in
1, Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town
1, Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.
1," Its better then a ""normal"" bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated"
0, Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
1, Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use
1, great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
0, Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence
0, Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009
1, The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself
1, Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick
1, Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself
1," Step's Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD ""Standing Room Only."" ""I'm So Glad"" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a ""must buy"" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco"
1, 200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways
1, DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
0, Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
1, good: It was good
0, Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since
0, No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
0, Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews
1, GREAT prodct: For those wondering
0, Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated
0, Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature
0, Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty
0, HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
1, Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say
1, After 6 years
0, I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein
1, Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
1," Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her ""dialouges"" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs"
0, Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok
0, misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also
0, Waste of money: If you get to this review
0, What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
0, Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day
0, Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly
1, Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
1, Romeo and Juliet
0, Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
1, A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story
0, RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things
0, Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos
0, How do films like this get made?: If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film
0, What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous
0, Cute
0, Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree
0, no color
1, Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But
0, Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy
0, A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball
0, MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say
0, Lies
0, REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau
1, I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter
0, sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit
0, Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended
0," Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However ""Hope"" is far too theatrical"
1, A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
1, A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings
1," One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever"
1, GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book
1, Great space heater!: It swivels
1," Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of ""Portrait of a Marriage"" years ago"
0, Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
0, This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However
0, Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog
1," a childhood favorite: In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital"
1, Forget Belkin
1, Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you
1, Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book
1, Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts
0, complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions
0, bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving
0, does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
0, Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
0, Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better
0, Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use
1, Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store
1, Top Notch Christmas Jazz: I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard
0, review: The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy
0, Wow: I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning
1, Basketball
0, never again: I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on
0, Reaching for the Light: I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
0, Hardly worth reading: This book
1, Statin levels: Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins
0," DECEPCIONADO: Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil"
0, Excellent show
1, Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow): Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work
0, It does not use your classification for the musics.: I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover
0, Returned the View twice in one week: I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles
0, Worst mp3 player on the market.: I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please
1, Nice Device: This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 
1, This player is very very good: Wow
0, Don't buy without a good return policy.: This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
0, Don't buy this piece of crap: I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So
0," Nothing is from scratch?: Why on Earth would ""nothing is made from scratch"" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good"
1, Really funny and exciting: I'd say this book is extremely informative for the responsible
1, Good book: Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
1, Great History: I am a big fan of Ms. Blake's but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you're a fan of people and their cultures
1, Handy card holders: I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards
0, It does the job: If you can't hold the cards
1, Buy this now!: Very attractive
1, Forward the Mage an Alternate Style: Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais
1, Fantasy writing at its best: Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer
0, A device grows old: Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap
1, Cool Documentary: I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don't let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states
0, Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships: This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships
0, Jabra Eargels: The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
0, Jabra Ear Gels: These are not the same that come on the earbud
0, What a waste: Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something
1, Fast delivery
0, JABRA EAR GELS: Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
1, jabra eargels: These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
0, Don't waste your money: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone
0, Not well suited for the Jawbone II: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II
0, pain in the ear: They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically
1, JEG: The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
0, scottiesgems: I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
0, Don't waste your money: After ordering these eargels
0, This movie is not all that: originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star
0, Hmmmmmmm: I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well
0, Crap
1, The Odyssey with Armand Asanti: I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
0, Great movie
0, Very BORING: This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age
1, Birds
0, I Don't Think So!: Quite often
0, The white whale isn't: The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic & you can't do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.
0, Did not fit in ear: I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear
1, Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable
1, The Face of a Stranger: Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series
0, Waste of time and money: I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture
0, This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.: When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows
0, I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...: I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms
0, very much disappointed: It was just terrible for me
1, A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!: A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure
0, Terrible movie: I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it
0, Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....: What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy
0, under the Tuscany Sun: Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new
1, Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!: In this movie
0, Diane Lane is great but skip this movie: Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.
1," Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS: I think it's always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a ""replacement substitute"". The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours."
0, Here's what really happened...: The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version
0," A failure of ""Battlefield Earth"" proportions!: I should say"
0, TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!: This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible
0, Horrible.: I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
0, ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.: I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad
0, Junk
1, I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!: I ordered this
1, concisely written: This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
0, What the????: It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing
0, When Good Products Go Bad: I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that
0, Very disappointed: Although these sheets are pretty and warm
1, Very large: These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However
0, dont get it: Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
0, Not a good toy: This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
1," JBL MRX512M: JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new ""opened"" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product."
0, Good for downhill only: I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled
1, Pratchetts Best!!!!: Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works
1, Pratchett Review Haiku: I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
0, Why do people like this garbage?: Okay
0, Boring plot.: I liked what it was about
0, cross contamination: The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches
1, Just Accepting Gluten Free Life: I have read the other reviews of this book
0, Terrible!: My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately
0, get the facts: Most of the people who gave shining
1, Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !: What a wonderful
0, Not useful and a waste of money: The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
0," Devoid of depth or even much substance: The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability"
0, Try something else.: I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much
1, Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.: Charles Dickens
0, Less than one star.: Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him
0, Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game: I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET
1, Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise: A regular nail biter: strong plotlines
1, A Must Have: For those familiar with the Burzum name
1, Super Reader: An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos
0, Politics?: A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument
1, A Must for Handgunners - Old and New: This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No
0, Lousy Camera: This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree
0, Piece of junk: Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
1, Video too!: I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
1," Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the ""best"" of Motown"
1, Great true crime read: I really have to give this author credit
0, static central: Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices
0, I expected something better: EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors
0, Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC)
0, Freud is crazy!: I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks
1, If life is a dream
1, It arriived: Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
1," Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words"
1, When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?: Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I
0, Amazon.com sent wrong size: Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
1, One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly
1, Janet
1, Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am)
1, Captivating: Very simply
1, Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.: Yes
1, Great Information: My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
1, Good Overview and Very Informative: I really enjoyed this DVD
1, Superb!: When I was 5 months pregnant
1, Chilbirth Education Video: Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
0, TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart
1, GO FOR IT!: This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman
1, LOVED this video!: After I bought this DVD
1, RECOMMEND!: I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do
0, Couldn't finish watching: Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes
1, very informative: Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information
1, Poignant & Intelligent -- give this one a listen!: Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable
1, Exquisitely fresh
0, At least it's free: I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free
1, Yardbirds: Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story
1, One of my favorites...: ...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe
1, Nice French farce
1, Daniel Auteuil is fabulous: I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
0, This book is AWEFUL: I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story
1, Captivating and Engrossing: When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong
1," Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!: I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars"
1, one of the best series EVER!!!: When my dad first gave me this book to read
0, Giants Mats: The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
1, Exactly what I ordered: Product arrived on time
1, Touching: Beautiful film
1, One of the best foreign language films: For once
1, Wonderfully emotional.: Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
0, The remix is different: I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster
0, Why the remix?: If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10
0, Art and Passion...but no Science: A series of short vignettes about fencing
0, No illustrations: The Kindle version has no illustrations
0, No drawings!: I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book
1, what hard rock is all about: Cut the crap! it's motorhead
1, Thuvia maid of mars: Typical ERB Mars series
0, Old-School Bore Metal: This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal
0, Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients: If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that
1, A new beginning...: This was their first true recording project
0, Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item: Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners
0, It's an ad.: This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber's school/store in CakeEater
1, A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it: A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author
0, Flyboys: Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless
1," World War I aviation visited: I have enjoyed watching ""Flyboys"" several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end. I noticed that one of the people interviewed was from Colorado and as a result I went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie.I find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it."
1, fly boys: i haven't watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review
0, Sappy and Stupid: This is a very bad movie. Bad music
1," This CD Rulez: I think that this is one of the best CD's ever. I really like the song ""Gravity"" and ""Next Time"". Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must."
1," ""Souless Pop?"" Not here: When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the ""lou pearlman"" sound to it. (remember o-town??"" This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don't need anyone- 3Feelin' You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*"
1, Thank God: I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables
0, getting tired of the cliche: Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy
0, shameful ripoff: even in the hour plus ''build-up/charactor developement''.i guess talky
0, Great movie
0, How STUPED can you GET!: I'll tell you how stuped you can get
1, Mighty Ducks rulz: This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!
0," What's this?...: When i first heard his single ""One Wish"" i thought this is a good tune"
0, raydiation: Thank God he stopped rapping
1, WELL DONE RAY J.: This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album
1, Stew: Well I am.... I have to say in all honesty.... A true Magnum fan
0, don't waste your money: I love historical novels
1, Brilliant reinvention: Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol
0, Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT: This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is
0, Too bad it's boring: The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters
1, carnivale: Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky
0, Once again
0, Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb: After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb
0, Don't bother!: This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest
0," This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...: ...it's about being ""proud of being the first Danish woman to do so"" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady"
1, Best Show Around: Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???)
1, cj: It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.
1, This is a great game for rookies
0, From the biggest CULT of all!: So someone from the biggest CULT of all
0, Pro?! Huh?: Not detail in explaining conceptsToo few numerical examplesContent far too simple to be a desktop ref. in the dealing rm.Poor editing and formatting90% similar to the earlier edition.
1, Good
0, I gave it a try...: Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can't think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you'll ever hear... can't say it's not original
0, Does not work on Windows XP!: Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center
1, if you love cats
0, terrible: Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn't advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.
1," ""Hope"" may be a wrong concept.: I wonder"
1," A timeless classic that's an unforgettable must-read.: This is the timeless classic which the term ""Orwellian"" and""Big Brother"" are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government ""Big Brother"" holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell's vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen"
1, 1984: Orwell's futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence
0, 1984: 1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don't really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one
0, Not a helpful history book AT ALL: I was doing a research paper on the year 1984
1, TEACHERS??: I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son
1, If you haven't read it
1, Scary!: George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too
1, disturbing and relevant: I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant
1, The greatest work of the 20th Century: What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read
1, Orwel Rolls in His Grave: This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda
1, A Thoughtful Read: Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual
1, The title should be revised to say 2004!: With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI
0, George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked
1, two plus two makes FOUR!!!!: George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought
1, A Very Interesting Read: At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read
1, Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.: I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back
0, Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...: OK
0, 1984: I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up
1, masterpiece: I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course
1, 1984 as true today as in 1948: For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future
1, I thought the book was great.: I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.
1, When Already?: Like others here
0, Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.: I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air
0, :\: If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries
1, Like silky
0, He isn't what I remember.: The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD 
0, Need to proof read your work: This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.
0, NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER: hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip
0, Waste of money: I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk
1, It is what is......: West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be
1, Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne's Best!: Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works
1, Wonderful story coupled with steamy
0, Stick with Sleeping Beauty: Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge
0, Vile from the beginning: Let me start by saying that I never put down a book
0, spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.: shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin
1, Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space: Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13
0, I HATE THIS BOOK: I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!
0, Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?: If it is
0, NOT THAT GOOD: Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.
1, Start memorizing this book.: I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple
1, dystopian classic: Wow
1," really good: this was a good book. the part called ""coca""is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like ""the giver"" only a lot better."
1, What a classic: To be perfectly honest
0, Didn't Like it!!: Confusing
1, A book with many levels: What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books
1, Fahrenheit 451: I read this book as a teenager
0, Great Book to read
0, DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!: This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow
0, Hardly even deserves 1 star: This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version
1, Captivating language
1, Ok: I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.
1, Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!: I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class
1," Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving"
1, It'll never go out of date: I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago
0, Bleak
0, Fahrenheit 451
0, Sadly a disappointment: Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended
1, F 451 shows how dangerous a person's ideas are.: I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general
1, A must read - especially for teenagers.: This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter
0, poor reading: I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!
1," Good: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world"
1, Explains a lot of things from the movie: The book was not so good as the movie
0, Fahrenheit 451: This book is pretty good
0, Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book
0, BURN THIS BOOK!: Hey A reader from MISSOURI
0, A Very Dark and Mysterious Book: I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally
0, I tried reading this book for my summer reading & it was bad: I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student. If you have a choice I wouldn't pick this one.
0, WASTE OF MY TIME: first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on
0, This is the lamest book I have ever read: This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do
0, Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV
1, real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound
1, INTERESTING AND SAD! 
1, motorola phone car charger: product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient
1, It worked: Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you'll never miss. It's big and bright.
1, Well made product at fair price: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.
0, Not so good: It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places
0, battle weary: This game is horrible. The battles are so... long
1, chalinging game: this game is hard and I still havn't beaten it
0, Horrible Game: This game is boring. You can't follow the story line
0, why oh why does anyone play this: Yes this has good graphics
1, The Code of Dusty Fog: I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites
0, Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz: I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong
1, I Kept Waking Up My Husband......: I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.
1, High Quality For a Reasonable Price: I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions
0, Hallmark of the disposable society?: Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So
0, NO AVAILABILITY: My rating is for Amazon
0, poor quality DVD recording: movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but grainy.I guess you get what you pay for.
1, Interesting View Into British Culture: As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
1, Colin Firth...need one say more?: Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate
1, Ones to watch over and over: Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.
0, Sweet Revenge: This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn't watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.
0, Not worth the great price: Paying about $16 for this collection of 8 films could have been a great buy. I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite
0, Warning. I HIGHLY don't recommend this set!: You would have NO idea reading the description
1, Great card
1, Great card but difficult to setup: As the other reviews noted
0," same: Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"""
1, Louie's Goose: A good childrens' book
0, Trite story line with poor recipes: I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite
0, an unusual writing technique: Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus
0," self indulgent tripe: ""What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth""If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel"
0, My farts make more sense than Finnegans Wake: ye make a book
0," Naked Emperors: Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such ""intellectuals"" are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip."
0, Mad with Vanity: That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW
0, He's challenging us to doodle...: I give this book two stars because it's the first
1, Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!: Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity
1, Pocket chart: It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
1, Sraight-up raw emotions...: From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw
0, I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.: It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit
1, Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.: Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics
0," Worse than ""The Quest"": The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins"
1, I liked it
0, Imitation Brand: They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti
0, Not good for small dogs like lhasas: This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures
1, The Wild Thornberry's Movie: This game is so cool. I have only played it once
0, Disappointed: I am sure the story is fine
0, stargate continuum: the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought
1, stargat continuam review by cvf: movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough
1, Very pleased!: As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors
1, 2/3 done: I am pretty happy with installment 2 out of the 3 that were promised. I have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars
1, It's great to have SGC Back: I hope we'll see more of this mini movies
1, Above expectation: The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.
1, Video Review: Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews
0, Great movie butt o grainy on blueray: I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it's another great stargate film.
0, one time cooker: This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
0, The few standout tracks on this album are...: 1) The intro
0, Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!: I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn't there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player
1, This cd is really cool..give him a break: I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild
1, Jusbeautiful: At first I didn't really care for this album
0, ultimately ineffective: This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn't talented enough to pull off what she's set out to do. Sad
1, Run Lola Run: This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so
1, What if!: This IS your bag:If you like action
1, My favorite movie ever: this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film
0, A bit overrated. . .: Actually this isn't really even a movie
1, Achtung!: This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn't enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn't the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it's over
1, Good for Hip and Knee joints in my Bichons: This product is palatable and seems to work well with my Bichon
1, RELLY CHALINGING.: RELLY QUICK action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern.batell is a chalinging game you fite. you can race to.
0, Just another excuse to make money: I am sorry but after reading this book
1, 10 stars!: This album is brilliant! If you buy it
0, Disappointing: This was a very disappointing purchase. The 'Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest' appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice
1, Thank goodness for Amazon!: My cable was out
1, Joshua & Children: This is an easy reading
1, Nice CD
1, Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique: I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern
1, McDuffie's elegance and artistry are marvelous.: I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD
1, Great value
0, Not a horror movie
0, Absolute Crap!: Okay
0," A Truley Horrible Horror Film: A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum"
0, Too awful to be funny: I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad
0," Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!: Is ""The House On Haunted Hill"" so different than ""The Haunting""? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors"
1, Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick: If you like super-natural mysteries
0, ...and what a feeble haunting it is!: No
0, Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS
0, Poor plot: The actors in the movie are a great bunch
0, Catherine Zeta-Hipboots: A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation
0, Typical Hollywood pulp: Third grade mentality
0, EMBARASSINGLY BAD: This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!
0, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN
0, Sadly Disappointing: This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title
0, It may be a modern-day classic to some
0, Poor re-make of a good movie: I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie
1, A lot better than the factory seat.: The seat was a cinch to install. It took about 10 minutes tops
1, Great story: I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago. I was so happy to have it to download and read again on my Kindle!
1, Please the parents and the kids: Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart
0, too small for a newborn: I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
1, book review: Book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it. Great that it comes with a CD.
1, A great buy: This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!
1, helped a bit: studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab
1," A Surprising Find: The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an ""American music"" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review"
1, 5 for the 1st
1, Make sure you see Jean de Florette first: This is the second part of a two part series
0, Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam: I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC
0, Will Die
1, My favorite book of all-time: I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me
1, Simply Superb.: I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical
1, This Book Changed My Life: Before reading this book
1, Macondo
0, Too Boring to Continue: I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters
0, Columbian family values: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family
0, 500 pages of boredom: The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately
1, my #1 book: this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot
0, You must read this book!: This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.
0, Emporer's new clothes.: I'm one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I'd experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn't get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation
1, U will never read anything like it: I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years
1, One of the best ever.....: I have read this book 4 times
1, A Haunting and Incredible Experience: I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish
0, lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book
0, Could never read this book....: This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English
1, Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece: This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration
1, great card: This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great
1, The best discworld novel; for beginners or veterans: I've read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)
1, Pratchett I just love him: the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories
0, I'll second that: I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs.
1, Carrot
0, Terrible product
1, Where are the other seasons?: This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date
0, Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable: I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books
0, Beware of editions by General Books LLC: Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material
0, Kindle version is very poorly edited: The content - introductory notes
0, Aaarrrggghhh: Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon
1, Cnnterbury Tales(Oxford Word's Classics): This translation allows you to read the stories
0, Great movie
0, Tedious and Self-Inflating: I'm always up for another look at the Titanic
1, This is GOLD!: Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order
1, Excellent fiddle: I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes
0, This Coyote Is No Genius: The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches
1," Good movie + these Coyotes aren't ugly!: This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the ""unrated version."" In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It's definitely a cutesy movie"
0, The bar scenes were cool
0," Coyote Stupid: This movie is so dumb... ""HOW DUMB IS IT?"" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb"
0," Absolutely horrible!: This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable"
1, Great Movie: I love this movie
1, Stunning: I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God's hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson's rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd
1, A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.: this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting
1, Rocks. Best. Get it.: Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also
1, GREAT: Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
1, the album grows on me...: I bought Garbage's first album first and I thought the album was great
1," Shirley...yum: Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track ""Temptation Waits"" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track ""I Think I'm Paranoid"" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for"
1, Shirley & The Boys Do It Again: Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album
1, Great show: Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show
1, GREAT: AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW
1, absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie: Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.
1, Julia: If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching
1, Review of JULIA: DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...
0, Glich Heaven: I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell
1, Wonderful flow: What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer
0, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !: There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer
0," Another Bogus ""How to be a better surfer DVD."": This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga"
0, dont do it: If you know anything about yoga
0, no book key: I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA
0, Needs some modification: This thing is ok. But realize
1, Nigerians! An Industrious People: When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children
0, If you love the songs on Noddy
1, Nice Experience.: This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on
1, A rebuttal ...: ... to Jazzie of Hampstead
1," Native American Herbal Remedies: So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to ""flip through the book"" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer."
0, blleeuurrgghhhh: i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs
1, Dad is in Trouble: This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.
1, can't stand those male co-stars: I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!
0, bad acting: This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney
1, Switching Goals - a very good movie: Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie
0, Entertaining
0, Will bore you to death: Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
1, A good book: I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.
0, Not happy: I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????
1, Nice suit.: It is a great suit
0, Worst test prep book I have ever used.: As other reviewers have suggested
0, preliminary review: I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book
1, Wild Wild West: This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
0, Isn't there a larger version of this game??: This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus
0, Disappointed: My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However
0, It's great when it works: I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well
1, the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert: yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert
1," Goodfun: Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or ""No! You go on without me ..."". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory"
0, Borinmg & dumb: A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world
1, Best film of the year: One of the best films ever made
1," See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!: ""Gods and Monsters"" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb"
1, best screenplays have more stability: One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay
0, Tree arrived bent and poorly packed: The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed
1, A Legendary story by Robert Creamer: Of the 200+ baseball books I've read
1, A Great Book on a Sports Legend: This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall
1, This will make your install a breeze. . .: My car is a 1994 Honda Civic EX. Save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo. Plug and play.
1, Great summer read: This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer
1, Gripping Novel About the Loss of a Child: The novel is a wrenching page-turner about a woman's loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live. The author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead woman's friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved. It is the best book I have read all year!
0, If I could rate it 0 stars
1, Helpful Start: Good book to start with; motivated me to get more books to read more about the nuances and subtleties about the game.
0, Sooo dissapointed: I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future
0, Material too flimsy: I bought this bed recently for my 9 year old lab mix. He doesn't dig
0, Disappointed: I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However
0, Looks & feels like a bootleg product.: My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby
1, Underappreciated Effort: While even some members of the Bonzos give this album low marks
1, Awesome!: I Love this. My kids have so much fun with these. They are strong and hold up to ruff play. They shoot water clear accross the pool.
0, A look at a distant past: I found it interesting. It will be used in an adult ed. class. I will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems
1, Excellent Translation!: If you follow my reviews
1, One of Clftons great ones: I love all of Clifton Webb films
0, PURE JUNK: SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER
0, Poor example. The homework problems like hell: The examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems. Never explain how to do bode plot at all. I am glad I know how to do differential equations before taking the class
0," Misleading title: A book with a heavily religious slant. Anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that ""God has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires""."
0, Propaganda: As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health
1, Excellent information: This book was suggested to me by a counselor I was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction. We both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction. There is so much information in this book and I would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
0, Great Concert - Bad DVD: I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.
1, Great deal on a fine subwoofer: I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room
0, This Book is NOT for NXT: It's a great book. But the Mindstorms microproessor is now NXT -- it has been updated. Until this book is updated
1, Practical Guide When Making This Challenging Decision: No one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there! This book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there. Much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough. When you study all of these essays together they are sincere
1, Excelente: Tego es la fuerza en la musica latina. Es una tremenda mezcla de son
1, definitely the best horror\suspense book I know: Since you open the book you cannot close it
1, why?: This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening
1, chuck: This a good movie in the same vain as most of Chuck Norris's films
1, Memory Lane: I saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the 70's and I recommended it to my daughter. When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player)
1, Love these little smoker bisquettes.: I love the Bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses. It is so easy to use. We've used the mesquite and pork and chicken. It's all turned out great.
1, the best kept secret anti aging creams on the planet: Have been using Exuviance products for many years they are the best. Its too bad they are not widely known. Everyone would look a lot younger!!! Exuviance should be advertising their products.
0, Doesn't fit my situation.: My fault. I received it OK but it just doesn't work on my water heater. I must not have checked it enough. It was a bad impulse buy for me.
1, One of the Best Romances I have Read: This is the first book from Candice Porter I have read and I cannot wait to begin reading her other novels. From the minute I read the first page
1, Underrated album: I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others
1, lo mejor del cine español: esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone
0, Well made but extremely skewed: This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them
1," Well worth watching: The Space Race wasn't quite as one sided as one might believe. This series outlines the benefits of Capitalism over Communism but also shows serious flaws in NASA work to ""get man to the moon before this decade is out""."
0," Not one of Rinaldi's ""masterpiecies"""
0, This was not one of her best books
1," An Aquaintance With Darkness: This book was an absolute joy to read. It immersed you into the characters. You felt totally attached to them. It let me in to a new aspect of the Civil War that I had never seen before...it was interesting and definitely not boring. This book is what I call a ""people-y"" book. She forms the characters so that they seem like real people"
1, Excellent!: This was the first book I had read by Ann Rinaldi and I loved it! I have read many other books by her since then. At first I thought I would not like this book because it takes place over 100 years ago
0," A story based on a song: As soon as I had read the first few sentences of the review I immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by Loreena McKennitt called ""The Highway Man"""

1, Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.: My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded
1, Do your homework: This product works great
0, Una porqueria no compre: Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse
1, Math made easy: This product was just how I remembered it when I used it 30 years ago. Yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard. But that is how it was 30 years ago and I did not expect anything different. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtraction.My children look at it like a computer and love playing with it. It gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
0, Average Book: The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
0, Some one has an EGO problem.: I previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book. And I was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me

1, practical guide to modern christian living: in this book
1, Best Unknown Artist: What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation
0, Not as good as the other album!: I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However

1, Marlon Brando: A good
0," Horrible!: Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However"
1, Well made
0, Useless: The DVD will not play. It goes thru the process of downloading until the last point & then says that it is not programed for downloading. I would like to send it back for a DVD that will play.
1, Another great book in the series: I really love this book just as much as the two before it. I just don't want the series to end because I'm enjoying it so much.
1, The single creepiest film of the year !!!: At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated
0, VERY BAD MOVIE: This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk
0, Awful Waste of Money!: This tape should be sold as an audio only. The cave scenes are so dark
0, movie was a waste of money: this movie totally sucks. i only spent 13 dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money. the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened. the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole. thats it
0, trash
0, over rated: had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!

1," Creepy old Anthony Hopkins film: Magic stars Anthony Hopkins long before Silence of the Lambs. His character ""Corky"" is a magician who can't seem to catch a break. He decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success. His ventriloquist partner ""Fats"" starts to take over Corky's thoughts and motives. The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me. Just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing. Great movie!"
0," harassing bears?: Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer"
1, THE best book for AP spanish!: This book is the absolute best buy for AP Spanish Language preparation. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam (although I thought that they had a little more then what was needed). The practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test. Having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher

0, Great printer
0, 1020 printer stopped working after few months: I can't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months. I bought it last Dec
1, Excellent Entry Level Laser Printer: If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
1, Great Read - Suspenseful: When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down
1, classic: hardly ever see this movie on tv..so i had to order..love it a must see!! went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kid...never forgotten it!!
0, WHAT!!!: Don't buy it. If Meth's new album isn't at least ten times better than this
1, A classic!: Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious'

1, Mr. Coffee Warmer: The warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk. The warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off. I could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
0, Mr Coffee mug warmer: I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
0, Warm
1, Very nice product: I have been using this product for a few weeks. I have a ceramic tea pot that I use to make a few cups of tea at a time
0, Doesn't keep coffee warm: Purchased this in 2010. Doesn't keep coffee warm. Well
0, Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer: The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer truely is a mug warmer. I use it daily. My mug is warm
1, Good heat
1," Works pretty well for regular sized mugs: The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks ""city"" mugs"
1, Works Well Keeping Coffee Warm: This works well to keep your coffee warm longer. It doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee.
1, Awesome!!!!: I'm a huge tea drinker & I enjoy drinking coffee. But with my work
0, Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer / Disappointed: It does not keep coffee very warm.I can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomfort.Hope that paints the picture you need.
0, Worthless Piece of Crap!: This thing needs a High Med Low setting cause the only setting it has is Low. I made a cup of really nice organic Japanese Shade grown tea ($40 an ounce) and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for 10 minutes. The pad gets pretty hot
0, Not happy with this one!: I have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product. I tried pre-heating it and still no results. Very disappointed. I positively don't recommend this product.
0, Doesn't keep coffee hot: Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.
0, Disappointed: I am very disappointed in the Mr. coffee cup warmer. My coffee is really hot when I first put it on however on theMr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm. I can't stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion. Don't waste your money. Why can't they make a good coffee cup warmer? I am still looking
0, disappointment: I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more
0, What a rip off!: Three criticisms:1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.2. $3.00 for ten minutes!3. Cheesy coloration.
1, westmoreland glassware review: Great history of the company
0, DISAPPOINTING: This is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points
0, Not what you think.........: If you read above
0, truly boring: This book was a waste of my time - I bought the bundle and now I'm not going to bother reading any more of Ms Cruise's ghastly stories. The dialogue was atrocious (and not at all amusing)
1, Highly Recommended...: This is an Awesome CD done by Derryl Perry
0, Holes drilled incorrectly: Aside from missing a few bolts I also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly. I will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem. This is as far as I have gotten in the assembly as I have ran out of daylight. I am sure when it is finally together it will be a 3/5 bench as opposed to my current 2/5 rating. The shipping went well as It got here on time.
0, Stats Class Workbook: The workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course. VERY UNHAPPY. I wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software
0, Too bad Galbraith isn't much of an economist.: Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers
0, smallville season 9-amazon (beware of DVD wrong region number): Please beware that this DVD that I purchased for use in the UK is the wrong region number. It was sold to me who live currently in the UK but it only works in region 1 DVD players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it I need to change settings of my DVD player but it has to be watched at once because I won't be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that. The return policy should cover this type of problem and refund 100% in those cases. It was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the UK which was really not a good sign. All customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying for.I am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
1, justice league done right finally: smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
1, Smallville Season 9 Rocks!!!: There are some folks who dislike season 9
1, smallville so far: i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc 2 many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood
0, smallville season 9: needs to be better packaged. it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
1, mesmerizing marlene: If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film
1, Why in the world did they choose full screen ?: This is one of my favorite movies. I own the Lasedisc on widescreen. I could not wait for the DVD. I can't understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only. What a shame!
0, Pan and Scan? No thanks!: Rats. I was all ready to buy this movie
0, Blu ray wouldn't play: I have a toshiba Blu ray player that's a year old and this Blu ray DVD would not play in my player because it's so new and apparently a 1 year old Blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs $40. So now I'm reluctant to buy Blu rays. I regret getting a Blu ray player at all now. I gave this DVD to a friend and I'm sure it's fine
1, Love this movie: Great movie
1, Good DVD: this DVD is a good show. it is good to see DVDs still widely availible. DVD is able to have true stereo

1, good diaper: These are good diapers that don't leak
1, Great diapers: Pampers and Huggies are
0, THEY LEAK - Use SWADDLERS!!!: Pampers Baby Dry is a huge misnomer...they are terrible for urine intake! If your baby sleeps on their tummy through the night...YOU WILL WAKE UP WITH A WET BABY AND WET SHEETS/EVERYTHING!Use Pampers Swaddlers...at least until after size 3 as that is the largest size Swaddlers they make for some reason. You can thank me later. BABY DRY = WET BABY~~!!!
0, Leaks at the kid's belly: Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap)
1, best diapers ever!: Well!We never had any issues with pampers brand of diapers.We've tried all other brands (Cheaper & expensive ones) and nothing comes close to diapers.
1, Best Diapers Ever: From testing all kind of brands from every store possible Pampers Baby Dry is far most the best out there!
1, i loved this item: i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country 
1, Best for the price: Not as soft as Pampers Swaddler
1, Good price
0, Weren't So Great.: We didn't like these AT ALL. I am a big fan of swaddlers
0, New and Improved with Sagging Technology: It takes a lot for me to dislike a product
0, Stick with the Pampers Swaddlers!: My almost-5-month-old has never had any diaper other than a Pampers diaper on his body! I swear by Pampers!But
0, Horrible Diapers: I bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever! The smell of urine seeps through the diapers. Also
1, Best for the Price: There are less expensive diapers out there
0, no: We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
0," ""Baby Dry"" but Covered with Poop: After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers"
0, Quality dropped in the last 6 months: I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency
0, Worst Ever!!: these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
0, There is a reason for cheaper price: Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter
1, The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!: These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
1, the best but only this time: pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
1, Swaddlers are better
1, Keeps baby dry and no diaper rash!: I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well
0, Not as good as Huggies Snug & Dry: When my son wheres Pampers
1, Best fit for my baby: This product is wonderful !! and the best fit for our baby. We tried Swaddlers because of a friend's recommendation
0, Fall Apart: I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking
0, Leaky and expensive: These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.
1, best for the $$$: these do a very
0, Incomplete Shipment: The diapers were fine except my order was for 124 diapers and I only received 112. I also didn't have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
0," Buy swaddlers not BABY DRY: We got a big box of ""baby dry"" from amazon. Our experience is that my son's clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid. On the other hand"
1," Great diapers!: We have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer Pampers for our son. They fit him best and we very rarely have ""explosions."" This box is a great value."
0, horrible diapers ever: Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!
1, Maybe this will help...: A lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate -- the size of the 1-2s are the same as the 1s
1, These are great diapers!: I have been using Pampers Baby-Dry diapers since Zach was only a few weeks old. These are the only diapers I will use on him. They are soft and comfortable for him. I can't say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper
0, No Good: The diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything. We found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour. Interestingly
0, Baby Dry = Leaks!: We tried Pampers Baby Dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day! Our one year old baby is a size 3 and doesn't have any problems in swaddlers
0, Pampers Baby Dry - not recommended: I purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the Pampers Swaddlers. I was wrong. I just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not. My baby girl is 6 months and is an average baby...not chunky or big (other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper)Here are my con's:-do not absorb like I need them to. She is up one to two times per night and if I don't change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and I will have to wash everything.-they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers.- when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her..it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs.yuck.They really are fine during the day
1, Gr8 Product: My kid is enjoying 
0, Not dependable: We found this diaper undependable. Leaky and can't take an average load (liquid or solid). Difficult to manage the night shift
1, Best value: I already have good luck with Pampers So far
1, Best Diapers: My little man sleeps 12-14 hours a night
0, Good: I like the price and quantity in the package but I'm noticing now that they are holding up overnight. I've recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
1, Good Diapers
0, Not as good as Cruisers: I normally buy Pampers Cruisers
1, Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack: I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
1, Best diapers for us: I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand
1, Best Diapers at a great price: I've looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers
0, Gave a rash: I bought the XL case of Pampers Baby dry in size 3 and after only 5 diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touches.My son's skin is not sensitive and we have used Pampers swaddlers
0, Not my favorite: We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
0, Terrible Smell and Horrible Rash: We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now
1, Great deal..: when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
1, Gr8 product & Gr8 deal from Amazon: Wonderful product at a great deal from Amazon.Babies will luv them.ALL stars. I am in for repeat orders for the Pampers diapers.
1, awesome! I save a lot of money: It is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one. I saved a lot of money and didn'y worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
1, Good diaper: This is the best diaper I have found next to the old Pampers Cruisers. They are not as soft as I'd like and they don't have a liner like I'd want
0, Pampers: These pampers were the worst
1, great: Loved this product for my baby. I have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
0, Not absorbant enough: I liked these the best when my baby was 16 lbs. but now at 20lbs he leaks through every one of them in 2 hours or less. The 4's fit a little too big and I know he's almost ready but these are supposed to be good to 28lbs and they are not. I have almost an entire case of these that I am donating because I don't trust them. Size 3 of Sam's Club brand is working WAY better than these and cost less too.

1, Great for the price!: I love these diapers. i have been using it for my son during the day. with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price. i think 50% discount is very good. its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
0, Not what the name implies!: My daughter was wearing the Huggies prior to this. I ordered this diapers

0, Rip Off: This edition DOES NOT contain a table of contents
0, A Mistake: A co-worker gave this book to me. He was more of a fan than I
0, Shameful: In my opinion
0," Did I watch the same movie???: Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused. Was it the same movie? The martial arts were ""ok"" in this"
0, .... HYBRID CD is a joke !!: ...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...

0, Does not adhere (peels off): So I tried this on a few things- attaching a leather strap to a suede bag I made
1, It Sticks!: The glue was easy to apply. My boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places ... Unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasn't one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay
1, Love this stuff: Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
1, Shoe Goo: Shoe Goo works great. The bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling. I applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry 24 hours. Next day the tennis shoe was good. Shoe Goo really works! For the size
1, Beginning with Audrey growing up during WWII brought integrity.: I learned a lot about Audrey Hepburn's childhood that I had never realized before. Beginning in WWII brought the story home and made it real.
1, What kind of person could have done this...: Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect
0, General Overview of Bizarre Cases
1, Fascinating Read: I don't typically read this kind of work
1, Why doesn't Clay get played anymore!!!: Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
1, My wife loves it: The stones are a bit small
0, POOR QUALITY: This is a very poor quality necklace. I needed to take it in direct light before I could see any stones
0, Really BAD: The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire. So I did return this item.
0, SKIPPING CD'S: MY CD OF CASSIE'S ME AND YOU SKIPS THROUGHOUT THE CD. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A CD FROM AMAZON THAT HAS SKIPPED. THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I ORDER ANY CD'S FROM AMAZON. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS I FEEL I'VE SPENT MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!

0, Not pleased: I am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons. First off this product did not teach me much of the Italian language
1, BibleMan a great Video: Absolutely wonderful video
0, There's a reason this was only on TV: The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand
1, excellent healthy eating book: Love the book
1, 11 x 14 Windsor Newton canvas pack: The item came in record time and in perfect condition. This was the second time that I have ordered this item and I will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
0, Received just one canvas: The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
1," Philip K. Dick would be proud!: This film is actually four short films... One film (The Robot Fixer) actually has little to do with technology or ""robotics"" as we usually perceive it (Lets play"
0, Defective Machine - Don't buy!: I was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe. At first
1, Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles: I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well
1, Supreme Coltrane: A wonderful and creative album. Great listening from start to finish. Belongs in every jazz library along with Blue Train
1, wow!: I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
1, Five stars?: There are not enough stars in the sky
1, Spirituality in sound supreme: A LOVE SUPREME was for John Coltrane
1, Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p: I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
0, Phone Cover: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was
1, Luck of the Irish: I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my wife who is Irish...she loves it....so do I and I'm not Irish.

0, Don't buy this book!: Only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser
0, Valeo WW2 2-lb wrist weights: I used the weights once. Well
0, Valeo wrist weights: The wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of 100 lbs or a child. I could not get them over my hand to my wrist. The advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
1, lite up: The bulb seems ok
0, I haven't received my items: It has been a month after the estimated date my items would have reached me and they haven't. Can you check on this???
1, Have fun with your baby!: I love this DVD! Get ready to have fun and interact with your baby. This DVD gives you so many ideas to have fun and interact with you baby by just using items you already have around your house. I loved the bright colors
0, Dissapointed: I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine
0, Buy a different guidebook: This guidebook is a waste of money - info is too scattered and does not address areas I will be visiting
0, Very disappointing: I liked the characters. He did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters. However the plot was awful. At the end I was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book. It's almost as though you're left wondering exactly what happened at the end.
0, Another spin on socializing costs/risks and privatizing profits: What else to expect from a Cato Institute publication? They support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
1, brill: this album is a must have. look for the similarities between sunny day and jane's addiction in 100 million - i swear it's there. every track is incredible - be warned that listening to it in already-sad states will lead to probably more sadness

0, Chekov's Play is like a Half-Eaten Apple...: Although Chekov's play accurately reflects the decline of Aristocratic power in 19th century Russia
0," Author needs to take grade school writing lessons: ""I didn't say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening"
1, Jane is a girl with spunk!: My daughter Sadie and I love this book. The author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl. This girl
1," One of the most disturbing ""war movies"" ever made.: Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema."
1, Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry: Thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition!
0, Swimming against the tide
0, Ho-hum: Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song
1," Amazing soundtrack: This soundtrack is truly a piece of art. Randy Newman has done some great things with this album. ""When She Loved Me"" is a beautiful song that I can't help but listen to over and over again. The instrumental part (which makes up the majority of the album) is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable. If you've seen the movie"
0, spirit of christmas: i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig. may try later. the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
1," The Bible Made Easy: This book takes each book of the Bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written. The author puts all the information in very understandable words. It does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place. It is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the Bible. It is more of a reference book than an ""easy read.""It is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others. Good for RCIA groups.Donna Murphy"
0, Absurd Plot: The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure
1, A fine read: Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain
1, Better than The Templar Legacy or The Amber Room: Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content
1, Very entertaining: This is the first of Steve Berry's books that I've read. I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
0, A few minutes of horror: There's about 15 minutes of horror film. But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting
1, A hair to the right

1, Changed my life: there have been others books similar to this one
0, Stale
1, THE Ultimate Food for your Lories: This is the only brand of Lory food our flock will accept. Its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
1, Do Fish Sleep: Full of very interesting info. which we probably never needed to know Bought for a 14 year old who really liked some of his previous books.
1, TiVo: Got this to have at my son's house when I visit. I love it! They love it too! Easily set up

0," If you liked getting scammed by Comcast's ""You don't have to do a thing when Digital arrives"" then you'll love the Series2: The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital. Now that Comcast has gone all-digital"
0, TiVo TCD49080 Series2: This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths

0, Good to see that fans are keeping the place clean: It's sad
0," *Thumbs Down*: This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough"
0, Judge a Book by Results: I purchased this book over a year and a half ago
1, The GUIDE for serious players.: Difficult to win anything on your own. $$$ outlay by individual players is too large. Better start a pool at the office with co-workers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems. You'll share winnings and losses (small and both sides unless you hit the Jackpot). No other book comes close. Get your rabbit's foot

0, Not for chevy s10 pickup: One bushing fits the other doesnt
0, Incorrect parts in package: I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
1, One of the Best Buffy Eps: Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos. It is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myself...all of the books are good too!

1, A good reference for basic techniques: I was looking for some more advanced features than were offered
0, Mixed Up: This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book
1, A True Romance - One of Garwood's Best: I absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. The heroine - Gillian - was full of courage and didn't back down when faced with problems. Laird Buchanen - the hero - is all man - but you can feel how much he cares for Gillian. At the same time - there are 3 or 4 other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of Gillian's main problem - will she get to see her sister? does she find the treasure? how will she get Alec to his home after he is kidnapped? who is the traitor to the Sinclairs? and more! I read this book in 2 sittings - and it left me feeling happy!
0, Killing your dog: In the chapter on Pets
1, Wonderful: This isn't just a history book laced with photos; this is also a personal view on the Cultural Revolution from the photographer's point of view. Informative and emotional at the same time. Wonderful.

0, ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS: For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella
1, This highly surprising telling....: ...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
1, Well-written
1," Give Tey a try.: Did Richard III have the princes in the Tower ""done in?"" That is one of the great mysteries of history"
1, Mystery for history buffs (or a history for mystery buffs): Josephine Tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history. Was Richard III the evil murderer of the princes -- or not?I think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery (two of my favorite areas) and reread it regularly. So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery

1, Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea: This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation
1, Inside the Whalers: Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other
1, great historical account of good and bad leadership: a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the Essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that. The failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mate's influence to sail east in the small whaleboats
1, What a wonderful Story: What a wonderful and often time touching story. It is very hard to believe what those men went thru. They were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured. I recommend this book to everyone. Especially those who think that they have is bad.
1, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.: The condition is somewhat less than perfect -- but not much.The book is wonderful. Fascinating story and Very well researched and written.
1, The sinking of the whale ship Essex: This book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period. Their adventure on the ship Essex as it left port sailing for new grounds . Little was know about the islands of the Pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives. Some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship mates.Their lives
1, How does this novel stack up with the Penguin Version?: I haven't read this book
1, An Exciting Tale of Survival: The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick

1, A sports world comedy sporting two wonderful stars: Hepburn and Tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent.

It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!
1," Wireless is the way to go!: This little gizmo works as promised. It's great if you want to transfer shows from one TV to another in your house. You can also download programs to your laptop providing you have TiVo to Go Plus. I'll never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane again.It took me a little time to figure out that in the ""setting up"" stage of connecting your adapter"
1, Works.: Easy installation. Tivo has a rating of reception
1, It works: This wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my Tivo. I had bought one at Radio Shack of a different brand and it did not work at all. But the TiVo Adapter was easy to plug in and set up. I have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now I don't need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modem/router.
1, Real Plug and Play: Plugged it in and my Series 2 DT popped up a config screen
1, It works: Not too much to say about this adapter. It does what it's supposed to. Sure an N adapter would be better but even the G is over priced.
1, Great product!: Easy to setup without having to read the manual (haha) and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems.
1, Works perfectly and a great price.: Short and sweet. Had it working flawlessly for 2 weeks now. No problems at all.
1, Great price and works perfect: I paid less and got the exact same Tivo wireless adapter as sold by Tivo. I have had no problems and now I get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables..
1, Tivo Wirelss G: Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time
1, Works with my Pioneer DVR-810H: I had purchased another wireless network adapter that wouldn't work for my DVR (approx. 4+ yrs old now). This TiVo adapter connected and works great. Saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through Amazon instead of TiVo directly...
0, Died 12/29/09 purchased 3/2007: I have 4 Tivo's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor. I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed. Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly. I giving two stars because it did not last very long. The other WiFi adaptors (Linksys and Microsoft) are still working and they are older. I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot
1, Great product and easy to use!: We unpacked this small module
1, I like Hardy
1, I liked this book.: At first
0, Dubious creation: There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit
1, Hard questions....Real Answers: This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion
0, Snooz-a-pa-looza: Total waste of celluloid
0, horrible!!!: I have to say that I am a pretty big Kurt fan. I was excited when this movie came out because I felt it might actually be pretty good. The only good thing I can say about this movie was that the actor looked semi-like Kurt
0, Worst.movie.ever.: Absolute worst movie that I have ever seen
0," What a waste!: Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched ""The Doors"" too many times. What a waste"
0, Dissapointed...: I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry
0, Difficult Read: This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled
0, An Insult to the English Language: I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class
0," Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.: The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7"
0, Great for Novices who want to stay that way: Elaine and Peter are career authors. They obviously don't use the products they write about
0, Expected more...: not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent
1, High Energy Performance: These women ROCK! This is a wonderful performance by 4 very talented string musicians. It is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing
1, Didn't quite live up to expectations
0, Useless for Home theatre or TV show.: This product is good for UK only. To play in USA you need to find a DVD player which has capability for changing Region Code to UK and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on DVD player in USA. I order it in USA
1, Wonderful Techniques!: I am now a devoted Jean Warren fan! 1-2-3 Math is great for the under 5 set! I have two children
1, Solid overall: Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach
1, Excellent Service: I order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase. It is excatly what I wanted and I got it in no time flat. I was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it..
1, Well made
0, used to be good: I have lots of these 
0, Wrong size: I have no idea how good or bad this item is. Amazon advertised size M for this item and I ordered it. When it came it was S. and I didn't know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size. When I looked it was a S. I had thrown all the papers away so I am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale I have or someone has.
1," Works as Advertised: No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention. Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your ""area"" may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear. Once you remember to do that"
0, Dumping it down the drain: This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy
0, Original poem not used
0, This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.: Not one of the stronger entries in the series
0, maya: I loved the cover when I saw it
1, A Lesson in Human Tragedy: This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short
0, Of Mice and Men! More like Manly Mice!: I found several critical problems with this play
1, Read this book!!: I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
1, A Simple Story That Says So Much: Short
1, Lexi A.W.
1, Of mice and men - Izzy G: Of mice and men was a great book. It told about how and little man named
1, Great piece of american literature.: I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream. All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
1, Review for Of Mice and Men: Of Mice an Men is a great novel. It sends you back in time to the Great Depression era of the 1930's. It is a good book for middle school students. The reason I gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book. Except for the language
1, Astonishing! A Masterpiece! Bravo!: By far
1," ""of mice and men "" by: Ruben from Tx: ""Of Mice and Men""In this story there are two very good friends"
0," don't read this book: When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch ""I'm not saying he's bright"
1, Of Mice and Men: My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact
1, Of Mice And Men: The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment. I expected the book to be about mice. I later found out it was really about. This book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake. George is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation. So the book takes place in a rural area in California. I t is a fiction book. It's a rally good book so you should check it out.
1, OF Mice and Men: A classic
1, Wow: This book is short
1, awesome!: this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and it's cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end........
0, dont read this book!: My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really
1, You must read this book!: Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George
1, Winning The Affiliate Game: Using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by. Thanks Declan for providing information that truly helps the average
0, Lukewarm at Best: I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan
0, Overrated: The funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it
1, Pretty good
0, save your money!: As an avid movie goer
1, Wonderful!! Watch it twice or you are missing out!: The first time I saw this movie in the theater
1," Another must-have-DVD from Sandler: I do love Adam Sandler and I thought him and Drew made a great pair in ""The Wedding Singer"" so I just had to watch this. I was not disappointed. It is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are well-written punch lines.Henry sees Lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him. Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.It turns out to be a charming"
0, Schizophrenic product: At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people
0, The First Fifty Sandler Movies...: ... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony
1, alot like life - funny & tragic: I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that
1, Fall in Love for the First Time Everyday!: The idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again. In this story it happens literally everyday.The performances:Adam Sandler as Henry Roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance.Drew Barrymore as Lucy Whitmore has never been better
0, perfume: This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
0," Stay Away From Passport - Large ""PIP"" Logo On Screen: Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large ""PIP"" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality"
1, Cookwear 4 qt. 3 piece: I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it
1, so did you read the DNA report?: it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place
1, I like it alot - from an non-latin: I first started listening to Azucar Moreno through a friend in New York a long time ago... This is exciting music
1," Topper is Tops!: ... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid"
0, No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!: I like baby dolls
1," Vanessa's Harmonium: A Work Of Art: Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking.""White House"""
1," Amazing CD!!!: This is by far a better CD than Vanessa's first. All I have to say is that this is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. ""Whos to Say"" has become one of my favorite songs. ""San Francisco"" is also an amazing song. Vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album."
1, Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton: Harmonium is such an incredible record
1, So much fun and versatile: My daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece
1, perfect: fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
0, BAD!! Don't buy IT: This item doesn't even look like the one the picture... It's not the real thing and it's a bootleg one..
1, A very informative book: I expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through. This book
1," Plenty of Emotion: I don't agree that Clay shows no emotion. One needs only to listen to ""The Way"""
1, Awesome: Listened to the CD three times and love it. Catchy tunes I caught myself humming throughout the day. Love ballads that I so moving. Great mix of songs. It sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today. A few tunes were almost Beatles sounding. Clean and refreshing!!! Clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it. Anyone who wants an enjoyble CD that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this CD. The CD just makes you feel good. Clay sounds great.
1, Hot! Hot! Hot!! This Man Is a Superstar In the Making!: I cannot describe the wonderful voice of this young man. Its so awesome
0," Why won't amazon post my review: I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
0, Yawn.....: Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough
0," schmalz: In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define ""schmalz"". Oh my god"
1, If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD: Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.
0, Talent without good songs.: It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However
0, california: I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good
1, He is the Measure of a man.: I love this man...and please don't get me started on his voice!I now can't ever imagine my life without having Clay Aiken in it! He's such a wonderful talent...not only with his beautiful
1, good but could be great: First
0, Measure of a Man's bad Material: Don't get me wrong
0, marketing machine-wolf wearing sheep skin: Ok people. I like POP music
0, Great voice
0, Great Singer
1, Changed my life: These recordings deeply affected me- even more so than the works of the Johnny Mathis.
1, 5 stars for the voice
1, CLAY FAN: CLAY AIKENS NEW CD IS WONDERFUL BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECITED HIS VOICE LIFT'S MY SPIRIT'S UP I AM A DIE HEART ELVIS FAN JUST WATING FOR SOME ONE TO LIKE AS MUCH I THINK I HAVE FOUND HIM
1," I Love It.: When I first listened to ""The Way"" I loved it instantly. It's the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time. It is very catchy and very romantic. I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry"
0," I'm sorry: I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was ""cute"". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion"
0, Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony.....: Ugh! From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover
1, Measure Of A Man CD Is The Best: Don't listen to that negative
1, The Real American Idol: This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks. A must have for all American Idol fans
1, Superb!: Clay Aiken's debut... I wasn't sure what to think
1, CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI: THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
0," Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!: Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
1, YAY: I fell in love with Clay's voice when he sang Open Arms on American Idol. It was so touching
1, EXCELLENT!!!!!! 5 stars plus!!!!: Excellent voice
1, Well Done: I haven't liked much recent American pop
1, amazing!: Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing
0, nothing out of the ordinary: This man really does have a great voice
0, When a good voice meets bad music: This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators
1, Listen to it again!: Being a 31-year old male
0, It hurts: It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
1," Eventually Measures Up ...: While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American ""Can Do"" philosophy"
1, Fresh Sound: Clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode! I think this new release is great in every aspect. I too would like to see Neil Sedaka produce him! That aside
0, Not a five star rating: I am very surprised at the 5 starspeople are giving this CD. Pleasedon't waste your money. Clay wasokay on AI2 but this new CD justshowcase his talents. Hopefullynext one will be better. I will haveto give this one two thumbs down!
0, Disappointed but still a fan.: Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it
0, Really bad :(: That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
0, Doesn't Measure Up!: This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice
0, Nice guy and great voice: but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
0," Not What I Expected!!: I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
1, CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST: I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out
0," Why I Hate Potato Chips: Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos"
1, Decent Tunes.: I'm not really into pop music. I really like rap and R&B
1, Clay is da bomb: This CD showcases Clay's talent beautifully!!! He sounds fantastic. I think his music will appeal to a wide range of people. I am very PROUD of Clay Aiken. He has stayed true to himself. Thats refreshing. Way to go Clay!!!
1, Amazing: This is an AMAZING CD! This mans voice is incredable. There is not one song that I dislike. I loved his performances on American Idol
1, It Is All About The Voice!!!!!: Clay Aiken's voice stands out more than any other singer I have listened to. It inspires
1, Measure Of A Man: I love
1," skydivergirl: LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have listened to this CD since it came out on 10/14/03---CLAY AIKEN has a magical voice that pulls you in. All the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are ""The Way"""
1, CLAY YOU HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT...I LOVED YOUR ALBUM !!!: I am extremely proud of you
0, Doesn't do it.: I've honestly heard this entire album
0, Yawner: My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD
1, Clay Shines: I wasn't sure how I would react to this CD. It's not the usual style of music I listen to
1, Let the Revolution Begin...: After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single
1, One of the best albums ever!: Since the moment I heard Clay on American Idol 2 I have loved his voice. This album shows just what this youg man can do
1, Excellent CD with catchy songs: This CD is one of very few that I own that I listen to the entire CD. I enjoy each song on the album
1, Award winner and very deserving of it: No wonder this man won an American Music Award
0, Not Thrilled: I watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on American Idol
0, This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!: Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music
0, If I could have given this CD a zero...: I'm not a hard person to please
0, Not worth Buying: This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
1, Clay should have won AI: Clay Aiken is the reason I enjoyed the second season of AI so much. His voice is so pure and strong. It's almost like listening to an angel sing. It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings
0, This album is not as good as they make it seem: Only Claymates like it and his fans are buying his way. Mr. Aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great
1, What a cutie!: When I think of Clay
1," THE MUSIC IS BACK !!: People who have appreciated Real Music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the ""Measure of a Man"" CD. The crystal clearness"
1," Great album: This is an album that I will listen to again and again. Wonderful songs sung by a great voice. ""Touch"""
1, Awesome-Again!: Clay
0, Whats going on??: I dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it. I dont know i dont have his cd and I'm not going to get it you can if you want to but I like things that are original
1, Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY: This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert
1, Blown Away!: This is truly the best CD that I have bought in a very long time. I followed Clay Aiken all through AI2
1, Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up: Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD
0, Big disappointment!!!: Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while
0, AWESOME!!!: I fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on AI. He is not only adorable he as a AWESOME voice!! girls are crazy over him!! and this CD is SOO GREAT!!IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVE CLAY SOO MUCH and if u say that you can't stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over him??JELOUSY!!! : )Keep it up claymates! he has already gone double platinum!!! WOOWOO!
0, clay is such a joke: he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him
1, Love It!: I just love this cd. After I got the cd I must have played it over and over for days. There is not a song that isn't great! Everything is sung with such heart! I think Clay Aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time. No gimmicks
1, The Best CD I Have Ever Heard: This CD sent chills down my spine. Clay Aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
0, Teen Titan Tower falls apart: This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star
0, OK Toy: I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter
1, Good stuff!: I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin
0, Not worth it: Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters
0, Car Parts (struts) for [] Java []...: This book is a complete waste of time. I had been very skeptical of the technology being only a short-cut for Java web hacks and script-kittys
0, non working battery: The watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead. I thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch. I wont order from this vendow again.
1, Don`t listen to the review...: This album jams! Yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno-pop JAM!
0, Works fine
0, Special Waste of Time: This movie is for you if -(a.) you are over 20 and still read comic books(b.) believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a superman(c.) then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwise(d.) find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselves(e.) and don't know that
1, Hystericly Funny: Thought this film was very funny
1," Better than I thought: I would consider myself a ""radio"" Damn Yankees fan"
0," Do not be deceived!: This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared"
1, creative action all over: this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior. he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil. he uses that knowlage to kill monsters. The book is a little confusing at times
1, Chaka's Powerhouse Vocals!: When this Lp came out in 1982
0, Huxley it ain't...: I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors
0, Through the Madness!!!: First of all
1, works!: I have been taking these for 6 months- I don't love taking 6 tabs a day
1," Even Creepier Than You Thought: What's most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison. Only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that ""these babies deserve to live."" Sadly"
1, BUEN PRODUCTO: Esta excelente el producto
0, Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman: If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary
1, Yancey has another one: I have read all Philip Yancey books & he gives an intellegent & amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the Bible. This provides a person the detailed readings therein
1, The Paradise War book: I was very pleased at how quickly I received my purchase. It was for a gift and I tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
0, Good show but TERRIBLE packaging: The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that
1, The Sanctuary: I like this show. But then again I like Sy-fi. Amanda Tapping is a good actress. Enjoyed her in StarGate SG1. And in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation..
0, Sanctuary Season 2.....Fail: After enjoying the first series of sanctuary I have recently purchased the second season
0, Temperature displayed is incorrect: The accuracy of this thermometer is really poor. I returned the thermometer for an exchange from Amazon. The replacement has same problem I did calibrate it
1, Olives
1, If you loved the First Outbreak
0, Boring!!!!!: The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed
1, I did it so anyone can...: I am a grandmother with no woodworking experience. I made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners. I looked for help on the net and found this book. Three days later I finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect! The directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them. I have more trouble making a souffle than I had working with crown moulding - thanks to this book. It should be in everyone do-it-yourselfers library. By the way
1, Good Book - Presumably in Either Edition: My daughter (almost 3) enjoyed this book from the library last Halloween & we're looking forward to reading it again this Halloween. I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors
0, The Worst of Kirk Whalum: Kirk Whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster!! It doesn't deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true Jazz lovers. Please do not judge Whalum by this CD. I'd recommend 'Unconditional' instead.
0, worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all: I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors
0, Horrible product: This shirt is absolutely the worst in the market. The fabric is cheap
1, Shirt in picture is not what they send you: First off
1, Good buy with reservations: Of course the list price is a joke. However
0, Very thin
0, Poor Quality: I bought this shirt for one reason
0, smack the editors: As mentioned by other reviewers
0, A clas-sick that made me sick: This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
0, Interesting but Repetative: While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on
1, Oldie but a goodie: I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book.
0, A disappointing read for the 21st century: This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s
1, Twenty Thousand Leagues: A mysterious creature is haunting the seas
0, Internet connection turns off all the time: After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then
0, A REAL MESS: SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
1, Awesome!: I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover
0, Yadda
1, LOL!: Good stuff - some funny
1, Narnia: Prince Caspian: It was a great choice between BD and DVD
0, Thanks for the case: I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
0, Very Disappointing: If you enjoyed the book
1," OMG: OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL"
0, Too Precious: Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe
1," Correction on May 16th Review: The software mentioned on my May 16th review IS called ""AVID Xpress"" -- not ""AVID Express"" -- when my review was edited someone changed the spelling"
1, Easy to follow: This is a quick reference or trainer. Use it to help Scouts with their knot requirements. Simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot.
1, Knot idiots
1, Very Cool: I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
1, Have not needed it yet: This is pretty cool. It shows you how to tie some basic knots that can Come come in handy in various situations. I got this so I can leave it in my go bag with 100ft of some paracord.
1, The Wind in the Willows: A beautiful book with detailed
1, inspiring: a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did
1, The recipes sound great.: I look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information. However the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as 1/8 of recipe. This is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup. The soup would have to be divided into 8 servings to get an accurate calorie count. Even with that drawback I know I will enjoy some of the dishes.
0, One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.: Factually shaky at many points
0, Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!: The more you know about mountaineering
1, The bittersweet summit: A must read for anyone preparing to climb. You will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant
0, I was disappointed: I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish. As a redhead
0, Was she serious?: Since I have a red-headed daughter
0, It's okay.....: I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair
1, Excellent Series
1, Robin of Sherwood: Picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered. Also Disk 2 had a glitch in it on the first play. Disk is clean. Over all quality is not great.
0, Misrepresented Product: The image shown is EXACTLY what you'll get; it isn't misrepresented on Amazon. The package is mis-leading. It clearly shows a 2.2 mm Hex-nut. It does not work on any glasses that have a hex-nut. In fact
1, Every kind of comedy styling all in one film...: What makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has. You see not only slapstick and situation based comedy
1, One of the best readings about stats!: This book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics
1," Outstanding book: Someone once said ""there are three kinds of liars: liars"
1," An Entertaining Primer on the Validity of Statistics: Although ""How to Lie with Statistics"" is a bit dated (having been written in the 1950's)"
1, Clear
1, An Up To Date Primer!: This book is a very good primer for getting one's feet wet in the world of non-profit organizations. While it is by no means exhaustive
0, sony printer: not really what i wanted xxxxv xxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx xxx x xxxxx xxxx zzzz zzzz zzzz
0, A waste of money -- and tin.: This collection amounts to three dollar-store discs jammed into a pretty package. For those who prefer substance over style
0, Misleading: You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection
0, Not what I expected - a rip off: The price was attractive
0," Total rip off: The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says ""7DVDs over 11 hours"" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class"
1, Good Read: i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it. I enjoyed it but will not read it again.
1, Quite possibly the scariest novel ever constructed: Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print.
1, chico hamilton timely: cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
1, I hate reductionists: As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But
1, skillful: Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent
0, we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate: Pinsky is in love with being a poet
1, Great!: I like em a lot
1," Great Resource for Victorious Living: This is a great resource for victorious living! It shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty! It is a quick read - I was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down! I got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the ""dating"" stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as God intended. I highly recommend this book - whether you're married or single!!"
0, Fine Film
1, Very nice: Item was just as described. Very nice fit...does not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon. I would definitely buy this again. Perfect
1, terrifically written
1, Great: This eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo 2-3 months. Way more economical to buy here on Amazon than in the store. We reseal it for storage
0, choco tacos: I have to say I haven't actually read this book
0, As a How-To Book
0, Horribly Disappointed!: Don't get me wrong
0, the long secret--: just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only.
1, Good for Smaller bows: This product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows. I have a Mathews Reezen and it was too small. Amazon has a great return policy and traded for Plano Max XT.
1," Presents a way of devotion to Jesus and Mary: This book presents a marian version of the traditional Greek orthodox Jesus prayer. Instead of ""Lord Jesus Christ"
0, YUCK!: I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it
1, A very REAL book: Leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over
1, Summer of my german solider review: I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing. I thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today. The author didn't pull any punches in this startling work. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
0, BORING: I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW
0, A Boring with a German Soldier: Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot
1, Good: This was a present for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It arrived in a very reasonable time. It seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
1, Little America: This book was an interesting reading for me. It was one of the best school readings I have been assigned. It was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past. His style of writing was upfront and direct. We did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed
0, Disappointing: Fine as an introduction to Duncan
0, Bad quality zipper: We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids
0, what i thought about this tent: i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in 3 places. and the zippers are terrible always get caught.its roomy but its cheap!
1, Amazon shipping: This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.
1, Good Anime: If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it
0, I'd rather stick razors into my mouth: Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks
1, Best band of all time: This Dvd is amazing. Braid is rock at its finest. If you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour. The extras are hands down the best on any live dvd I have seen. This knocked the Impossibles Never Say Goodbye Dvd out of my player finally.
1, well written and complete but a little dated: this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative. nevertheless
0, Smells Sweaty: I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use
0, Unsupported by the Constitution: Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent
0, Not for Hydroponic Growers: This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing
0, Evident Growing Errors!: Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower
1, Great find!!!!: This book was a great find! It has more information than pictures which is okay
0, still waiting: This book never shipped. ordered over 6 weeks ago. Smazon still says ships within 1-3 weeks. it has been 4 weeks past their estimated ship date. So don't bother ordering this book.
0, boring & pretentious crap!: This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead
0, Heavy going: It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator
1, DVD Version please!: I had this VHS tape years ago but no longer own it. I'm looking for the DVD version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable work-outs tapes I've ever done...and I've done a lot of them.
1, Very fun video and not hard to follow!: This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
1, Fabulous: For the first time
0, I like Elton but...: I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
0, crocodile crock: The king of Crocodile Rock lost his teeth 25 years ago but here he is -again! - plugging away in geezer FM heaven. While old pharts may love the way John's campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their Depends
0, not what i had hoped: i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie
1, Best Yoga video for kids of ALL ages & abilities: Totally fun and captivating with creativty for children 3-13 plus lots of stuff for older brothers/sisters as well as Mon/Dad or any extended family member to partake in. Great pace for ALL. Perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow mood.Everyone will be inspired to increase their mental/emotional calmness
0, Very slow shipping: The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
1, A Great Book: Once I started reading this book
1, The Greatest Generation: Excellent book with profiles of folks who survived WWII and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves. The format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
0, Great topic
0, A great disapointment: Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead
0, Mr.Brokaw concentrated too much on officers: Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview
1, Greatest Generation: A very moving and informative book. A friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed. After reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in WWII. This book helped me bring me closer to my father.This book is full of stories of WWII vets
1," Inspiring: I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the ""greatest"" or not"
0, A waste of time: Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation
0, Good idea
0, A book of simple hurra patriotism: I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me
0," 0.5 g of Trans Fat per serving: I bought some because it was advertised as ""A healthy snack choice..."" only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil."
0, VTech i6775 Review: Years ago
0," No. Just No.: looks cool. Key word people ""looks"" cool"
0, Tech Analysis is a bunch of BUNK: This book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
0, this is not the latest version of the book!: I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously
0, the paper back edition is a pirated
0, Reprint of a old-edition (1948 ?! ): The book is the reprint of a old edition date back 1948 with some little update up to 1963. The Amazon's Search-Inside(TM) refer to another update version of the book (9 ed.). The book's style and content is very old
0, NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!: Hello Champions
1, Body Movin': When you hear the term rap-rock these days
1, Humorous bathroom material: This is a great bathroom reader. I find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off
1, True Love: This is a very good CD. There is no song on this CD that I don't like
1, A significant book in psychology and the Bible: Johnson
1, big improvment: My Dell 2650 has 256mb of ram total. More then one program running and it would slow down sometimes freeze. I took out the two 128mb sticks and purchased two of these
0, Sounds not like yoga instructor... Really I apologise for my feedback.: The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal
0, not that good: all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey. I only like the first song. the rest....are all CHEEZY!
1, I loved the theme song
0," Boring Waste of Time!: I bought this CD in hopes that some of Destiny's Child's songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing. What I got was a horrible butchering of ""Emotion"
0, Fake blue Lights: These lights are not blue.I can't even tell that I've changed mine from stock bulbs.There is absolutely no difference here.They don't deserve one star.Absolutely do not buy these..It's a waste of time and money.CON
0, Do not waste your money.....: I'm a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning. In my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money. Yes
1, 60 minutes of encouragement and fun!: Our whole family loved this video. It is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family (both young and old alike)
1, A MUST SEE!!! QUITE HILARIOUS!!!!: I purchased this video for my son (who loves them) and fell in love with it. It is my favorite Veggie Tale to date. A must see!! It is quite hilarious especially the silly song with Larry.
0, NOT MUCH TO SMILE ABOUT HERE! 1 1/2 STARS!: I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person
0, This is a horrible
0, Died after 2 years: I read those positive reviews here and bought this item 2 years ago. It worked pretty well at the beginning. Starting from about a year ago
0, too slow!: We bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it
0, Quality of cooked rice went down after about 1.5 years: For the price
0, Broke in 10 months.: I was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore. They do not sell the part. Beware. It is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable. I had it for 10 months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice. The cost to repair it makes it useless because I would just have to repair it again in 10 months. This is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just won't last.
0, Just after 2.5 years
1, THE little appliance that will.....: All I can say is that every working
1, We love it!: I purchased this rice cooker as a Christmas gift for my parents. I was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My parents loved it - my mom has Alzheimer's so my dad does all the cooking. He has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals. Once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well. The cooker is very easy to clean! We are very happy with it. Ours is made in Japan
1, Best white fluffy rice I have ever had!: The rice turned out perfect! Very different from other rice cookers I have tried. I am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the LCD display though since I don't intend to plug the machine in all time.
1," great item: I was a little confused by reading reviews but I decided on the goFit ball at 65cm and it worked out just right for my 5'8"" frame. There was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provided.Did my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my 215 lbs of body weight.I would recommend this item."
1, Like it: As other reviews
0, Way too soft: It is possible I got a defective ball
1, Change the picture please!!!!!!!: I read the reviews prior to ordering
0, Not been able to inflate it fully yet: We have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet. The go fit customer service is open only monday - friday 9 - 5.So we haven't used it yet. I think i should have just bought it from a local store. The instructions are quite poor.
1, Great purchase: A coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. Great value
1, Big
1, Having fun with the ball: My husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using. It has served that purpose very well
1, comprehensive book: This book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems. Very rich in detail. I found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
0, Huh???: This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat. I like Toby Keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three CD's (None of which are any good or have any worth) and make an extra buck. It's just sad.
0, Effortless and Misleading: When I bought this box set
1, What is this gorgeous chaos ?: Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
1, thoroughly enjoyable
1, A great guide in simple terms!: A great
1," more than ""disco"": In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd"
1, Childhood favorite: This was an important book to me when I was a little girl growing up in Colorado. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end
1, Delightful: I loved this book as a young girl. I loved the message about finding your talents and making the most of them
0," ""You Get What You Pay For""!: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated)"
1, Oscar de la Renta Eau De Toilette 8.0 Oz.: My wife thinks this product is identical to the product we found in local stores
0, Hate it: We hate this thing. Hate. Hate. Hate.Even though it is supposed to hold three bikes
0, Serious flaw with this bike rack. Screws made of PLASTIC!: At first glance this rack seems well designed. In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure. However
0, Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors: The Quality is tenth rate
0, Good show. Bad release.: Air is a pretty decent show
1, Heller with a gun: This novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers. A excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
0, Best Keep As A Secret: This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast)
1," Start here: These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of ""the stereolab sound"".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy"
0, Not what I Thought: I bought this book thinking this was Historical fiction...I was wrong
1, tactful approach to adolescent obesity: This movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully. Could be shown in high school health classes.
0, Below Par: I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director
1, Another great Feinstein golf book: Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books
0, A Good Open Spoiled: The subtitle should be
1, Deadliest Plane Crash reveiew: DVD was in excellent condition
1," One of the Best Texts in ""Calculus Reform"": If you read it through and through"
0, Nearly useless as a calculus textbook: I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition
0, I wouldn't recommend this book....too much dam sex!: I wouldn't recommend this book...I believe that Roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot going....I didn't enjoy reading Goodbye
0, Drunk SpongeBob?? A Disappointing movie.: NOTE FOR PARENTS: What was Nickolodeon thinking?? SpongeBob and Patrick stuff themselves with sundaes then behave like drunks...down to the staggering about
0, 100% CR**!: What the f**k is this? The TV show was funnier than this garbage! People who doesn't have seen this movie
1, Great movie: I loved this movie. It's about Sponge Bob and Patrick going to Shell City to get King Neptune's crown. ANd while SB and P are going to Shell City Plankton takes over the world. IT's a great movie. See it.
0, Worst Movie in years!!: This is just pethetic! I don't get the point of watching the movie. There was abot hmm... 2..3 funny parts that don't EVEN GO WITH THE MOVIE! Even my dad fell asleep in the movie. I should'nt even tell you the stroy. It's so STUPID! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF you buy
0," ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever""!!!!: I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy"
1, Great case: I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height. Glossy black piano finish.... it only appears cramped if you fail to plan... I use modular P/S and tie down all the cords ...getting ready to buy another.

1," Nebula Awards are synonymous with great SF: ""Nebula Awards Showcase 2006"" is another collection of stories that you read and don't forget immediately. Another great-deal-treasure through Amazon."
0," Disappointing: This book was suggested reading as if "" THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM"" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view."
1, Happy with the product: I have had the case for a month now and I am very happy with it so far. The case holds my TX nicely. No problems with the belt clip either. Very good product for the price.
1, Palm case: I love this case. It is very hard to keep my palm protected. I carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work. Befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm. This case prevents any damage. I LOVE IT!
1, Good
0, Legal Mumbo Jumbo: This is truthfully worthless books. I had counted at least 20 typos on this book. I also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not. It is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book. The litigation only contains New York

0, Pretty and very BORING!: WOW! I was hoping this game wouldn't be as bad as people said. It really sucks! No fun at all. Pretty to look at on my 1080p-but that's it. Fun-factor = 3/10 Glad I only paid 37.00 for it. In a nutshell
0," why do you pay someone to write your reviews?: I tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction. The only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro. Don't believe me.......read the other ""reviews"" they have left. Buyer beware....any company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written."
1, Enjoyable and Instructive: I bought the Drawing & Painting Fantasy Beasts and the Fantasy Figures books for our high school library. The kids really enjoy them and so do I. I just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies. While these books may not appeal to everyone (not enough step-by-step for true beginners)

0, NaST like a teST: I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
0, Only one part was good in this whole book: This book is about some girl from Barbados named Kit Tyler who has to move to Wethersfield
0, OK: This book was ok to me. It dragged on quite a bit but I really liked the ending. I didn't like how it would talk about the same thing for over 3 chapters. It just felt like it wasn't my kind of book. However
0, Boring: After purchasing this for our home library
0, Very bad work by Elizabeth Speare review for Mr. Jones: I think this book was boring. The only exciting part is the witch hunt. Most of the time they talked about polatics. If they wern't the were cring over petty grevences such as love. This is why this story was boring. The characters were annoying and obtuse
1, Love this book: I have read this book several times since I was a pre-teen. It's like visiting an old friend each time. I love it. One of my all time favorites.
1, The Witch of Blackbird Pond: The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good book. It is about the early American settlers
0, An interesting but predictible book: This book was semi interesting. I liked certain parts
0, A Girl who lost everything takes her chances in Wethersfield: This book was an overall 1 star book. The quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic. This book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action. The characters
1, A Joy to Read: This book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read. Kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of Barbados in the late 1600's and live with a strict Puritan community in Connecticut. She has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh. One of her special relationships is with an elderly Quaker woman

0, this album suxxxx: i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutes.......it was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the same.....get What's the story morning glory....it rocks
0, Not all that: I am a Oasis fan and to be honest Be Here Now isn't very good . The only good songs are d'you know what i mean 
0, not terrible

1, A terrific follow-up to their last album.: I loved Oasis' first US album
0," Another example of cocaine-fuelled excess: ""Be Here Now"" does have its moments (""D'You Know What I Mean"""
0, Boring...: The songs in this album are quite boring
1," This one amazing album!!!: I like Oasis because their songs are rhythmic and I like the lead singer's voice. All of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good. There are 12 songs on this album. I like the 4th song "" STAND BY ME "" because it's really nice when they say ` stand by me"
1, Thank god we have Oasis!: These album is their best work yet
1, Top one!! Mad for it: Why do Yankees always put Oasis down eh? They are the Greatest band ever. I live in the same City as they did and I'm listening to their music 24/7 People just get jealous of their success. If anyone agrees or disagrees e-mail me instantly!!!!

1, Billy Joel My Life single: When I purchased this cd I did not know what to expect. I have been a Billy Joel fan for my whole life. I was very surprised during the first listen. Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound. I hope there is more to come. Joseph Leonardi
1, Great book: Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!
1, Fun Read!: This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd
1," The Gadget is it ""Too Good"": The Gadget by Paul Zindel is about a thirteen year old Stephen Orr. His Father is a scientist that works for the Goverment in the time period of the 1940's. If you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect. Stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him. Matt Hadsell. They both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded. As my title says ""Too Good"" thats exactly what this book is"

1, nice Pitcher: Received the item and it is just like advertised. Purchased it to replace a small frothing pitcher so I can foam milk for more than one cup of coffee.Nice quality pitcher.
1, excellent: perfect for frothing. well built product. would buyanother in a heartbeat.no more dribbles from a roundedged vessel i was using previously.
1, Works well
1, Frothing Pitcher: Given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee maker.They used it for their guests same day (!) and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher. It's a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
1, The Fall of Reach: This book is very good. The story line is fantastic and I cannot put it down. There is one problem
1, These books Rock!: Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game

1, It was pretty good: I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However
1, If you run you have to give it a try: I read ChiRunning in Sep 09. It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running. I've been ChiRunning since.It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints. I now run 4x a week
0, Not worth the time: I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old

1, Great Headphones: I use these for blocking out noise at the office

0, Excellent Audio
1, Only one problem with the backgammon set: I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks
0, hmmm...: Would I recommend it? Yes
1, I think you should read this.: I think it was a very good book
1, I own this - so should you...: I'm a professional chef and a big fan of German knives. I like a heavier knife in my hand that I know will do the job all day long that I want it to. This set is amazing and I use it every day. Granted; I have swapped out a few of the garnish instruments for what I prefer to use (hate the zester and the peeler). Turned heads when I first brought it out at work but everyone wants to borrow my knives now due to their superior quality and sharpness. I wanted something other than a tired out knife roll that everyone has and have not regretted a single second of owning this item.

1, Batman Scores A Win: Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne and the rest of the crew(Liam Neeson
1, Best Batman Series!!! Great Beginning!: Best Batman Series!!! This is a great start to a fantastic story line! This gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the Dark Knight!! A must see film and must see series!
0," Review Style comment: If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine"
1, Batman Begins Blu-ray: Muy buena adquisición
1, A New Batman: I have all the Batman Series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back. I wanted the new take on the character. The movie doesn't disappoint. It goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character. The cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film. This is a more serious Batman than some of the other incarntions. The action is fast and cast is great. I will enjoy this movie over and over.
0, no batmobile!!!!: -1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
1, The Best Batman: As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter)
1, title for my review.: I rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for DARK KNIGHT RISES!!! This movie was awesome
1, may be a bit overrated: I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit
1," Cool movie but NOT ""THE BEST EVER"": I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones"
1, batman begins: batman begins is the best movie of 2005!christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing it!this movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanels.so bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan
1, Very Good: Very entertaining. Good quality Blu-Ray for the theatrical version. HAve not yet explored the special features.
0, I'm not sure why this movie got good reviews: I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful
1," Best Batman movie until Dark Knight came out.: Batman Begins was such a relief for Batman fans. Finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction. This one is definitely the 2nd best Batman movie to date.. and I say that because The Dark Knight was just so damn good. Even if you're not a ""superhero"" movie fan"
0, It's below average.: It contains a lot of action. However
1, a good batman in long time: i saw this movie this past summer it
0, This movie was never that good.
1, Batman Begins: It was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It came in great shape and even included a comic book!
1, It has been said before but bears repeating
0, Would Not Recommend this Toy: My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it
0, Sounds like a good idea
0, Could be better: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now
0, Disappointing: Firstly
1, Crystal clear production and interesting arrangements.: I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically
1, Athletic Director: GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!
1, Weighted walking vest: I really like this product..i've been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for jogging...and i have seen results already...it's funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost 10 lbs...the only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really can't wear it under clothes
1, GoFit 10 lb walking vest: This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing
1, GoFit walking vest: This vest was just as described and the fit was great. It has wide shoulders so the comfort is good. Since I had never used a walking vest
1, Pretty: These are very pretty but I did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red. In a few years as I add more colors to my tree I will have them.
1, Hard To Heat: I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time. I use them in my massage practice as hot packs. The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile. The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it. I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it. UGH it is a pain. Haven't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly. Otherwise I love it.
1, Great product.: I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro
1, great save for my Mac from my toddler !: This little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family! I feel safe leaving my 3 year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on. Really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore. It would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely
1," Chirstian ""Death"" Metal: Yes my friends of this great indstry"
1, Excellent Value: Got these to put in my camper

0, trash: This cd blows nothing worth listening to. Really sucks the big unit. One of there worst cds.thank you very muchyour welcome
0, Unhappy....Constantly Turns Off: Very disappointed with this amp. It has an auto shut off
1, Simple Amp: This amp does what it is supposed to do. Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the AB speaker switches don't allow output to go to both speakers at the same time. Maybe this was in the write up but if so I missed it.
0, Too noisy: An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
1, Just what I was looking for....: Great AMP for the speakers in my garage and Lanai.....Sounds great and easy to useSimple is good...plus the price is right!
1, Works very well: I have a whole-house sound entertainment system
0, Horrible Audio
0, Not good unless you have a good knowledge of math: I'm not a math cripple but I will admit that I have not always been that great when it comes to math. I have recently grown a hunger for science in general

1, Great Shorts for work or play: I have bought about 6 pairs of this short. They are very confortable and wear very well. I'm pretty hard on them because I wear them for work. The hold up very well
1, A compelling Biblical story: This Biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of King Hezekiah. The characters have depth and I am eager to read the next book in the series.
1, Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings # was a great introduction to the series. I gained a different insight into the History
0, God's and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1: This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!
1, History in action: I love history - especially Biblical history and this book uses the information in the Bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive. It seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon.
1, It send be back to the Word: Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great.
0, Did Nothing: I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
0, did nothing: I got the tea fast

1, The Train Delivers!: Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold

1, The best heart and key pendant set ever!!!!!!!: Absolutely one of the most beautiful little necklaces around. Get it and you will get lots of compliments on how nice it is. I was so happy that I purchased it.I had been looking for over three years for the perfect heart and key set
0, Impossible to read: The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
1, Superb seller and wonderful product: Date: 11/28/2008 (I bought this for Christmas 2008)My brother-in-law had wanted a Clint Eastwood Poncho for a long time but the ones I saw were pretty expensive. Then I saw this one on Amazon. Not only was the price right

1, Not So Scary Anymore: I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say
0, Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc: I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
0, Missing most of the play!: This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV
0, duplicate dvd: This is the same dvd that I had previously purchased with a different cover. I will keep it because I like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
1, Different: This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs
0, Do not buy: I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed
0, Boring Book: I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes
1, Not too powerful
0, Ew!: Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs
0, not enough calories: This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories
1, Too Bad they broke up: These guys really are great. Too bad they broke up before they could really big. they're big but i mean REALLY big. I'm planning on buying this album once i'm not broke. I've litened to thier free mp3s on mp3.com and they are really good. I look forward to the purchasing of this album.
1, A great book for everyone: I didn't think anger was a real problem for me until I got married and some things I thought to be essential needs weren't being met by my spouse. This book has shown me some powerful principles on how to understand and deal with my anger constructively rather than destructively.
0, this is a christian based religious agenda book: It's a trick ! unless you have a religious outlook don't buy this book ! Just got it today and it sneaks in all sorts of nonsense.
0, not a christian and can't use it in my work.: this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
1, Ahhhhhhhh!: This back brush is what I have been looking for for a long time. others I have tried were too soft or were of sponge material that deteriorated quickly or fell off the handle. This one is a good
0, Big Minus: This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
0, Bloody Awful: I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
0," Typical rightwing garbage: The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the ""Just say no"" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well"
1, Preparing for adolescence: It was so true! And definitely helpful. Teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through.
1, Rational Anti-mysticism: Healthy debunking: Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view

1, Ionic Breeze Review: I bought this product for the girlfriend
1, Funny and smart: These guys are really a good match together. So funny and fun to watch with the family. I wish it had the Thin man
1," I know I'm biased but..........: This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the ""Thin Man"" seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films age.As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping inWal-Mart i'm that easily pleased"
0, Run
0, depressing and scary: I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome
0, Disappointing romance: Writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance. Couple doesn't get together until the end of the book. Big disappointment and some mistakes with Civil War history.
1, Ideal Weight: After having numerous store-bought scales
1," Dennis back on form: Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the ""old band"" while retaining a fresh"

1, A colorful and vivid album
1, Wonderful Collection: I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd
1, Wires and Wood: Saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great. This is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
1, good stuff: As a huge fan of Buffy-only the original novels
0, what a waste: My poor son was so eager to play with this toy after receiving it for his birthday. But he was quickly disappointed. The tank was too heavy when filled with water and the straps would not adjust enough to fit on him (we had to rig the straps). The tube would come out of the tank when i tried to pump the tank. Which I had to pump repeatedly. Was not a toy that he could play with on his own
0, I don't think nephew ever played with it.: I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
0, Really needs an AC adapter: See the reviews for the AUA-1422 - a similar item with one extra 1394 port. Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V

1, Sixteen-and active: Keir Gilchrist
1, Sweet story: Great story of a teenager who spends a week in a mental health ward makes new friends and changes his life.
0, ugly lighting
0, Slow Paced and Dragging: Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
0, IZ: Fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music... it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music. not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny (but i do see it getting old quick)
0, Disappointing: I give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my Bose. I returned them once
1, Loud fast
1, Excellent sauce whisk: I love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean. I highly reccomend getting one for yourself.
1, R. Kelly is still on top!: R. Kelly is still on top! TP-2.com consists of 19 blazin tracks
1, freak come out at night: r kelly goes back to his freaky roots on this one
0, Once again R kelly has done it.......but did we want him to.: R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is
1, best r&b album of the year: I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.
1, great understanding to helping yourself: this will help you to under stand life and your own self needs and how to listen to your inter soul if you follow your owen heart. it has helped me to see thing a little different.
1, Amazing!: Love this book
1, Phenomenal Reading Material! Lots of Fun: I'm naturally a huge fan of Jeff Corwin and his work to help nature and its inhabitants is very much needed these days. He does a wonderful job in putting you in the locale that he is in. Vivid descriptions and his natural mix of humor makes this an excellent book for any reading enthusiast. Great photos included. Definetely worth adding to your collection. You'll have lots of fun reading it!
1, Interesting and fun read!: Jeff Corwin is an amazing man who has many adventures to share. His love for animals shines in every word he writes.
1, Great Children's Story: The Precious Moments Stories are great.We like to keep them in our home to share with childrenthat come to visit ~ we enjoy watching them over and over again as well.

There are those that will pay any price to keep him from unraveling the truth.

1, One of the greatest plays in English Literature: I have read this play and also performed the part of Joan on stage many times. Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English

1, If you read only 1 book about the death penalty

0, Poor product from dishonest dealer: Ordered two
0, unseen is the word: I read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on National Public Radio. Ms. Gibbons was gracious
0, Definitely not Prodigy's best material: Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason
1," Great tune!: The Prodigy are back!""Baby's Got A Temper"" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless"
1," One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!: The first song I heard on this album was ""Bounce"
1, Good but doesn't top the first one: As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort
1, COOL: Awsome cd...almost evry song is worth listening to...prison song
1, Overall pretty good: I'm going to make this short and sweet: it's not the greatest album in the world because I still can't listen to the whole thing straight through
0, [bad deal]: Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
0, I may have enjoyed this album
1, Real good music.: This CD is really 
1, One of Systems Best Albums: Along with their self titled album
1, Awesome!!: This is one bad [rear] group! I have both of their albums and the only problem is that I listen to them so much that I can't get the songs out of my head.Killer lyrics and wonderful beats. You won't be disappointed.
0, Bunch of Garbage: There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
1, shock to the system: Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity
1, Buy this cd!: This is a great cd.I have listened to this cd probably 20 times and it never gets old.All the songs are good.
0," Complete Liberal Garbage!!: This music is sooo old and tired. These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones...""Lets all Riot"
0, Um......: Ok..... Chop suey is the only good song on this cd.. if u expect that this cd will be like there Last LP that's where your wrong.. they seem to have a christian\gospel touch...insted more of a heavy metal\rock touch... if u want some real metal\rock try Slipknot

1, Amazing book for future study in Tort Law: I would recommend this book to law students in both pre-law and law school. Well written and covers important cases.
0, global puzzle: poor Adam Crall
1, Cool puzzle
0, I'll Pass on this next time.: Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
1, New Developments for the middle of a series: I thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot world's development. The first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters. This has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series. Overall worthwhile. Reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
1, Another top-notch film about Victoria by Victoria: Victoria Hamilton seems to pop up everywhere
1, Pure Pop for Moog People: Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day. The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music. The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for: Catchy
1, Satisfying your supernatural cravings: If you like battles against ultimate evil
0, Lamebrain to the hill.: Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here
0, Overblown Mess: This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring
0, Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?: Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz
0, Weak
0," Should have read the reviews before I saw it.: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book ""Hellblazer"" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves"
1, Finally I can pre-order the DVD!: I haven't been able to get this movie out of my head. I love it
1, creepy cool: Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic
0, Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?: This movie is garbage
1, Yay: Some wear and tear on the case
1, Good Movie!: this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now
0, What the HELL were they thinking?: Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly
0, AWFUL.....................: My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
0, Dumb and pretty bad.: What do you get when you have an actor who can't act
0, Pure stupidly: Horrible and down right stupid Keanu Reeves action/horror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke. I feel sorry for his fellow actors which Includes Rachel Weisz
0, Pretty bad: Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script
0, Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves
0, Not even a B movie a Z minus movie: Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind
0, Comment on CONSTANTINE: I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said
0, This was the worse.: Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over
0, Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster.: Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix. Keanu Reeves is semi-fine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently. I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz
1, Additional Info: Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
1, good strong tires: I brought this tires for a friend in 26 x 1.75 she hasn't had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them....
0, Be careful: I bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads
1, PRAISE THE LORD: I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY USEFUL Being a practicing Christan and not being into WICCA or Witchcraft I have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now. I had always associated such practices and being associated with Satan worship. Boy was I dead wrong. The author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universe...and not at all negative like I had thought. I got out my Bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around. I felt very peaceful . . . I had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life (its somewhat of a personal matter so I wont go into it here)
0, WASTE WASTE WASTE: All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
1, Good for price: Yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly
0, Inedible: I made this gum with my 8 and 4 year old daughters. I ended up making 99.9% of the recipe myself. The gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy. The food coloring (red and blue) stain everything and is impossible to get off of your hands...you HAVE to use you hands to knead the gum. The worst part is that even after all of that
0, Delivery time too slow: From the time of order to receipt
1, The Black Crowes are incredible!!: One of the last great southern rock bands is back
1, Man of Many Trades: This book taught: That we can master more than one trade
1, At first he seems just an ordinary kid...but wow what a life: This is a marvelous book and an easy read. Even though Ben Franklin seemed to be just an average guy
1, Good insight to Ben Franklin: I had heard many different things about Ben Franklin
1, I wish I had read this earlier: This book was written to instruct and encourage young people (men
0, ben franklin: dont believe we received this book ...could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book
0, boring: I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me. So that is why it is one star.
0, Not for the Southern Hemisphere.: Quite a well thought out book to take around with you.BUT... limited use to me as there are no Southern Hemisphere maps or details (even the Southern Cross is absent).Would not have purchased it had I realised. At least it was cheap!
0, johny heeering
0, Kindle version: You cannot search terms.. every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over 40 pages.This is not worth almost 10dollars for kindle version. Your better off with print. The kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
0, Almost too bad for MST3K...: This was one of the worst Sci Fi movies ever! You have to turn the car off or the EM pulse will fry it? Pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when it's off
1, Really works!: 1 star because it is messy but this is AMAZING. I've used the freeze away crap and it doesn't work and is too expensive. This is cheap and will work within two uses. Make sure you wrap the area tight though!
1, Success At Last!: Like many others
0, disappointment: After reading all the great reviews I was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work. I was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so I could tell that it was working. I tried using this several times and it did nothing. I don't know if I just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when I opened it. Too me
0, Doesn't work good
0, terrible product: Bought this to remove a wart. Weeks later of apply several times a day...minimal results.I threw it away. What a joke. I did then buy trichloroacetic acid 50% and boom...the wart was gone.More expensive
0, Not worth it.: I had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying. I was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor
1, So far I am impressed!: Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So
1, Great Item: I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
0, looks like chap stick: I got the wart stick for my grand daughter (11 yrs old) she has a wart on her hand and foot! but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick! and my Grand daughter has a lot of little friends.so the stick is at the dump.there for i don't know if it works or not.
0, With Love by Hilary Duff: This product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering it.Don't like the scent anymore however
0, NOT AS MY EXPECTATION AT ALL!: I thought it's a score book
1, Building up steam...: Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful
1, Great classic
0, Looked cool :(: I am an avid ps2 gamer. I purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience. Was I ever wrong. The device has a battery indicator on it with 4 bars. When the batteries go down to 3 bars
0, BALLS EVERYWHERE!: We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!
1, not just for the over 3 crowd: Santa bought this for my then 11 month old for his first Christmas. He and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells. (The cats do too.) I don't think you need to wait for age 3 as recommended. I do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already. I highly recommend this product
1, Great Product!!: I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys
0, Flimsy and Seams Coming Apart: I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly)
0, You call this a mystery?: I don't get what people like about this book. Lindsey is a fluid writer
0, Disappointed!: Although David Lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose
1, Great for 18 month old and 4 year old!: My girls love this. It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well. I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead. The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic.
1, Lost Balls....Found?: Nice book
1, Great toy but Hard to turn off: A review from a kid.: pro's :great fun
0, Not like the ones I've seen--not as good: Instead of being a better product
1, My kids & all their friends love this game!: My 7 & 9 year olds love this game - and we have gotten it for all of their friend's birthdays
1, It's Grrrrreat!: My wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends. It's fun to think of an object (20Q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things) and answer it's astute questions and it usually gets it right. Sometimes it has to go on to 25 questions though. Kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device. Highly recommended.
1, Classic
0, ...: The music on this set is fine
0, Nice instight hidden in the pages: The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes)
0, Too much money for too few channels: This antenna may work for some people
1, Best Book on VB.NET I've Found: This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET. It is well written
0, Obfuscation of even the most trivial slices of code: Bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews online; book is almost totally unreadable as it takes even the most simple pieces of code and over complicates them to the point where you just end up closing the cover and say what a waste of money.
1, Great cookbook: I purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in Trinidad. He was not able to buy a cookbook while there.I searched Amazon and bought the one and only Trindad cookbook
1, One of the best books of all time: This book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in New York City. The vividness of the images
1, touching: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn 
1, An Awsome book that you must read!: Francie is a girl who is dirt poor
1, Three Thumbs Up!: I give this book three thumbs up! It is poinent
1," Fantastic reading: I have read "" A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult"
1, It's not hype!: This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written
0, A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however
1, Saw the: movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read.
0, A Classic?: I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
1, A Lifetime Favorite: My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
1, Great book
0, Credit Cards Will Not Fit: All the credit card slots are to small for credit cards. I had to cut each side of the slots to get the cards to fit.
1, It's both gorgeous and a good read: This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months
0, Dissappointing at Best: The book does not live up to Traditional Home's reputation of quality work. Frankly
1, A Story Everyone Must Know...: Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley
1, Well Worth Acquiring!: Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers
1," ""Conversation"" video: I bought this video for the ""Conversation"" video where Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams Jr. are playing their guitars"
0, Not What I Expected: I looked forward to this celebration CD very eagerly. However
0," How did Brian Mcknight and Russell Crowe get on this CD: I couldnt wait to hear this CD cause i love Kris Kristofferson and his work. many of the names on the CD were great and some great singers came out to do triButes to Kristofferson. Shooter Jenning's ""Silver Tongue Devil and I"" is amazing. Willie Nelson's ""The Legend"" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on ""Why Me"" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's ""Darby's Castle"" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity ""Me and Bobby Magee"" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of ""Me and Bobby Magee"" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged."
1, Hooray for Doris!: These two albums have been (thankfully) put on one CD. Doris is at her best here

1, Excelent: This is the second time I bought the same book from Stamatis.The first one I gave to one friend. He push me do give it as a gift.This second edition is far better.
0, every since i saw one on tv: every since i have seen on on tv i been scared.it's sounds wierd too.i don't like the music maker.get an idog
1, Good System: I've used the Voice Alert System for about a month now. It works good but does false trigger some. I've tried moving the sensor and adjusting the sensivitity and it has helped. I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area
0, Voice alert system 6: I am sorry that I ever bought this thing
1, Great Puzzle: Although it took a long time to receive this puzzle
0, Too much sex!: Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep
1, First prize.: This book has found a permanent spot in my home
0, Do Not Buy: This item did not work and it just irritates your skin. You think it works because you see your skin being irritated and think that it's the product doing its job but it doesn't work. Not only was this way more expensive than the other corn sticks but it also was a waste of my money.
0," a total rip if you own ""Music has the right to children"": If you already own ""Music has the right to children"" and you are itching for more BoC like I was then just take a deep breath and be content with ""Music.."" becasue this cd is a money making scheme just about. All the songs on it are the same ones"
0, Violence Bonjour?: How many graphically described violently mutilated corpses do they think it takes to sell a book? Having rather enjoyed Deja Dead (the genre of lady pathologists seems to be the flavour of the month)
1, Watch Out for Those Bones: Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner
0, Dull
0, Awful!: This book was boring and poorly written. The plot was weak and obvious
0," What is your definition of good?: Readable and missing no pages? Wow! I was in the book business a long time and this paperback I received was not in ""good condition:"" it was dog-eared"
1, Good
1, Holy Grail Found!: I've been after the vinyl for these two albums for 10+ years....it is considered the holy grail of west coast (USA) psychedelia. I gave up and bought the CDs through Amazon. Better than I thought. An absolute classic and equal to the reputation. Years ahead of its time but yet perfect for the summer of love generation. Everyone I have played it to are equally high in praise.
1, Too much is not enough: My boys
1, A good collection: I 've always liked this release for the following tracks: Ghosts of Cape Horn and Make Way for The Lady. The others are fine too with the sole clunker being the wretched The Auctioneer which is so out of place here. If I want to hear that nonsense
1, Dreaming of more...: Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet
1, Vivid descriptions and fast moving plot: Although it has been some time since I read this story
0, TERRIBLE!!: I have never entered a review before
1, THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!: This book is ultra-rare
0, Too much: This book has too much of everything... except action.There isn't much of a story and it's way too long.There's a lot of endless talk about the same subjectsand lots more sex than any other Asimov book. Theother Foundation books were fine for all ages. This onehas way too much adult content. I think that 300 pagescould easily have been cut out. In fact
1, asimov is a genius.: Anyone who hasn't read about Hari Seldon and Psychohistory needs to. Though it's a fictional science in the book
0, Another one...: ...of those bands whose latest work disappoints me. If like me
1, one of the greatest TPB's of all time: If you like comic book deities even a slight bit
1, Great story
1, This deserves to be an Animated Movie.: I had already read this story before I got the compilation version. Thanos is by far one of the best villians I have ever read about. He appears to be a villian but from his point of view
1, A Collector's Review: An Awesome book because it is full of many heroes and many villians in the marvel universe.
0, a patchwork
0, Worst in the series thus far.: By far this is the worst book in the series. Maybe five pages worth of rebellion or plot development
0, Disappointing After the Really Great Work in 1632 and 1633: I discovered Eric Flint's work when a friend loaned me 1632. I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633
0, Not so much: I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.
0, I agree...just recieved today: This ring looks nothing like the picture. the diamonds are small and not very noticeable; I will be sending this back
1, Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Eternity Ring: I was looking for a small silver ring and this one was perfect. It exceeded my expections because the ring was not expensive at all. It is true to size and if you want a ring that sparkles quite a bit this one is it.Mrs. Mayville
1, I love this simple band: I wanted a pretty band with sparkle cause I hate to have a raised up stone with little ones for the scratching. But this ring is perfect. Smooth and shiny.
1, Decent: After having a lot of trouble finding a wedding band for my small ring finger
1, Back to the Movies: This product was handled and packaged fast
0, Worthless: This stuff is a ripoff. I found some at a local store and bought it just to see if it amounted to anything. It does not. Go to the store and buy a 24oz bottle of cheap body wash and a 2oz vial of tea tree oil. Empty 2oz from body wash and then pour tea tree oil in. Shake well. Same thing only MUCH stronger and a fraction of the cost.
0, Dangerous!: Be prudent. It is a dangerous concoction. The fumes can give a soar throat
0, Disappointed: I developed white spots on my legs after using a tanning bed. This product had GREAT reviews eliminating the appearance of these white spots. Unfortunately it did nothing for me.
1, starblazers goood: i just picked up the dvd of the first 5 episodes and must say that the vhs version {by jupiter} was much smoother and cleaner than this {dvd} version. however this is better than nothing as stated by others and my wife who has been a fan for nigh on 25 years now. so if you must have your starblazers as my wife does then definitely pick this up.AND SEND IN YOUR CARDS.
0, America is Going Deaf: I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music
0, The worst band ever: I've seen this band 2 times and believe me both times I wish they wernt on the bill. They are by far the worst band ever and if you like them you should be kicked in the head until theres nothing left of you. Seeing them live is like being kicked in the head anyway.
1, it DEFINATELY grows on you: at first listen
1, Beyond Excellent: I seldom *ever* find a book in my school library that is worth reading. This book was impossible to put down and kept me going back for more. I'm hoping the door is open for a sequel
0, The Transall Saga: The Transall SagaBy George MickcloudMark is a normal teenager who lives to be out in the wilderness. Mark goes on a solo camping trip through the desert when finds a strange blue light that when he touched it. It transported him to another planet and time. Now he must us every nature skill he ever learned to survive. Two years past and is now a strong dark colored man. One day he fined s a village under attack by an evil ruler he joins the fight and saves the king of the village and is made second in command for his bravery he is now part of this village and is starting to think that he wants to give up looking for the blue light a stay with his new family. But some people don't like Mark and want him to leave. Mark now has a price on his head for his death. Mark and his new family will fight for his freedom or die trying. Will Mark survive the war to go on to find the light or die defending his new life and family?
1, A Book I Actually Wanted To Read: This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!
1, A Great Book: I was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final. I am not a big reader so I was upset about haveing to read. The day after I got the book I got sick and had to stay home from school. To pass the time I sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours. This book was exciting and although it was slow at first
1, James Lee Burke-Dave Robichaeux series: This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series
0, Not worth the price: I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.

1," brings out the romantic in me: These are the romantic songs I grew up with and that is why I bought this CD. If you need a ""shot"" in the romance department"
1, My new FAVORITE FACE WASH!: The title says it all! This is hands down the best face wash I've ever encountered. Light
1, Great Whodunnit!: A classic mystery with plot twists throughout to keep you guessing. Watch for a spell-binding cameo by Stephen Herbster
0, Sloppy research: Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations
1, love it... she's wonderful...: Ít's one of the best books I've ever read. Was forced to read it for school so my expektations were the lowest ever... She's a very strong women and I like the way she gets what she wants. She's not afraid to make a sacrifice or two to have things her way
1, Love these diapers - they don't leak!: Okay
0, WHY DO WRITERS DO THIS??: This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin. He writes way too much about each individual film the actor's made up to the time of the book's publication and then gives away the ending to each and every one of them!UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
1, This book is wild
1, Buy this book...if you love nature.: Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert
1, Sums up my innermost feelings: I can't rave about this book enough
1, Nice: For what it is (an inexpensive tp holder)
0, Bring the old type back: At least with the old type you could hook a water hose to the outlet side and attach a sprinkler to it and not have to drag a hose up and down your garden roes knocking plants
0, I have three of these things--none of which work.: I am an old lady who doesn't throw anything away
0, Lazy reproduction of an old book.: Maybe this book is out of copyright or something... but this printing is a grossly lazy reproduction of the original printing. It's actually a copy of the pages - not even fit right to the book's size. They didn't bother to transcribe and properly typeset the text using a modern system
1, An Elric novel written by Authors who grew up reading Elric: I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy
1, fantastic pix of TEXAS: Beautiful pictures... excellent photographs If you want ton see Texas this book is it......

0, Im with Jim: The pedals fell off
0, Boring: The problem with this book
1, The most beautifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns: This is with out a doubt the most beatifuly written & illustrated book on Unicorns ever published. Every page is a visual & mystical treasure.I reccomend it to any & all seekers of light on the subject of Unicorns.

0, Disappointing: This is a fascinating subject
1, Very nice set especially for the money: Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
1, Clear and tremendously helpful!: I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources
0, What a stinker: How did this piece of junk ever get made? Granted
0, Dude whens it over: This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
1, I wish i could give it 100 stars.. because i'm cool: what a hot film. so intelligent
0, Dude

0, It is dumb: I borrowed this movie from my brother (thank goodness I didn't pay anything
1, Dude!!! Sweet!!!: This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.' But along the way things don't go as planed. It's a comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Sean Scott. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!
0," ehhhhh: I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing ""next track"" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good"
0, Trinity: This was not what I was expecting. It wasn't as funny as any of the westerns. Nobody is my name for example. Very disappointed
1," Newspapers are still a rag: ""Infamous Scribblers"" was a fantastic read. Newspapers haven't changed much since colonial times. the best part of the book was the historical facts brought up"
1, Very Fun Racing Game: Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.
1, Autumn
0, Not First Printing: I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line
0," The worst book I have ever finished!!: I can't believe people really enjoyed this book. It was tedious and dull. Nothing new happened once the stage was set. Of all the ""zombie"" reanimated-body books and movies"
0," I am now avoiding Moen faucets!: We had a Moen kitchen faucet with a ""lifetime warranty."" It is junk. It started dripping after 5 years"
1, If things were perfect
1, A MASTERPIECE of Electronic Music: This is truly a electronic masterpiece and will never been forgotten. I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now
1, Excellent: Moby's latest album touches on many genres of music
1, Great CD!: Very good CD
1, Moby Continues His Great Style: The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music
0, Don't fall for it! Your heart isn't made of plastic!: Why is this album held in such high regard? It sounds like some middle class white kid messing with his parents gospel records. The gritty heart-felt gospel recordings juxtaposed with the cold
1, An album for Christians and non-Christians alike.: You can dance
1, he gets it right: Your ears will thank you for buying this album. You can really chill out to it with all the musical styles covered - pop
0, moby = genius ¿? why ¿?: People are saying that moby is like a god
0, There is NO way this CD is one of the best of the 1999: I purchased this CD because everyone is raving about it. I mean I ever heard about it on a night time sitcom...but whatever the case
1, Results IN: Moby pulls off the album of the year.: I am not even done listening to every track yet
1, let's play: This was my first Moby CD and I brought it for my fiance's birthday. We both love it! We have brought the CD Wait for me and Last Night since then. Moby knocks the socks off of Lady G

1, A very good cd: This is a very good cd you should buy it! My favourite songs are Why does my heart feel so bad
1, remix: I like the CD. I found a real interesting way to be a part of Moby's music by mixing your own version of body rock at beatnik.com.
1, MOBY'S TITLE SIMPLY SAYS IT....PLAY: A really good CD....I wouldn't classify it techno
0, Never received it!: I'm sure if I had received it instead of the cloth map that was sent
1, Loooooooooooove this book!: I read this book over 13 years ago
0, The loudest stealth ever: Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth. Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud. Apparently they've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers.FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one. Buy it amazon or B&M; or better yet
0," I'm glad I'm not the only one....: This phone was fantastic for about 8 months. I could go about 100 yards from my house while talking without any interference. However in the last month the handset started ""Channel Searching"" no matter how close I was to the base and how good the signal. Two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since. I have done everything I can think of including change the battery and it continues to search and while it searches the answering machine doesn't seem to work. Oh well"

1, Satirical and funny...: I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester)
0, Trying...: The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile
1, Office Space Blu Ray Review: I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet
1," perfect christmus gift for manager or co worker: We recently organised a pot luck for our team an I selected this as gift. I sticked yellow note sticker all over the dvd case and left the words ""WORK SUCKS"" visible out side. when one of my co worker picked this gift and read read the sentence there was a big laugh in the room. and when he opened (removed the stickers) every one said it was the perfect gift with perfect packing for the occasion.Anyway movie is one of my favourite and must watch."
1, I Believe You Have My Stapler....: Ok
1, love this movie: I bought this for a friend who had never seen it. I was going to let them borrow mine
1, milton is the MAN: aaahhhh this movie sticks with you and is total classic comedy. from basic humor of just wierd names to the eternal red stapler this is an amazingly hilarious movie. i have never even been inside a cubicle (thank god) and i think this movie may have influenced that. milton certainly steals the show and then i see the same actor on a csi episode and realize he can talk normally and HAS NO RED STAPLER??? *GASP* but anyway...anyone can enjoy this movie whether they are a cubie with a tyrant boss or standing in the unemployment line. this is a new CLASSIC in my book.
0, Office Space: I ordered the movie Office Space

1, Cult Classic!: If you have ever worked in an office environment
1," Simply the best...: Yeah... I'm going to have to ""go ahead"" and rent this movie again because I missed most of it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard to keep up with the story line.Seriously though"
1, Life imitates Dilbert: If you've ever worked in a cubicle farm
0, hate it: this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
1," This is the only movie I have watch over 5 times!: I love this whole movie! I is my all time favorite. I am not really a movie goer but this is one that I have played over and over again and never get tired of it.""Corprate Account Payable"
1, A Great Flick!: A must-see for anyone that has ever worked in a cubicle environment
0, Get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy!!!: ... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas)
0, Busted DVD: I ordered a widescreen version from this retailer. Not only did I get a fullscreen version in the mail (along with an invoice that confirmed I ordered the widescreen)

1, Office Space (1999): This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam
1, Laughing at Ourselves: There are a lot of funny movies out there
1, So real it hurt: The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know
1, NOT just another space shooter: When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man
1, Works great
0, Mother Night: Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
0, A bit disappointing.: It's vintage Vonnegut
1, Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better: Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize
0, What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!: This was recommended to be a wonderful movie
1, the choices we have to make will always haunt us: a brilliant character study of an upper middle class jewish german family who escape to kenya in the days before world war 2. having to adjust to a different world
1, Great Movie!!!: A very compelling story about a boy and his colt
1, You Can Analyze Handwritting: Here at last is a book that simply and lucidly teaches you the extraordinary science fo Graphology. With clear
1, Good book
0, Hardly the Oregon Trail: This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead
0, Not a happy customer: This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product
1, A Truly Loud Phone: I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother who wears two hearing aids. Not only can she finally hear me on the phone
0, Ho-Hum........: With all the great material in the WEA vaults
0, Exploitation of sibling...: This book was terrible
0, Uninspiring Cd: The songs are third rated ones that do not inspire. Listening to these songs had to be one time only deal.
1, This is Great!!!: I bought this for my husband to be for Christmas. He grew up with the F Troop and wanted this. He loves it. I am very happy with my purchase. Great entertainment and it is CHILD SAFE comedy.
0, It's A Bust: Warning
0, Good book bad Digitization: The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page
0, Dull: I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book
1, Attention to Detail: The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism
1, Very Good: Pretty good. Like the DC version
1, Spans the Generations of Marvel Characters: A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties
1, this book is a marvel: MY SON IS GOING TO BE THRILLED WITH THIS BOOK ON CHRISTMAS
0, could have had more surfing: When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing
1, Review by: Christine Stevens: It has the episode Angel on it w/David Boreanaz...what eles do you want
1, nice set of songs: THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS
1, What I expected: These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set
0, Terrible Headphones: I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash
0, Another verbal window into the past: Once again
0, Disappointed: I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side
1, Inspiring: I listened to this book on cd which I have found is a great way to get insirational advice everyday and further myself as a person. I loved C.S Lewis's Mere Christianity. It gives a educated view into why he believes in God and more specifically the Christian God. He is a great writer and the book is very intellegent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0, Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding: I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately
0, Merely the same things rehashed: I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded
0, disappointing and childish: I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith
0, Quality works in poor quality packaging: For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last
1, The best explanation of the core of Christianity I have read. Fascinating.: It has been a while since I last got excited about a book
0, Book: The book took a while to get here
1, One More Review!: Hundreds of reviews of this book have been written over the years. And no wonder! It's author did not become a Christian til in his 40's when he came
1, Seeing the Truth in the Logic: For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking
1, Great book: Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
0, Why all the hype? A huge letdown.: In all fairness
0, Not very enlightening: As someone who has a genuine phobia of flying I thought that this book might provide some useful insights. After about a hundred pages I realized that it was just a lot of lurid filth. It is a total con. I ended up throwing it off the train somewhere in the middle of Manitoba. Probably the biggest rip since the Neverending Story.
0, A disappointing book.: The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit
0, Too thin: I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough
0, Why do people like this?: The costumes and sets aren't too bad
1, Magnifique: Eurasia's most inspired duo.Flashbacks envelope a bullet to the future.Not for the faint of heart.
0, FUTUREDOC: I have been through most of the test preperation books in the market
0, Solid math review but lacks application for the SAT: Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also
0, Below average CD
0, a story hidden in words: Way too many names
0, Aimless and self-absorbed: This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
0, Could Have Been A Fun Movie For The Kids: With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor
0, Not worthy of One Star. If the Academy gave out Oscars for: Worst movie
1, Worth the price of admission: I dont know how anyone could not laugh at this movie. It seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor. I wasnt a fan of Ben Stiller until this move. He is very funny in it. Despite the focus on humor
1, Not Bad: This movie was really silly
1, Good read for CA students wanting to learn about their histo: I'm trying to locate the abridged version that I taught from in the 60s. It's out of print and I would love to get come copies of it if anyone has any to use with my not-so-good readers now.If you find any please call me at 949-854-8889.
0," rating the physical book...not the story: This book is an excellent story. Lots of California history..or better..Alta California as it was known in the era.BEWARE OF THE PHYSICAL BOOK !!!!! It is about 10""x11""...printing of the story is VERY!!!! pale.I will keep this....but have ordered an older"
0, Had to return it.: After I install this blower fan it made a loud ticking sound. So I thought maybe it was hitting something. I uninstalled in and ran the fan uninstalled. It still made the loud ticking noise. So I had to return it. The bad part was that Amazon deducted 7.20 from the price I paid for the fan because I did super saver shipping. I don't recommend buying this fan or any auto parts from Amazon.com since they don't stand behind defective products.
1, Awsome!: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First
1, 10 Stars! By far our favorite toy!: This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer
0," WTF ???: Video only?Absolutely no sound from this ""NTSC"" DVD.I tried it on multiple machines and several computers...No dice...the soundtrack is absent.You have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show.Not very satisfying...I'd rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band.just a bit pissed in Puyallup"
1," Looking Back with Love: A tantalizing performance by Kathleen Turner. Anyone with a soul sometimes wants to go back in life to discover the great "" what if"" In this film Peggy Sue gets that chance to possibly change her life by going back ..there!Turner pulls it all off in grand style. The realities she learns are not as profound as she might think they are. Nevertheless "
1, It is like going back in time!: I love this movie...I love it because it lets me go back to 'visit' my Grandmother
1, cutting edge: Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman
1, funny girl: This is a very good movie. It is so easy to be able to order old movies and enjoy them again and again
0, Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education: This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes
1, Nice Book: Clean
0, Had to buy it: I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
0," lazy publisher: The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback"
0, jude the mundane: thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail.
0, Not an easy read: I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer
0, OK products
1, The Origin of Betty Boop!: Helen Kane is the flapper who was the model for Betty Boop. When you listen to this CD
1, works good: Works great now I get the best steamed veggies the company sent it fast I give the company and the steamer 5 star
1, Combo Saucepot and Steamer: Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family
0, Be careful it's hot
1, Great Steamer: Got this mainly for veggies. Works great and fast. Very pleased with it. It could be a little bigger but can hold 4-5 servings.
1," Excellent book!: To tell the truth I was a bit hesitant to purchase this book as loosing my ""joy"" was not something to which I was willing to admit.John Piper doesn't disappoint. His books are deep which is exactly what I needed as there are just too many superficial books on various Christian topics which tend to lack substance or depth or have any real effect in changing one's heart. John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you. If you are a mature believer who needs a good kick in the pants than this is the book for you. Awesome book! If it is what you need then you will NOT be disappointed!"
1, great great great: I WAS LOOKING FOR INEXSPENSIVE HDMI CORDS FOR MY PS3 AND MY NEW HD TV.. WELL EVERYONE TOLD ME U HAVE TO GET MONSTER CABLES THERE LIKE 50$$$ BLAH BLAH BLAH...!!!! WELL I FOUND THESE AND THOUGHT HEY THERE CHEAP SO IF THEY DONT WORK OH WELL.. BOY I WAS WRONG THEY ARE GREAT..

I EVEN GOT THEM EARLIER THAN EXSPECTED.( I KNOW I WAS CHECKING MY MAIL BOX DAILY) .I WILL DEFINATLY BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!
0, Very poor quality for HDMI: After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360
1, Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.: The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type
1, HDMI Cable: This HDMI Cable category 2 hasn't fail me at all. It works great
1, Great price--don't buy branded cables: If you can tell the difference between the images and sounds these cables transmit and those transmitted by more expensive cables
0, Adult who enjoys Good Children's videos: This was very amateurish. Don't think it would hold even the attnetion of a child
0," The Last Unicorn VHS: Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you"
0, Can't Manage to think about it...: The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie
0, The Last Unicorn: If I could give this a half star I would. I bought this for my children to watch and I felt with a rated G rating that I was safe. How wrong I was. I am ashamed to say that I let my children see this before I did. When the magician is tied to the tree and his magic brings the tree to life all I see is the tree and her huge breasts. And the magician is stuck between her cleavage. The world is getting sick enough that I don't need to show a cartoon to my children with this garbage in it. I am highly disappointed and so are my children because they cannot watch this movie. I think that you need to watch this movie first before showing small children.
0, I like Unicorns
0, Great movie
0, Fantastic Movie
1, Fantasy or reality: I have always loved this movie and was so excited to learn it was on DVD finally. A wonderful cast and wonderful music. I could watch it again and again. I love it.
1, A Truly Beautiful Film!: When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster
0, Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen: First things first: This is a nice movie for kids
1, Untitled: I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
1, Good movie: This is a great movie! I first saw it when I was about 6 and I still love it! Beware of the profanity! I recently saw it again and I was surprised to hear the bad language because of the G rating.
1, AN ALL TIME CLASSIC: People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
1, Next best thing to being in a Chicago blues club: Not sure why I added this one to my large collection but it is now one of my favorites. My biggest regret is not getting to see him live before he died. Unlike some CDs where there is only one or 2 good songs this one has lots of great songs.
0, Yet another version
1, Awesome drum for a crappy drummer.: This drum is sweet. It looks amazing coming out of the box
1, One glaring omission
1, A book for the ages: I mistakenly checked this book out of the library when I was in 4th grade (1964)
0, No Joy Here: The site of an immaculately turned out Susan Hampshire in thick eyeliner and gleaming white (flared) trouser suit prancing through the Serengeti should serve as an immediate red flag. This is about as far as you can get from Bill Travers' and Virginia McKenna's charming performances in Born Free
0, Disappointing!: This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship
1," Mini Shuttle Astronaut: I love this item! It occupies the top shelf of my ""sci-fi shrine"" next to my tiny Star Trek models."
1, Born Free!: This film is great for family! I watched online through Amazon Prime and it played perfect and was so crystal clear! I recommend this movie for all families!This movie will make you laugh and cry it is that Great! I will order this DVD through Amazon.com soon and add it to my library! This movie is also educational for everyone!I Just Love all Cats
1, BORN FREE: THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE
1, THE FAMILY UNDER THE BRIDGE: THIS BOOK HAD GREAT CHARACTERS AND PLOT. IT TOOK PLACE IN PARIS
0, Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids: This book
1, The Family Under the Bridge: This book
1, Mitford Years ammended: Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.
0, Disappointed: I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books
1, Perfect: Thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition. The book was great and I really love the whole series.
1, Absolutely the BEST: I have worn NARS Sunset Strip lip gloss for over 8 years and still continue to get compliments on the color. I have tried all the other major brands
1, Better than expected: My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far
0, The shadows between: The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man
1, Wonderful book!: I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.
1, Streisand at her comic best: This was Barbra Streisand's first non singing role
0, Warning - misleading listing: This item is advertised as being the R-rated (original) version. It is not! It is the reissued (and censored) GP-13 version which is not nearly as good or as funny.The listing should be corrected and we can only hope that one day the studio will release the DVD in its original version.
1, Anamorphic Widescreen: This imported DVD has a nice picture. It comes in the original aspect ratio of approximately 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. The audio is in Dolby Digital Mono and has Korean
0, Okay!: I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
0, misrepresented usefulness: Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles
1, The Slipper and the Rose: Finally
0, Caution with this supplier: this product is ok however
0, All show
1, Correction of author: author is Arloc Sherman: As can be found on eric.ed.gov and cbpp.org
1, A kitchen staple: I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage
1," great movie: I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun."
1, I believe he is right: Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.
1," remarkable!!!: I love this cd. My favorite song is ""Gills and Tails."" I have been following her music since she was with Groove Theory. True talent. She is soooooooooooo under rated. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AMEL!!!!"
0, A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.: As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy
1, Gods walk among us: This is the 2nd Dirk Gently novel and like the first it is good fun 
0, Boring: I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I did'nt buy it) and was really disapointed. The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal. Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time
0, you have got to be kidding me: I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
0, Sucked: I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money. It simply sucked.
0, Poor quality product: After 2nd or 3rd usage
1, Amazing bargain for the quality: I love this cookware! I had to leave my old kitchen things behind when I moved suddenly last fall due to illness and had gotten some cheap crud at Wal-Mart. BIG MISTAKE. After just 5 months it was a mess
1, Great!: I really love this pot. It's a bit larger than I expected
1, For the price
1, Perfection!: I love these guys! Finally
0, Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions: It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest
1, Excellent!: This book is very well written and researched. It is obvious that the negative reviewers on this site are the radical religious extremists that it is written about.
1, Wow.: Even if you know a lot of this stuff
0, Super-awful: It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that
0, poor quality: I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However
1, I've got the ice in me.: Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally
0, How not to write a book!: This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel
0, Eye opening: It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it
0," Rule#1: Just because it's published doesn't mean it's true.: This one of the worst abominations ever put in print to ""describe"" Catholicism. It is of note only for its ludicrous claims"
0, A codex of garbage: This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church. The truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the Bible in order to support Boettner's rancid work.The book is useful for Catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against Catholicism.As a source of honest information
0, Outrageous pack of lies: As a former protestant turned Catholic
0, No understanding of the Catholic Church: The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
0, May God have mercy on you
0, A Good Fantasy: Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page
0, Good idea that fails in implementation: I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time
1, UK TO THE FULLEST: SWAY IS AMAZING
1, A wonderful story: Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life
0, Not good enough: I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good
0," Made me feel icky: I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of ""the rest"".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling"
1, A good buy for Sedaris fans
1," Something more serious: If you enjoyed ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books"
1, Rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter: Being the first David Sedaris book I've ever picked up
0, A literary reality show?: Sedaris' book is entirely too self-aggrandizing to rate as entertainment. Spare yourself from the temptation to buy.Lamar Nesbit
0, Random rantings from a drugged homosexual: The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that
1, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim: Hearfelt essays on David Sedaris' life growing up gay in middle America. Always full of astute observations of American life
0, good pan
1, Farberware classic 10 inch frying pan: I've used Farberware for 40 years and have always loved their products. Most of my pots still look great after so much use. They cook food beautifully. The only problem has been with some of the handles loosening up after years of use. They can usually be tightened with a screwdriver
1, Fantastic: I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!!Formaggio del Cucina (Italian Cooking Cheeses 2 pound) by igourmet.com
0, It didn't help my vision: I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work
1, Terrific Album but what happened to 4 Strong Winds?: I saw the Heart of Gold concert from the Ryman Aud. on Showtime recently and found the music and staging superb.Neil sounded great and his asides between numbers showed how sensitive a performer he really is to those in his audience. I immediately ordered the Prarie Winds CD as well as the DVD. However I was disappointed that Four Strong Winds was not included on the CD. This is a beautiful song by Ian Tyson also found on CASH -V by Johnny Cash. I would hope that Neil's version will eventually make it to a CD in the future. I recommend both to all Neil's fans.
0, Great music
0, Prairie Wind review: The CD does not play. I have tried it in several different CD players and it simply doesn't play. The Johnny Cash CD I purchased with it plays just fine
0, Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted: I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2
0, Lost in stereotypes: A decent book that could have been great
0, If you like reading for the sake of reading...: Ultimately
0, Misguided Purchase: The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
0, Not as shown: This product is shown in its picture setup with a top. There is no top with this product and there are no supports or framework of any kind to set it up with. What you get is a white folded cloth in a bag.
0, No plot: The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
0, B movie: The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting
0, Ewwwww...: What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
1, Excellent (no spoilers): Only this and 'Sherlock Holmes' were grabbing my interest on the new Video On Demand releases. I was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick. I'm so glad I picked 'Triangle'. I haven't been this freaked out by a movie in a long time. There's truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end. Superb directing
1, stealth movie: a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
0, Don't waste your time: The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie
0, Poorly researched
0, very poor quality: I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality
1, trashy
1, Couldn't put it down!: I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school
1, The Other Boleyn Girl: This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down
0, Tawdry: For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns
1, Scandle
0, Not worth the time: First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century
1, Makes you want to keep reading on: A wonderfully written book that gives insight into a siginificant time in history with a very personnel look.
1, Easy reading: Book is very different than the movie
1, LOVED THIS BOOK: I loved this book. I seen the movie and have to say the book is so much better. I finished reading it then started reading it all over again. This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on
1, History Brought to Life: This book
0, I Already Knew the story: I have to admit
0," Historical Fiction Overdone!: With an emphasis on the ""fiction"" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well"
0, Finally finished it: I liked how it started
0, A novel for the intellectually challenged: Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will
0," ""Other Boleyn Girl"" a future Lifetime movie for certain: The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence"
1, One of the best books I have ever read!: This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family
1, Very enjoyable...: Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era
1," A ""can't put down"" book!: It's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's beautifully written. Gregory finds a great balance of description"
1, A Fast Read: I breezed through this book and I found it a great read. I had a hard time with some of the stuff
1, When Movies were More Fun: I had recorded this movie originally off of TV years ago. It is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories. What I really appreciated with this DVD is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
1, 13 Ghosts Review: I saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake. Then I found out that Martin Milner was in it and I knew I had to see it. This was your typical old black and white movie. With the typical dialogue that you would think. But I thought this movie was really funny
0, Disappointed....: I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
0, good idea
1, A very pretty decoration for all
1, Flawless: Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow
1, Clear and concise
1, Not just for breast feeding moms :-): Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms
1, PHOTOGRAPHERS HELPER: I don't have children yet
1, AWESOME PRODUCT: I LOVE THIS! I AM A FIRST TIME MOM WHO BREAST FEEDS MY BABY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE SUCH A LIFE SAVER! MY SON IS 9 MONTHS NOW AND WE STILL USE IT ALMOST EVERY FEEDING. IT SAVES YOUR ARM AND NECK FROM FEELING STRAINED AND HOLDS THE BABY AT JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL FOR NURSING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY MOTHER.
0, Don't really get it...not useful for us at all!: I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up
0, recalled boppy: I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first.
0, Wait to buy: I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews
1, A great product!: We got this to support our arms while bottle feeding (though it seems to be known for breastfeeding-it is helpful to us bottle feeders as well.) The unique shape is great because it can be turned to be comfortable for different sized people and different height chairs. Also
1, Great for taking pretty photos: This Boppy was very helpful in feeding my daughter during the early weeks of life. It also helped with laying her down when she was in the phase of waking up everytime you put her down. I would nurse her and then transfer her to the bed on the pillow
1, Roses are reds
1, This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute
0, Definitely a disappointment!: I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
0, SORDID BOOK!: While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature
0, how can you like this?: this book had good morals but it was so confusing
1, Golding at his Greatest: Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot
1," Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the ""The Lord of the Flies"" was to show that without laws"
1," all in all a good book: Well written but definately not my ""cup of tea"". High reccomendations for those who enjoy this type of literature."
1," A must read: The noval ""Lord of the flies"" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done"
0, Weird: I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls
0, Not the Best novel: Well I have read this in 7th grade. I really don't think of it as a great novel. I have read better. It depends on what your taste in novels are I suppose. I know that this isn't a good review on this novel and I am sorry if this misleads you. Well
1, You sure you want to read this?: This book is not for a rainy day. Rainy day's are depressing and exploring the dark side of the human soul is no less. If you are into dreams leave this book on the shelf. If you want to feel like puking from the pit of stomach at the depts of human depravity this is the book for you.One sentence to describe this book:A daring expose of the cruelty of children and a slap on the wrist of anybody who thinks kids don't need discipline.
0, Most Disappointed: Well
0, An unbelievable waste of time.: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel
0, Thumbs down: God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book
0, It's a good book
1, The Lord of the Flies is a great book.: The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school
0, Great book
0, It is worse than reading the dictionary: It was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i
0, Yow! Lots of people wrote stuff
0, Disgusted: I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone
1, Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel
0, Boring: I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part
0, I don't like the book: I am a fan of classic literature but this book was just too slow for me. Everyone should read it because it's a classic but I didn't enjoy it.
1, A brilliant achievement. Symbolism beyond comparison.: This is my favorite book yet (and by the way
1, great classic book: this book came on time and was in good condition. It has been on my list of books to read for a very long time
1, A fairly simple story with deep meaning: LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism
0, No wonder they call it the Lord of the Flies this book stunk: My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids
0, a conventional view of mankind: this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance
0, Took too long: It's great ordering a book
0, May be a classic...but not as good as people think: I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade)
0, Lord of the Flies was creative
1, A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.
1, Shocking: I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males
0, Novel review of the Lord of the Flies: The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out
1, Nice Book: I think it was a good book because the story was very interesting and easy to read . The message of the novel is very important important because it relates to ancient times
1, Adventouros story
1, Thought-provoking
1, Everyone Should Read this Novel: This is one of those novels that everyone should read. Through isolation on a remotes island
1, the what ol' days?: I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader
0, A girlie book with lots of blood: Friends who know I`m interested in war history recommended this book. But this is not war history. This is a rather banal love story mixed up with a lot of bloody details. If you are looking for the real stuff
0, Disappointing: Outdated and Not Useful: This book was written in 1987! Technically speaking
0, They cut the extras: I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray
0, Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan
0, very dull and witless: This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
0, Not for kids under 12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great
1, Compact Phono: Portable And Plays 78 RPMs: This battery operated little jewel allows playing of old 78's and stillsounds reasonable in it's single onboard speaker mode. It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..
1, A great
1, THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.
0, Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all
1, Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late: If you have a child that is late with speech development
1, How to go to College Almost for Free: I bought this for my grandson
1, Cool Book: I'm not much for writing book reviews
1, How To Go To College For Almost Free: This book is very informative. Ben Kaplan manages to convey the information in a fun and lighthearted manner. This is a great book for parents and students alike.
0, The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level
1," THE great American literary genius of the 20th Century.: Let's see now ... have you bought in to the ""PowerPoint"
1, Orson Welles and Magic: I have always been a fan of Orson Welles on radio and television. Having collected a ton of radio broadcasts on CD and audio cassette and having watched most of his movies
1, Used It For Years: We've used this product for many years. It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly. They shine better than they did when new.
0, Poor Service from Home and Beyond: I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week
0, Vapid and vacuous: The main character was insufferable. Parker has tried to create a male Spencer but fails miserably. She appears to be without fault and has an answer for everything. At least Spencer admits to feet of clay. The plot was implausible.
0, Dumber & Dumber: Yeah
1, Parker's new charge...: Being a huge Spenser fan I am of course a Robert B. Parker fan. Sunny Randall makes her debut in this yarn of sex
1, Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing
1, Awesome series.: The autumn series its just amazing
0, GSM Phones: Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only. Pull off your battery
1, excellent reading: this is the best book i have ever read on jesus other than the bible. this man was very knowledgeable about his subject. he was also very familiar with his subject [jesus] as you will see when you read this book. no christian should be without this book in his library.
1," typos galore!: I do not intend to review content here. This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the ""misspelled"" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author"
0, Overrated: This book is overrated by a longshot. If I didn't know any better I could swear that this book wasn't even edited! Turtledove has 50 things going on at once! There are too many characters and too little continuity. I would recommend this book to anyone who has insomnia.
0, Very slow: Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume
1, Fresh and exciting!: When I first heard the cd I was a bit shocked. These musicians really have a unique way of playing these pieces. I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen
1, Great for the beginner
1, Great product!: I took a chance ordering this product
1, A Definite Page Turner!: This was an excellent story about World War II. Three friends who share quality time at Sakkara on an archeological expedition are seperated by the War. Harry Waever is in military intelligence for the United States. His other two friends
1, Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological
0, Great book; the worst print quality you'll ever seen: The book delivered by Amazon.com looks like a photocopied book
0, Not good: I tried to read it
0," bad video: James Earl Jones butchers the narration of this 'live' presentation (he was far worse on the actual broadcast: this has been slightly edited!) and the actors portraying Clay Shaw and David Ferrie are horrible. This show was a classic example of the overkill that came after ""JFK"" came out in late 1991---everything good"
0, Good packaging - no mushrooms :(: While this mushroom kit arrived in good packaging and looked ready to go
1, satisfying middle book of a fantasy/romance trilogy: Valeria is now accepted by the Riding School
0, beware: First of all
0, Sometimes less is more!: I saw this film because I was such a fan of the orignal version. What a dissapointment. This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere
1, The Blob- Fear has no shape: This 1988 version of The Blob is fantastic. I Love this movie so much
0," A family saga that disappoints: I got this book because Ursula Hegi wrote an Oprah Winfrey pick ""Stone From the River"" some years ago and I remember enjoying that book.. While I love a good family saga"
1, Excellent even for those without formal musical training: Excellent book. Does not assume any musical training
1, Another rocking Weeds Season.: Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
1, Great series: A must have series. On the lines of Sherman Oaks if anyone actually saw it). Hats off too showtime. I only wish i could find the Sherman Oaks series on Amazon.
0," Kate Mulgrew before Voyager: ""A Time for Miracles"" is an underrated gem. Showing a bit of American history that is often neglected"
1, Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive
0, How To Write a Movie in 21 Days: I purchased and read this book because it was recommended by an author that has helped me develop in the screenwriting craft. But I didn't find it particularly helpful or practical. However
1, This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books
1, Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien
1, Out of the ashes: The Soka Gakkai was forged out of the rubble of postwar Japan. This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism. For the critic above one simple question
1, A Great Summary of Labor Law: I am an ESL teacher with a background in law. A Colombian lawyer who had previously studied with me asked me to help her with the differences between our labor laws. This book was an excellent introduction to labor law. Anyone who needs a summary of this area will benefit from this book.TCB
0, Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First
0," Superficial: I found the content of the book very superficial. It deals with eliminating the symptoms of lack of motivation: things like ""Kill your television"""
1, Good video
0, Did not fit BCM carry handle: Just as the title says. This mount did not seat properly or at all on my BCM milspec carry handle. i think these are hit or miss.
1, CCS Yellow Cutting Pad: Used with a Porter Cable buffer/vibrator
1, WORTH IT!!!!: Once we finally rec'd the correct item ( orig order not from this company
0, Terrible Disappointment -- parts don't fit: My son (almost 8) and my husband (an engineer) sat down to put this together. Many of the holes were either drilled too small or
1, Entertaining to the last page: Trollope is addictive
0, Printer won't work now...: I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge. Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly. My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge
1, good: I enjoy having a cartridge ink quick at my disposal . The cost is very economical. I will buy again.
0," I was not pleased: I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word ""COPY"" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original."
0, Trite
1, All That Matters: I thoroughly enjoyed both of Jan Goldsteins books. Both left me wanting more stories from him. Characters are alive and make you care about them almost immediately. I would recommend All That Matters to anyone and everyone.
0, Item Not Available: This item was out of stock
1, Twilight Zone fans will love it: I really liked this one. It's been a long time since I've read any short story collection
1, Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming
0, I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason
0, It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him! The fact that Grendel's mother is pregnant doesn't really play into the movie
1, Inspiring and Soul-Searching!: Through a Narrow Gate is a testament to the personal struggle between feeling the faith and wanting to somehow live it
1, Through the Narrow Gate: Older book with new foreword. Personal discription of life in convent by well-known religious author.
0, too goofy and cheesy....: Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books
0, Eggs stuck immediately: I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it
1, Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily
1, A daughter of the Mennonites: Very good. READ until 5:00 AM and could not wait to finish the book today. Would recommend it to any age group.
0, Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read
1, (Based on a) True Story: Hey readers out there. I just looked this book up because the November 24 edition of the Los Angeles Times ran the true amazing story of this incident. I guess now I'll have to read the book. When I do I'll come back with my review. You can get the LA Times on-line.
0, a great disappointment: The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat; where I planned on using the etrac. Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America.
0," Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler"
0, You've got to be kidding!: Why would they release such a complete mess like SciFi Wasabi as a single?...completely turns me away from wanting to hear the rest. Musically and lyrically a disaster. I'd rather sit through karaoke night at the local drinking dive.
1," Better Than the First: But not as revolutionary as the first album ""Viva La Woman."" I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica"
1, Excellent Movies: I saw Mission Impossible I when it first came out in theaters
0, Rust problems: This is a great kettle with one serious flaw. My kettle has started rusting inside the spout after 1 year. There is a lip where the spout joins the base and water is caught there after use.
1, A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been
0, Raises good questions
1, ellery queen mysteriesa: This was a very different type of book from what i'm usesd to. It was very goog.I am a big fan of ellery queen.
1, A very nice shoe: I bought this more for fashion than function
1, Great running shoe but why is price way up?: The double-edged sword of rating a product highly: you help out fellow shoppers but then the vendor raises the price. I bought this exact shoe 1-1/2 yrs ago for $45 w/free Super-Saver shipping. Now the shoe costs $73 + shipping? Maybe we should all keep our mouths shut. And what's w/the different pricing for different sizing? Sounds like discrimination to me. Could be a federal offense.I've given it 5 stars to see how much higher the price rises.
1, A classic: It was just as good as I remembered! The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie! Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
1, So sweet!: Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
0, Forced previews: The movie is fine
1," A perfect film: ""Babe"" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there"
0, Not Good At All: This is the WORST movie I have EVER seen. We had to see it in our class one day. The teacher said that I HAD to watch. Reluctantly
1, No Skip-Ahead function on this DVD: BABE is a wonderful movie
1, Dundee II: Very good sequel. Moderate amount of action & an actual plot unlike many new movies. If you own the first this is a definite addition to your video home library
0, Non-stick Coating Wore Off and is Chipping After Three Months: I bought this pan with high expectations given the strong reviews from other customers but after a few months of use I am very disappointed. The pan takes several coats of oil to prevent food from sticking and now the non-stick surface is beginning to flake off. I always washed the pan by hand and never used anything other than plastic cooking utensils. The last non-stick pan I had was Kirkland brand and it lasted four years.
1, Oldie and Goodie: My father got me hooked on these books. They are extremely well written and just fun to read. Anyone who just wants a good mystery without all the sex and swearing will love these books.
1, Excellent stuff!: This face wash is great
0, Worse than surgery: The jokes in this book are not only unfunny
1, Amazing but not his best: This is Jimi's most famous performance
0, poor: The product did not operate as stated on the box. The supplier CDROMUSA wasn't at all helpful and left me with a product I'm unable to use; so they got FREE money and refused to send a replacement.They don't deserve a star at all
1," movies that make you THINK: How many times in our lives have we wanted a ""do over"" in our lives thinking if we could just ""change"" one of our actions things would have been so much better in our present day lives. These movies make you realize"
0, Overpriced and too many restrictions on use: This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best
1, My recommended buy: Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware
0, Not good at all!: This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand
0, A Disappointment: I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but
1, The Power of the Witch: I loved this book. It's very informitive. I like the fact that my friend
0, Not Impressed by Cabot: I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style
0, A guide to one-night stands: This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically
0, Not entirely original...: Actually everything in the book IS helpful
0, Some reasonable advice.: I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these
0, Read The Art of Seduction instead: This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff
0, For anyone else
0, One of the worst spokeseman for my party..: Let this illogical hack please not defend my party
1, better than the swiffer: I love the simplee clean microfiber swivel mop. It is bigger and easier to use than the swiffer and you don't have to keep buying replacement sheets...just wash and go. A much more environmental and financial choice than other cleaning options.
1, My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!: I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop
0, Depends on your situation: I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference
1, Does a good job: Mach3 does a fine shaving job
1, Works just fine
0, Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.
0, Mach3 or crap3: Very poor quality
0, Somehow not as good as Birks: They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok
1, Very Nice!: My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach. It's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops.
1, good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys
0, Garbage!!!: I'll keep it short and sweet. This product is garbage. I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item
1, Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise
0, Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading
0, Clapton masterpices: I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton and his music dating from the Yardbirds forward. He's done a tremendous body of work. Unfortunately you won't find much here worth buying. The overall content and quality are pretty poor. Rather than masterpieces this more like the stuff left (for good reason) out of many other DVD's covering his work.
1, Long Walk to Freedom: Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland
0, slow moving
1, A very beautiful coffee table book...: I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!
1," worth the wait: It's great to finally see this album released on CD. I've wanted this for a long time. Hot on the heels of the ""Biggest Prize in Sport"" album"
0," Not as expected: Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a ""regular"" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it."
1, Great Book on the Best Computer: This is a great book on the inventor of the Apple Computer. I have read it several times and done a couple of book reports on it. I highly recommend it.
0, Make sure product is for your GPS: I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX
0, Garmin 276C Power Cord: The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
0, THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO: THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO
1, Great gift Idea--they love it!: I bought this for my grandson who loves NCIS. He was so tickled. He is collecting the series.
1, another good season for an already great show: this is a solid season with several great episodes. the characterization is some of the best. it's not quite the same as we've lost Kate and gained Ziva
1, 3rd season of NCIS: This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
0, Very disappointed: The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
1, Season 3 is great!: Continuing right where Season 2 left off with the murder of Agent Todd
1, A feast for the ears: I have had this album
1, Law: Gives a great overall view of this modern type career for both men and women. Provides the nuts and bolts of the career.
0, Terribly Dissappointed: I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait
1, Great flick: I took my father to see this movie in theaters back when it was released in the 70's. He was a Marine who served in the Pacific and told ne how important this battle was. I needed to have it in my collection.
1, Close...: This is a close fictionalized movie of the beginning of WWII. It is interesting and a great flick to share.
0, terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
1, Great flick: Good movie
0, Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version: If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
1, Midway: I have never received this item. It was first mis-delivered (not to me) and never arrived. Now
1, Midway: Very well done. Both on the part of the Japanese war plans
0, Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo'
1," A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage ""Tora Tora Tora"" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in ""Midway"". It's not like they took scenes made for ""Tora Tora Tora"" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit"
0, I had a great expectation for this...: What would you get if you took a bad script
1, the best: its the best music i have heard in some time. if you are in to world music or just looking for some thing diferent 
1, Intense
0," Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless ""dusk till dawn"" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's"
1, Excellent Look into African American History: I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work.
0, n/a: Who is Joe Nickell? What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?
0," Set of 2 40"" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba"
0, Cheap
1, Christmas present: Love these practice swords I have purchased some before and my son just plain wore them out. These are for Christmas and I already know he will love them...
1, Victum Of Sinility: Ironically
1, Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up
1, A classic of its kind: This movie is a classic of its kind and much better that a lot of movies
0, WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED
0, Based On A True Story?: Based on a true story? If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy. Did anyone witness this woman being raped? People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men. They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands? I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before. You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him. This is sexist and sick.
0, 0 STARS: Talk about rubbish...you want to talk about rubbish?: Be honest people
0, Has live grain bugs: I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.

0, Discover a beautiful region of France: If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer
1, Awesome: I had a lot of trouble finding this C D. I look over the internet for couple of hours until I came upon Amazon. Not only did I find what I was looking for
1, LOve it!: I have really curly
0, disappointed: i loved the original poster i lost due to a move
0, Not a Great Book: I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
1, Finally
0, Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly
0, Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy
0, not worth it: If you have never used a flat iron before
1, Works well for thick hair if you have the time...: I have really thick shoulder length hair. I only wash my hair twice a week and once my hair is dry and straightened
1, Conair Straightener: I have very thick
0, Does not perform the functions advertised.: This hair dryer claims to style
0, Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks. When I went to use it the third time
0, Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect
0, Baffled: I ordered it
0, Disappointing at best: Sadly
1, Love this thing!!: I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product
1, Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use
0, Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin
1, Great ink!: A few weeks ago
0," Structurally sound but: This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3"" and expand to 5"" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3"". So as long as these two items are not an issue"
0, Immoral movie: This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However
1, Entertaining tribute: The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and
0," They changed the words!: Don't buy this one either ... Unless you like grooving to the wrong words. I thought I was going to be sent back to the good old days ... Save your money. You won't get a refund! You can't call anyone. I got it ""DRY""!"
0, poor product: I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
0," she's so dull: She started out as the ""German Britney Spears"" and somehow she got stuck there. Her songs have no message"
1, It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.
1, applied the knowladge: i have read this book with a great deal of intrest. it was a great help in implementing change and designing a organization structure that is able to deliver on the new strategy.
1, akjee: the book covers very detailed instructions for the beginners to understand and follow the psychic healing.i have yet to practice and experiance the process
0, A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However
0, forgive me.............: Ok
1, cursing in this 80's hit movie: For those who jest cant get over the part that there was some cursing in this 80's hit movie please consider that there's was more of that in the live action movie. The same live action movie that you took your stupid little brats to see!!!!!.... get over it! i bet you freak out when bugs bunny dress in Drag too!
1," MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video ""The Touch"" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated ""Optimus Prime"" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra."
1, Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries
0, Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!: This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X
1, One of the most beautiful creation
1, Best movie ever: I happy with this purchas it a used product but came in realy good condition I thought it took a lil long to get here but notice that it was from Canada understood why it took a lil while but worth the wait
1," The Decepticons Learn A New Skill: HOW ODD!!!!! just as it really counts the decepticons learn to aim straight managing to wipe out five of the original transformers in one go after numerous attempts. Much as this film is very very good and the music is outstanding. But it has as always all the same tramsformers inconstincies. But much to all our pleasure it has all the wounderful and debonair wit of Starscream that we have all come to know and love and with Leonard Nimoy adding a nice ""Edge"" to Galvatron... Still all in all a Very Good Purchase."
1, Very Good: I saw this in the movie theather. It rocked then and it still rocks. The story line is superb. The charactors are well written. The violence might scare some young ones. After I saw this movie I never stopped talking aobut it. I highly recommend it!
1, A blast from the past!: Unlike many things I used to like and am rediscovering to find I dont like as much
0," disappointed by this board game: I bought this game because it promised a ""green"" experience for the entire family. i must say"

0, this movie is available on iTunes!!!: it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
1, Clear
0, I have such a Tooth-Ache: This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it
0, Unsatisfactory: I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately.
1, a thriller of what if times meet.: very creative and well-made thriller.it is surprising viewers.when u leave cinema(or closes dvd/video/vcd)u are thinking it is worth paying 2 $(or renting or buying).for third dimension flick-buffs.
1, Intelligent and heart-wringing: This is one of the few satisfying movies I can remember seeing. Apart from loving Dennis Quaid
1, Illogical But Wonderful: Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie
1, Fun Science Fiction: This movie is a feel good
0, FRequency: Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense
1, A great character!: Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers
1, Enjoyable book: I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times. I wanted to read the book and I'm glad I did. It was enjoyable.
1, excellant: this bok was recommed to me by my daughterinlaw
0, The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys
1, Solitary Witch: I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one
1, LOVE: Love. Love. LOVE this book! It has basically everything. Like a wiccan/ pagan dictionary. Of course You wouldnt read it from cover to cover. You could. But i wouldnt suggest it. But thats good! it means theres tons upon tons of info! It's great!
1, Our favorite game
0, If you buy this
0, Tank top: I am very unimpressed by this product. Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made. After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
0," Worthless: Doesn't fit the average 10"" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround"
0, You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy
0, Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...: I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout
0, Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ
0, Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war 
1, Lee plays the good guy!: This has to be one of the finest of the Hammer collection. Lee is piercing in his role as the Duc De Richelieu. There are occultists galore and it's up to Lee and his pal to save the son of a friend and his lover from the eternal grip of the creepiest villan Hammer studios ever unleashed. You must see this movie in widescreen! The visual created by director Terrence Fisher
0, merlin: not that good. script for moviewhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better
0, Did not speak to me
1, The Court Jester: Danny Kaye was a gifted comic actor who not only touched and entertained millions of children
0, Worst film ever?: By film's end
0, Horrible: I am only 14 years old. I would think that a movie like this would have an impact on someone my age. It didnt. It nearly put me to sleep. It was the biggest waste of money in my life. I just bought it today and am throwing it away today also.All this movie offers is an inaccurate portrait or teens
0, Yuck
1, This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.
1, Great movie?: This movie was pretty good
1, excellent movie: This movie depicts the real lives of teens grouwing up in nyc. I live in nyc and i have seen all of this going on. The only way to protect todays youth is to scare the hell out of them with movies like this.
1," Real-life look into the life of teens: This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these ""KIDS"". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens."
1," dream: I remember when I thought this film was controversial lol that is until I saw ""Bully"" Anyway this movie is about a boy who is obsessed with (...) girls and well all the kids lives are pretty much full of drugs and sex. Good ending"
1," Not A KIDS Movie: Being a teen boy I wanted to see this movie for all the hot chicks. To my disappiontment there wasn't any. Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce ""Casper"""
1, Nice Debut: Saw these guys open for Butch Walker in Boston a couple months ago and they played a nice set. Since I liked what I heard I picked up the album. Good stuff
0, Pretty but not made well: They are not fitted. They are very puffy and baggy. Do not fit at all like they are suppose to.
0, something u would'nt expect: this movie is terrible. charectors are weak and the plot just plains sucks on white bread. if anything
1, Our Father Abraham: Our Father Abraham: Jewish Roots of the Christian FaithA book every Christian should read. We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior
0, Never got it
0, BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood
0, Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards: A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
0, It was very wordy and the worst book I have ever read: Seriously
1, Love it!: The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
1," Never becomes passe!: I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to ""dazzle you with her footwork"". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there."
0, Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection
0, Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy
0, Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books
1, What's the fuss about Jane Austen?: I'm so sorry
0, Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen
1, Great Book!: This may very well be my second favorite Jane Austen book. The plot is ingenious
0, I Hate Emma: I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
0, Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book
1, Austen sparkles as always
0, Rubbish: What rubbish.Way too much violence. Why do kids movies have to be so violent these days? (or when it was made).Had a few laughs (I'm an ex-pat Australian) but not worth the plastic it was made from.Certainly not recommended for general viewing as the cover shows.
1," Bernard and Miss Bianca Do It Again!: In Disney's ""The Rescuers Down Under"
1," cave twins review from grandkids.: Or rather my Granddaughters love it. Recommended to them by Grandma who has fond memories of reading it when she was their age. The feedback from Heidi ( to whom it was sent ) was "" Wow Wicked Brilliant !"""
0, Incorrect information in this book: I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant.
0," Negative review - too basic and not too helpful: The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits. We both felt this book was too basic and we did not get helpful information. We go to monthly meetings for investors in our county and this is one of the books on the ""don't buy"" list on our bulletin board!"
1," A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors!: This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ"
0, This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.
0, Garbage - Avoid: The dimensions indicate 1/4 inch which would be fine except it is apparently the FOLDED dimension. Give me a break!
0," freely available: Since those responsible for this animated version of ""Animal Farm"" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954)"

1, The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so
1, i love this book: this is an amazing book with great action and is a pageturner with a great plot and lots of supense.
1, Great book: Very enjoyable you can never stop because this book is filled with suspends and cold hangers this was a great book
1, A great book!: I'm sorry to give you this late response because I read this book today. This was an excellent book! I would recommend everyone to read this book. This book inspired me about not giving up on your goal.
1, ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS ON EARTH!!!!!: I recommend this book to any person on the face of the earth! This book is great for cat lovers
1, Great!: Oh
1, LOVE IT!!: Okay
1, AMAZING: As soon as I started reading this book I was hooked. Erin Hunter did a fabulous job capturing the readers intrest and keeping them interested. Even my brother (who hates cats) was compelled to read this novel.
0, plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws
0, Not worth it: After finally finishing this book
1, My Comfort Book: This book helped me raise three little boys born in two and a half years. From Diapers to trucks and fighting
0, Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources
0, Awful movie.: Amazing
1, social scientists
1," Sowell is the soul of our time: This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as ""constrained"" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position"
1, Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
1," a must have: This climbing block is excellent stablizer for frontwheel and gives it a balance. It also maintains height of front wheel. I never "" stacked "" more than one because I never ordered more because of expence. I did not use it for climbing"
0, they are posers: i bet you 10$ that they stole destination unkown from the lyrics of ruby soho by rancid kicks there gay poopy areses there stupid punk wannabes like blink182 listen to us bombs or rancid or operation ivy or the vandals or the dropkick murphys or the clash or sublime or the casaulties
1, This is a great CD: This one of my favorite albums. If you like Green Day or Blink
1, Mest above all: Mest is the greatest band of all time
1, Destination Unknown: Destination Unknown by Mest
1, Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge
1, I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert
1, Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics
1, Kick [behind] BAND!!!!: Mest is the Best!!!! I just got there cd and i fell in love with it the first time i listened to it. This is a cd every music fan must get. the songs r kick [behind] and so r the guys. if u don't go out and buy this cd i'm going to MEST you up!!!!
1, Third and other streams: Well
0, Junk -- will flood your kitchen: Expensive and works for less than 3 years
1, This is my second time purchasing this item: I had an earlier model of this hot water dispenser for eleven years. That one had a metal container which rusted out. This newer version has a molded plastic type of water container which is definitely an improvement. I love the addition of the temperature control which the old one did not have.
1, *THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total

0, 90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this. How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one? It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear. I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.
1, Accurate: I bought this to help me when I started school to get my degree in political science and it proved to behelpful along with another book I bought for the same reason. I use them to decipher anything I am not clear on. Drink water when using this book because it's good for you
1," Mountain of contemplation: great book for those interested in orthodox spirituality. for more look for ""the way of the pilgrim"""
1, Excellent for everybody: My 8 months baby loves it!!!
1, sesame street: Kids get to give an opinion of their favorite song and why. Encourages all children to have a voice. The songs and movement gets kids up and moving. My three month old granddaughter wiggles and kicks with the tunes
1, Great historical novel: This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917
0," Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate ""How to"" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface"

1, A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses
1, i love it: I am very satisfied and I like it
0, Habent sua fata libelli: That book has a luck. It's the worst book which has ever been written. Strangely
0, Ulysses: This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish.
0, Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce
0, Italics are capitalized: Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also
0, Dirty and cheap: Can you make a cheaper case that these chips come in? The case weighs about 1 oz and is ready to fall apart. The fake felt they use disintegrates at touch leaving the chips dirty--covered in some sort of micro-fiber recycled paper dirt. The chips themselves are OK
0, not what it describe. when i actually had found out the chip is different when i had open the chip n making sure..: i'm not happy what i have order from here. Literally chip are color out ...seem like they been used. Dice are yellow even they are said to be ''new''. i had open the chips and feel there weight and they don't feel like 11.5 feel like they put a metal in between and let it be. Terrible...cards cheap plastic card. I will never by product from them again. Description is different then what i receive that all i got to say i got the picture to show it. false advertisement given out cheap piece of crap...look GROSSS
1, High quality
0, Poor Quality: The quality of the case is poor. It does not close well. And there seems to be poor structural integrity of the case. Some of the chips are dirty or damaged somehow?
0, These Shows Have All Been Edited: All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage
1, Sherman Foundations and Interval Spin: I rode the Foundations course and found that I was within my target heart rate for 24 minutes total. Instructor gives encouragement and tips for staying focused on the ride. If you turn off the lights and spin
0, There are better flash cartooning books out there!: In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12
0, Is book true?: In the very first chapter the motion picture frame of war coverage on the Roer river in Germany
1, Not Just Brokaw: I was terrifically moved by this recording
0, Don't be fooled by the preview: I saw the preview for this movie and thought it'd bepretty funny. The Napolean Dynamite scene is one of thehighlights
0, Unrated?: I'm tired of all these movies claiming to be the Unrated Version and not offering a single thing that wouldn't be included without exception in a PG-13 movie. Add to that only seven or eight decent laughs in the whole movie and I'm pretty ticked-off. Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie
0, A very
0, One of the worst out there.: Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie
0," Torture to watch: I went to see this but it was not by choice. I went on a ""field trip"" with my co-workers and this was the movie that won the vote.I am all for parodies (like ""Saturday Night Live"") but this movie went overboard. So does all the Scary Movies (I don't like these either). Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Get yourself a real ""Date Movie""."
0, always laugh at these parody movies...but not this one...: The movie was funny the first
0, Dated and Dull: This is waaay before the age of personal trainers. Not only is their a small amount of bare skin
0, Worst movie in history: Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
1, great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green
1, Tony B -- New Chairman of the Board: If Sinatra was considered the Chairman of the Board
1, Fun Family Film!: I love Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in this fun movie. The kids have an adventure living in a houseboat as opposed to living in an apartment in D.C.
1, Houseboat: This movie is a real delight. It is better than I remembered it as a child (my priorities were different). This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here. As Grants housekeeper
1, a very meaningful and entertaining movie: Saw the bachelor in the cinema
0, Not much redeeming value: I don't mind implausible stories
0, Difficult Viewing: This film is difficult to watch for many reasons. It is below average both artistically and technically. The film is a classic of its genre but for me HUSBANDS and WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE are much better as films. [Note how the excessive laughter in FACES is annoying and unrealistic whilst in HUSBANDS it is natural and enjoyable.]
1, Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.: This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album
0, Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase
0, Refund: This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen. What a waste of talent & money. One has to wonder what someone was thinking when this was made. I could only stand to watch half of it.. Don't waste your time & money.
0, Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
1, Coconutheads: I've followed The Coconutheads since the early nineties as they've performed throughout south Florida. Their live performance would make a great album too! Val and Greg have a have an almost telepathic connection on stage... their saxophonist (Nicky
1, great product: it's the best lube i've used so far
1, Good Product - Stains can be dealt with: I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with. However
0, It is greasy: I bought this because of the men's health endorsement. My wife and I used it a few times and then desisted. It's ok for intercourse but not other activities.
0, There are better lubes by FAR!: We did not like this lube. It was not slick enough for our purposes and was very watery. There are much better lubes out there for the money. It also stung per my wife
1, Love it!: i LOVED this movie! i watched it in my English class and LOVED it! it was soo beautiful and i had to buy it because it was so awesome. you never get bored
1, The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet
1, Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English
0, Romeo & Juliet: The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
1, the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance
0, But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great
0, More Groans Than Laughs: Weak
0, Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still
1, A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans
1, Love this movie!: I love that I can find the older movies here at Amazon. I have bought several from different sellers and all have been great! I just love Spenser Tracy and this old b&w is one of my FAV's
0," Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers"
0, Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels
1, Great Movie
0, Bad: The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
1, An amazing fun MOM book: This book was wonderful. I am a SAHM. I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though
0, Not the Planet of the Apes: This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film
1, Wonderful perspective shift!: After reading the Ophelia books and the studies on the many and varied problems teenage girls face
0, ???: Don't even remember watching it
0, HORRIBLE
0, Women leave for all the same reasons: I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people
0, Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second
0, pretty bad: If you loved the first one
0, This should have been a good movie...: but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens
1, The Mummy Returns: I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the 1st film.
0, Forgot to mention this...: But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way
0, the mummy returns: I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars
0, ryan hickneys mummy review: this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
0, Don't buy this DVD: Unless you want to line Universal's pocket
1, Great Special Effects: Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
0, It stunk: This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
0, What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes
1, Good short history: Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN: 1-881366-01-4170 pages
0, OK as a monocular
0, RE: Mission Impossible: By and large
0, Impossible: Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie
0, Such shit: This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget
0, I was dissappointed: Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot
1, Nice Family Drama: This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
1, Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight
1, Book was a marvel of technical details and fiction: Guy Durham masterfully tells a spy tale with grity details of the processes along the way. He includes a myriad of interesting characters and plot twists in a live-action way
0, Brittle Fail: These cases are super brittle
1, Just what I was looking for!: This book is full of many wonderful ideas on how to achieve your own 'white' space. The effect is fresh and romantic
1, Alarm works when power is out!: A lot of the battery backup alarm clocks only provide for backup of the settings. If the power is out when the alarm is suppose to go off
1, WING FLY HIGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Love this cd to bad it was the last Wings recored
1, Yes
1, Excellent: All the Nancy Drew books are excellent - perfect to develop a 8 or 9 year olds love for reading. The stories are all so interesting. We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B. Jones have main characters that I would never want my daughter to emulate with bad attitudes
1, Story of Saab as told by a European.: The author has several automotive books to his credit and it shows. In his history of this classic car
0, disturbing: We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
0, BEWARE: This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child
0, Magic Thumb Tip: The thumb is very small (more for a child than an adult) and you could not fit any cloth inside to do any type of trick. Would absolutely not recommend this product at all.
1, Meooooooooww: When I read this title I thought it was going to be a funny story but WOWWW was it so much more. This is the sexiest story I have every read. Dammmmmm
1, A classic which keeps you guessing.: The only thing really wrong with Morse is that he smokes too much. If you want a really good read in your mysteries
1, Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.: I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit
1, Yes
1, Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
1, the best: i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen. after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years
1, Riveting: Man was I upset when this thing ended after just three hours. For anyone who's ever worked in a big glass skyscraper this film is truly cathartic. I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it
0, Pretty much a waste of time: The story itself
0, Not What I Expected: This books has loads of information
1, to dream of love: This movie is unique and beautiful. Especially the character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).Still reeling from its beauty
0, The Emperor Has No Clothes: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring
1, great buy
1, My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator
1, Awsome: I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time
1, First epilator I've used: I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators
1, Looking for the perfect gift for the man who has everything?: Here it is. I purchased this for my Dad
0, To engineer is human - I engineered a new beverage coaster!: I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore
0, Save yourself the time...: The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however
0, Had SO much potential....: I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising
0, I liked the backcover blurb
0, Don't waste your money: Although they appeared to be working (they glowed
0, Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
0, Poor stitching
1, Works with AVIC-D3: The new ipods do not charge with the pioneer cable
1, (3.8)stars still good: This is not like their first two albums but it's still heavy.They don't have the deathcore they had in their first album and some of it in caitiff choir but it's still has the metalcore with brutal breakdowns and more melodic singing i guess.This is kind of like the band a day to remember just not to big with the pop thing.If you own their first two albums just know this
1, So far - très bon: AS described
0, Is it over yet?: After 4 months of trying to plow through this book
0, Crap: with all the add on to this game a simple versus DLC that allows you to play up to four or even two players in your house (split screen) would be good
1, You're Gonna This Book: This book is a must read!!!! but not unless you've read City Of Masks and City of Stars. Hoffman creates and incredible world in (unfortunately) the last installment of this AMAZING series. You'll want to stay in Talia forever. This book had the perfect combination of love
0, We Are The World meets Journey: When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
0, TV goes out after 90 days: We spent $90 on this tv. It worked fine for 95 days or so. Then the tv goes out. You push the power button and nothing happens. We have tried different outlets and everything. And guess what
1, Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X)
1, Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian
1, Love it!: This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite roles for all of the actors
1," A good collection but......: This collection features some of their hit singles plus one new track ""Desperado"""
1, After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad
1," Suprisingly enjoyable: ""Blow"" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of ""blow"" is kind of hard to figure out"
0, DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir
0, Great movie!: I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
1," Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story: The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a ""big"" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other"
0, Heavy handed: While the acting
0, Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun
0, Please no more!: The third installment of Crocodile Dundee starring a subdued Paul Hogan takes place this time in Los Angeles
0, Not the Buddy Holly I know and love: My husband bought this CD for me during a recent visit to the UK
0, Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first: This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
1, Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state. The novel makes the reader question their own lapse into the existentialist circle and why it happens. In short
1, read it for your own reaction.: This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life
1, Profound
1, L'Etranger
1, A Good Classic: I think everybody should read this who likes existentialism. it is a very quick read though. i think it would make a very great movie.
1," goth background research: ""and the stranger - the killing of an arab""It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus"
0, SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_
1, Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist
1, Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school
1, Great Book
1, Good CD dictionary that can be better: This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version
0, No support for low screen res: The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way
1, Excellent Dictionary: I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language
0, not the worse film or acting...: but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz
1, Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie
0, A Train Wreck: This film really misses its mark. Billed as a black comedy
0, 0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied: This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan
0, What a pity: Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
1, Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery
0, A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology
0, Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size
1, A great work of art: This book works on so many levels
1, exquisite: how many of us read NIGHT FLIGHT in high school as quickly as possible? my grown experience of Saint-Exupery is the opposite. i linger over every page. Saint-Exupery provides a literary meal to be savored page by page. call me an escapist but the skies over Buenos Aires never looked so good.
0, Long Winded
0, WHY???: I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL
0, Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift: I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well
0, Must be made in China: I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it
0, Cute But Poor Quality: These are charming little espresso cups but they do not hold heat for more than 2 or 3 minutes. Granted
1, This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen
0," Re-Releasing ""An Evening With John Denver"" under a different title!: If you already own ""An Evening with John Denver"" (five star album) then you don't need this one! The same program (exactly) has been repackaged with a new title and cover...less the two best songs! ""Boy From The Country"" and ""Today""...the original is fabulous but why do it again?!?!?"
1, Bang Bang Kiss Kiss: This album is great to listen to if you want to hear the begining of glassjaw. But this is just the tip of the ice berg. Demos go way back to Impossible Shot
0, No idea about this album: I ordered this album
1, prattgirl: I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material
1, Letters of the Past: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson
1, Great Story
0, YUCK!: Has James Patterson sunk so low that he's now penning drivel just for the money? Every 1-star reviewer of this book is right on
0, Pathetic Dialogue: I don't understand why people adore Patterson. His lame dialogue is beyond tedious. This one could have been written by a teenager.
0, This is Og Mandino at his worst: This is a fast read
0, absolute treacle: It's amazing that a book this bad could have been published. It consists of one maudlin cliche after another. The widowed Jennifer
0, Majorly sucked: This book was jam-packed with cliches and wooden characters and dialogue. At 236 very small pages with a bigger font than necessary
0, Just like Suzanne's Diary...: I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas
0, Tear Up the Formula: I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books
0, Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line
0, NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent
1, The Only Doo-Wop collection you'll ever need: This is a fantastic overall collection of Doo-Wop groups/songs i have heard.This covers most of the variations of songs let alone the big hits of the day many years back
0, disappointing: I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
0, Complete waste of time: I think this is the worst remake of any movie of all time. What a piece of garbage. Can't come close to original.
1, show the entire movie: Currently
0, really BAD Sony transfer.: Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night
0," Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is ""Night of the Living Dead""...The 1968"
0, Garbage: Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
0, Not for everyone: If your main objective
1, Sweet and funny
1, Adorable Fun Movie
1," Sweet Little Movie: I know that this movie got ""mixed reviews"
1, Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles
0, Not the best....: The print is great but can not find more than half of the answers for my puzzles... Tried over and over and the book is one big failure...
1, For light comic romantic entertainment
0, Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version
0, duped: I thought I was purchasing the special edition of Pinocchio--at least
1, Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection): Via Amazon - Excellent service
0, no extra features!: I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of
0, Very Dissapointed: I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
0, Pinocchio not the only one who lies!: This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
1, It's a classic !!: How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again
0, This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie
1, Pinocchio 2 Disc Anniversary Edition: This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
1, love it: Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping
1, BD-live features mostly worthless: I explored the BD-live feature for the first time last night
0, Not very good: I actually ordered two dirtbags and within a week
1, The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math
1, Love it!!: I Love this Toque! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time. Supper thick and comfy.
1, Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith
1, Good movie: Not much to say. Good story
1, Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in this society.: Very pertinent to how we raise our sons in our society. A must read by ever parent while their son is growing up. If you like this book
0, Predictable: The book may be good for people whom have little understanding of children in general. Of course boys have emotions and ofcourse they are trained not to express those. It's up to the parents to ensure that boys learn to express their emotions. I wish the book had had practical examples of how to do it
1, The classic analysis on the internal life of boys: I read most every book on this subject since I am a therapist and a parent.This is a great place to start.It might not be the most readable book but
1, A Family Comedy That Is Out Of This World.: Suburban Commando is a 1991 sci-fi action/comedy family film which stars WWE Legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan
1, Great Flick!: Loved it in the 80's
1, funny and a little scary: We watched this again after many years. It is still just as funny! Kevin Bacon is great. I love Reba in it too.
1, Good Entetainment: Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which
1," Awesome Picture!!!: Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the ""Picture Quality"" on the ""Tremors"" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome."
1, Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art
0, Quite possible the worst movie of all times. 0 stars: This movie [stinks]. The story is nothing like the original
0, Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to
0, Received a used set: Nothing fundamentally wrong with it
0, A disappointment!: Having made the change to Veganism recently
1, Seitan Quickly: Cookbook on Cooking with Seitan was in excellent condition and arrived very promptly. The book itself wasn't all I had hoped--too many weird ingredients that I can't begin to find--but that is NOT the fault of Amazon or the bookseller who sent the order.
0, Damaged goods: While my sister was extremely excited about the glasses I got her has a gift
0, Screens wore out quickly: The screens on this product wore out very quickly and are $20 to replace which is almost the cost of the entire product at $35. Everything else seems fine.
0, Very disappointed: This is a set book for the University course I'm following. To be honest
0, Not her best: I love Virginia Henley but these characters are so disconnected and unromantic. There is simply nothing endearing about any of the players in this book
0, insipid: this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. Read something substantial for a change!
1, A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall
0, Neighbor's Dog Liked it More than I thought...: I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected

1, good overall toy: this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast
0," There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about ""breaking with reality"""
1, Wow!: We had heard about this item (and the many similar items) and decideded that we'd give it a try. Wow! We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent
1, Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
1, Excellent edition of the book: This is an excellent edition of the book
1, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (kindle): All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film
1, This is the Muhammad Ali of books
1, Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers
1, Kinda wish I had read the longer one!: This is BY FAR
0, Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo
1, The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly
1, The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next
1, The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.
1, Superb
0, Terrible
1, Excellent: Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that.
0, Abridged version
0, Horrible: Don't waste your time reading this edition. There are many grammatical errors in this edition. Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book.
1, Great story of redemption: Sweet revenge at it's finest.Love
0, Thumbs down: The first time I watched these years agoI liked them. Today they seem a little outdated??Just did not enjoy them really. Thumbs down.
1, breath of fresh air: For the Love of Children
1, This book would make a great Mother's day gift!: This book was given to me. I read it and placed it on my book shelf. As a writer
1," Highly recommended baby doll!: This laughing calin doll is perfect for young toddlers. She is small and light enough to be carried around easily. Her expression is very pleasant. She is the perfect ""play Mommy"" doll. She appears very well made and durable."
1, This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first
1, IT WAS THE BEST!!!: IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS ROMANTIC AS WELL AS EXCITING. NOTHING COULD EVER TOP IT. PATRICK SWAYZE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE WORLD AND JENNIFER GREY WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO.
0, Ordered for Christmas but...: Ordered for delivery for Christmas but after order was told it would not be delivered by Christmas. It was confirmed at purchase time to be delivered before Christmas. Now I have to go back out and find it in a store and then try and return this one to Amazon. Not much fun...
1, One of the best movies ever made!!: This movie is the best one I have ever seen. I have the soundtrack and it's great too. The story
1, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!: I always thought this was a lame movie
1, I love this movie!: Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are the terrific duo in this dancing romance on the road! I love the song Baby
1," sexy/thoughtful: this album especialy the tittle cut remedy makes me think that he really knows how woman want to be treated. keep up the good work we really need ""brothas"" out there that still think like you."
1, 8701-Usher!: This cd is HOT ... I love it. One of my favorite Usher cds ever! Has several hits... One of his best ever! Must have for the fan of Usher! I am happy to have it for my own collection! Its great from start to finish!
1," LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!: Usher's ""8701"" is one of the best R&B albums I have EVER purchased. EVERY SONG on this album is beautiful. I always like Usher but with this album.....I'ma die-hard fan! He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them ""I love you"". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are ""U remind me"""
0," who would have thought..: that this cute little guy by the name of Usher who came out with the awesome ""My Way"" would grow up to be an arrogant womanizer with about as much originality as Britney Spears. Grow up Usher. Be a man. You either have the talent/personality/ and originality or you don't. Leave r & b and go be one of Brit's back up dancers."
1, 2nd BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!: Second to NSYNC'S
1, usher was creative then: now THIS is the usher I liked who actually released good music instead of that stale let it burn and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. He was on fiyah in summer 2001 till 2002 with his blazing hot videos and being himself with a little bit of michael jackson influence instead of trying to be his minime like he does all the time today and not even be close to dancing as great.
0, Don't Bother: A horrible movie which makes Dull & ordinary (with the exception of sex) one of the most complex writers/individuals that Ireland has produced. If cinematography alone is your sole requisite in a film by all means buy the DVD. One good aspect of the movie; Ewan & Susan Lynch's rendition of 'The Lass of Aughrim'...but you can download that.
0, ewan mcgregor's hot: although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly
1, Riveting Reading!: Fast paced
0, good for a b-day prsent?: my brother loves these game. )hes favorite is the one for computer but we lost the disk when i was in kindergarten) when this comes out tell me how great it is!
0, TERRIBLE
1," Fast moving police drama: This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character (""Popeye"" Doyle).This is good police drama and quite entertaining."
1, Timeless
1, THE BEST CRIME MOVIE EVER MADE!: French Connection is a exciting action/crime film starring Gene Hackman as Popeye Dole
1, THE FRENCH CONNECTION: DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER
0, inadequate disclosure: Received the book in a timely fashion but the CD-ROM and the Timeline were NOT included. This should have been clearly stated in the listing! The Timeline was to be a 60th birthday present for my twin sister.
0, Low quality sound: The volume is low and even with my Tv turned all the way up I can barely hear it : (
1, THE REAL PLAYAS: TWO PLAYAS PLAYING HARD TO GET WITH EACH OTHER MORRIS CHESTNUT AND VIVICA A. FOX PLAY GAMES WITH EACH OTHER . THIS IS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST GAME I ENJOYED IT AND I LIKED IT A LOT. IF YOU LIKE COMEDY AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
1, GREAT resource!: I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
1, AWESOME!: Awesome guide! The best as finally been put out for a reference price guide on the best ever movie star MARILYN MONROE! Even she would be amazed I bet! Terrific job! Thanks for all the hard effort in making it! All worth it!
1, Crystal Growing Science Kit: This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child
0," I never thought Meryl Streep could give a ""bad"" performance.: I never thought that Maryl Streep could give a bad performance. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress from Sopjie's Choice and The French Lt.'s Woman. Oh"
0, Okay !!!!: This movie was okay
0, Too drawn out!: I usually enjoy reading this author however that was not the case in this particular title. The plot was too drawn out.
1, Hilarious: This movie was even funnier than the first. I love how they brought back characters from the first movie and continued storylines. Definitely recommended
0, Not quite...: Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments
0, Worthless!: They peeled off within a week. I cleaned the tub; wiped it down with alcohol and even put a heater in it for a couple hours to warm up the surface. I did everything I could to insure they would adhere well
0, I really don't recommend this product.: Purchased this a while back
0, drying and sticky: I didn't care for this product at all. I found that it dried out my hair and was also very sticky. I will not purchase again...
1, This book is possibly the best I've ever read.: This book is extraodinary. I started reading it expecting it to be boreing. After the first eight pages
0, A story as lush as the planet it is set on!: Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't
0, A Great Book
0, predictable: After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after.
0, It;s just not very good: I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune
1, You won't regret: Simply the best novek I have read. This not just a sci-fi novel. The world created by Herbert can only suit a envoirement in future. The story starts somehow complicated but soon you will discover the intelligence of the author. If you haven't read it yet
1, Brief
1, The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written
1, The best book I ever read: Dune is the best book I ever read. I know it is not a good argument to persuade you
0, Great writing - poor publishing: ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print & editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous
0," Do yourself a favor and don't open it!: I rather liked ""Dune"" but this poor excuse for a sequel is just plain awful! When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series"
0, Sorry
1, Read the Series: I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two
1, DUNE ...Best Science Fiction Book I have ever read!: Of course that is just what every other review thinks but hell it's the truth! I picked this book up from my girlfriends brother for a school report... (yeah i don't read muchy for my enjoyment) but anyway i read it and now i want more. This book has got me reading for the hell of it and i am purchasing Dune Messaih and Children of Dune and can't wait to read them. Dune changed my outlook on reading with it's indept look at politics
1, A Lifetime Favorite: I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give.
0, Kindle version: I have climbed out of bed to write this for you
0, Embarrassing Ebook: After reading the Kindle sample of this book
1, DUNE is the book for our time: I was only 4 years old when I first saw the screen version of this book and then I was hooked. Granted I shouldn't have gotten interested in the book just because of the movie
0, What was the point of this book again?: This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done
1, No doubt about it!: One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice
1, Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!
1, Interesting continuation.: Like dune
1," just a few steps to total enlightenment: 1. Read the book during the summer-time2. Download the song ""Final Dream"" from the 80s movie ""Dune""3. Immerse yourself in water and/or listen to the song.4. Break out in tears.This book will change your life forever. :)"
1, Dune: Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read. The technology in the book seemed to be extremely none feasible to the recent human culture thst sorrounds us as a people. The story of the chosen one
1, Just the Best: Honestly
1, Not the best book ever
0, An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me
1, Warm and self sacrificing: Jane and Tom meet fall in love and there are many obstacles to overcome. Different ending bittersweet. Loved it. Will not tell all as it will ruin the movie.
0, Horribly Disappointing: First
1, Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works
1, GREAT MOVIE: Anne Hathaway did a great job as Jane Austin and this movie stayed very true to her real life (what we know of it anyway).
0," Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no ""Mrs. Brown."" It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless."
1, one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read
1, Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play
1, My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre
1, Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it
1, Day-Timer stand: I was tired of having to pick up my Day-Timer every time I wanted to view it
0, So where's the rest of it????: I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately
0," a sorry bit of commercialism: I should have known better after the ""Rose Red"" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that "
1, Great toy! Great service!: I ordered this for my daughter because she lost her other 'Scat' beanie baby. It is a very durable toy. The order came quickly in the mail and in very good shape.
0, Fuel Pump: Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly
0, Plays but is noisy: This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD's are played. Terrible fast forward and backwards
0, This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted: I started reading it
0," Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam: The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
0, Not a hero.: Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months
0, Campaign for Kerry: To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics
0, Waste of time and money: This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies
0," Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias: The following disclaimer appears on the ""Unfit for Command"" Swift boat book:""Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example"
1, Liberals Read This Book!: A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York
1, what a world: A friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I have to admit it was way beyond anything I ever imagined. I have practically worn the CD out listening to it and hanging on every surreal nuance within the deep lyrics and the haunting music. Being a sax player myself
1, Chilling!: I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death
0, Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker
0," Misleading information: I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading (""GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver."" An initialism is hardly ""slang"") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to ""save batteries."" Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car"
1, A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying
1," This is one funny movie!!: This movie is hilarious!! I found it amazing because this film was truely a pionear of its genre(parody). This was before Lethal weapon and even before the movie ""Clue"" it is indeed one of the first of its kind.It follows the same basic premise as most other murder mystery movies but it turns all of the stereotypes on their head.For example-The butler is blind and this is but one many things that make this movie unique. You can tell the producer and director had a lot of fun making this one.The first time you watch it you can have a dozen different guesses for how the movie turns out but you will not be right. I love this movie!!"
1, personal top #10: If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
1, Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out
0, Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy
0, <*** This movie is BAD! ****>: I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions
0," Top 10 reasons you saw ""XXX"": 10.You're a girl that has a crush on Vin Diesel 9.You're a kid that has no idea who James Bond is. 8.You're a serious movie goer looking for comedy relief. 7.You thought it was rated XXX. 6.You're a student from the USC film class ""Bad Movies 101"". 5. You had nothing better to do with your time and money. 4.You're a first-time moviegoer that was tricked by your 15-year-old sister. 3.You're a critic that's in hot water with his boss. 2.You believe that the WWF and WCW is a real sport. 1.That Vin Diesel guy is hot even if he can't act."
1, Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!: There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment. It's just that simple. If you're looking for profound
0, Mindless
0, head for the XXX-it: I've only ever walked out of one movie
0, Unleaded: Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean
0," Triple Bad!!!: This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond"
0, HORRIBLE!!!!!!: Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious
1, Good introductory real options book for beginner or manager: It is a good introductory book on real options targeted at the audience of managers rather than experienced financial practitioners. Its contents covered financial options
1, An American Classic: Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job
1, Captivating: Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice
0, deplorable: this was the worst example of american literature ever published. warren feels the need to describe such trivial objects as doorknobs
0, Pointless: This book was profane and pointless
1, Extremely unappreciated: This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics
0, Thou Preachest Too Much!: This book has a preachy tone that current readers will find hard to take but at the core of this book there are useful truths and insights into the learning process. For the good student
1," Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!: I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a ""well-reasoned"""
1, This is a great album
1, say YES to THE STONES: THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
0, the same thing.....: The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries
0, YUK..............: Are they still alive? This CD stinks!!!! They are living off Media Baby Boomers Hype!!! When was the last time they had a hit 1970?
0, What a Bunch of Trash!: I have been patiently waiting for some new Stones and what do I finally get
0, Oh
0, This CD reminds me of a not good CD: I was definately not ready for the disappointment I suffered when I decided to buy this instead of another Tom Waits CD. I was very sorry to see that the early music by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies was just as god-awful as all the other alternative music that I hate.I like mittens!
1, Another winner: Another winner for Jance in the Joanna Brady series. I have read all of the books in the series and am currently reading the next installment
1, TL!: Bought this cd many
0, OK
0, Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school
0, thumbs down: All the children magically popping up
1, Improves with age...: I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment
1, Joseph ...: All I have to say is that I love it! The music is awesome
1, Best Musical of All Time: Nothing better than learning a Bible Lesson through so much entertainment. I wish there were more DVD's out like this. Enjoy!
1, Can't get enough!!!!!: I have seen a few broadway shows in the past
0," Can we say ""overproduced""?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production"
0, Not for Children: Donny Osmond was wonderful as always
1, Joseph and the Amazing Tecno Dreamcoat is the best!: I have wanted to see this musical for the last year
1, The whole family enjoys it!: I saw Joseph for the first time about 4 years ago
1, Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version
1, Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD
0, Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated
1, I really like: the story being told. The actors are pretty good and they can definitely sing. The biggest reason I purchased this DVD is the singing.
1, A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art
0, Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge
1, Some people...: This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses
1, Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot
0, Stuff is great but don't buy here: Cha Cha Mix is definitely tasty
1, Awesome.... for the year that it was made: Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very good movie... What really got me was the fact that it was based on a true story. TCM#1 was the best out of all of them. #4 was the Lamest of all of them...but opinions vary.
0, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However
1, THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie
1, THE SAW IS FAMILY.: I remember when i was about ten watching this movie the one thought i couldn't get out of my mind is that this [stuff] really happend. From the moment that creepy guy jumps in there van and starts talking about how he worked in a slaughter house and then starts cuttin on his self the movie has your attention. I really dont know what else to say that hasn't allready been said so i just want to say love this DVD. 5/5.
0, Widescreen yes
1, so scary: im young and this movies scared me for years i never have gone or looked at any supodley abandod houses very creepy a true horror film.
1, Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days
1, Good
1," The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark masterpiece debut ""THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life"
0, DUMB DUMB AND DUMB: this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC
0, Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle
0, Despite great acting by De Niro
0, All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store
1, Top Notch: This film is shot well
1, Great!: When I was a little kid. I would try to watch these movies but they really freaked me out. Now that im 15 I had to give this one a try. Freddy's Dead was on television and once I saw one part with Freddy and Carlos(Carlo's ear) it freaked me out
0, this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all
0, What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp. Robert Englund was happy to make this I'm sure
1," ""He's Back!"": Three years after the apparent death of the striped sweater wearing madman"
1, good: this is a really great movie it might even be the best in the series even if the first one in like this classic.
1, Queen of Hell: I only saw about a third of this movie
1," Re-Discover Your Music Collection!: This is a fantastic product! I am NOT a ""technical"" guy"
1," National Geographic ""Africa"" Series: Beautifully photographed. However"
1, If this CD doesn't perk you up
1, Damm Good Swing Cd.: This is a damm good swing cd. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that its Ska. There are only traces of Ska in tracks such as Dr Bones
0, You call this swing?: Listen up all you people who think you know swing. This ain't nothin'! This isn't swing
1, This cd will make you want to get up and swing dance.: The songs are full of catchy phrases and brilliantly made. The Cherry Poppin' Daddies picked all the right hits to be on the album especially my favorite
1, Zoot Suit Riot is the best song on the album.: This album is pretty good...not as good as I had hoped. Zoot Suit Riot is definitely the greatest song on the album
0, Wasn't very impressed
1," THE best album of 1998. Period.: The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. ""Zoot Suit"" is the best CD of the year. On stage"
1, oh yeah: with the great beat good lyrics and skilled players they are simply the best
0, Awful stuff: I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
0, Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix: These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s
0, There's much better modern swing out there...: The swingin' sounds on this may rock
1, Absolutely Love Hoku!: I bought Hoku's CD years ago. I didn't even know who she was but I was young and pretty much bought any CD. I am now almost 18
0," Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!: Hoku's ridicousily stupid ""Another Dumb Blonde"" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde."
0, Another dumb blonde: Although she might say she's not
1, Great CD!: Excellent music that carries a fantasic sense of Place. To my knowledge
1, still the best: This album is awesome. I love the song Dive. This song kinda reminds me one of the songs that I used to sing in my church youth group. He always sings how a true christian (or should I say disciple) should feel. Especially in the song The Change. I saw him in concert in California. I was sixteen years old. The feeling that I had while I was at that concert was the best. I own all his albums. He never disapoints me. He is the main reason I listen to Christain music.
0, Building the Custom Home Office: This has to be the worst book I have ever seen on the subject. 154 pages dealing with ONE home office layout/concept. AND this is from 2002. Very difficult to get ideas as it deals with one outdated office concept and explains how to build the components from scratch. In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.
1, A cornerstone in brass-band funk: I first got this album in 1992. I was immediately hooked. This album is a cornerstone of music that the dirty dozen brass band have helped bring back to the spotlight. One of my all time favorites.
1, Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok: Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
0, the great queen seondeok: the story line is perfect the cast and choreogophy are great but the dvd's suck out of the first 20 chapters only 5 have had no problems and i lost have of the story line
1, Writers
0, their lesbian schtick is running thin: god
1, THE MOST ENJOYABLE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be one of the most amazing cd's ever! Britney Spears only wishes she could make music like this. Great pop beats with meaningful lyrics align all the songs here.Coming from someone who loves Madonna
1, Tatu - Russian Music comes to the USA: Folks
1, These girls are definetely gonna get you!: Talk about amazing. These girls are definetely worth listening to. A couple months ago my friend talked me into downloading one of their songs. I caved in and did so. I listened to just a little clip of them
0, Not worth it - taped @ extended/super-long play & inaudible.: Inaudible particularly for Gollum's talking and some of the songs. Glitches appear in the taping including soem sections where the sound drops off for a second in the middle of a sentence. Not re-digitized. Not worth it. Perhaps other reviews refer to a different version of the movie.
0," didn't see it yet but not buying it: It is not fair to call this a ""review"" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie"
0, Great cartoon
0," over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance: seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read ""the hobbit"
0, Missing sounds... how annoying: For the first time in my life
0, The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie
0," MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie"
1," Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by "" Orson Bean"") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon "" Smaug"". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with "" Return of the King"""
0, TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not
0, Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off
1, A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall
0, Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version
0, Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately
1, Now thats what I call a bible: Fantastic - it arrived yesterday
0, PRINT SIZE IS 6.2 NOT 9.5: I HAD TO RETURN MINE DUE TO INACCURATE DESCRIPTION6.2 IS UNREADABLE FOR ME
1, Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift
0, Caution before downloading: The Kindle Touch version has been problematic for me. I can find no Table of Contents
0, Tiny Font: I bought the ESV single column legacy imitation leather Bible based on the stated font size of 9 points. When I received the Bible I could barely read the text even with reading glasses. I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.
1, Good
1, Great for Gifts!: Super handy and looks legit
0, Too long: The book is too long and contains some unnecessary kill-crazy parts. Certainly good for historical reference but I wouldn't reccomend this as a source of spiritual or even moral inspiration.
1, Yamaha ipod dock: Easy to connect
0, Still have not received it: I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September
0, Could have been better.: I'm sorry to say I read about half of it until I gave up and skipped to the end and partially read the last chapter.I dont know what it was about the book that just didn't keep me hooked. Thankfully I got it from the library so it didn't cost me anything.Hopefully Sigaloff's next book will entertain me more.
0, This film had a point to make
1, Great Remote Mount Radio: This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have
1, Inspired movie!: I saw this movie on TBN channel last night and it was good. To the previous reviewer and anyone who is interested
1, Can I give it 10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK
0," Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins"
0, you gotta know when to fold em Kenny: Ugh! Kenny Rogers doing a Whitney Houston ballad? He doesn't have the voice for any of these songs. Stick to what you know Kenny.
0, Short Summary: These guys look like a couple of crackheads (especially the one on the left). Sad how they are being paid for this garbage. I guess a Jr. High School diploma and knowing your drugs gets you far in the ATL. Enjoy being rich and ignorant.
0, Breathtaking cinematography
0," Basically ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" With Different Ethnicity: Would have given it a 1-star"
0, Impassioned Drudgery: This movie
0, nibbling on kelp: Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet
1, Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie
0, A True Stinker: Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film
0, Great Work Of Fiction: Its a shame this book fails in its promise to expose a conspiracy but it makes for some good fiction. The author seems to feel that FDR was a communist and the reason he allowed Pearl Harbor to be attacked is to spread communisim around the world.I was left confused and bewilderd by Mr. Willey's arguments as most of the evidence presented was taken out of order or mixed and matched to fit his argument.

0, Unable to return miss labled Stearns Rearm Kit: We have five SoSpenders inflatable PFDs model number 38APRO and ordered five rearming kits#0944 which state on the package that they fit the SoSpenders 38APRO PFD. The water sensitive bobbin in the kits does not fit the PFD and when we attempted to return the kits in the original packages to Amazon they would not accept them saying that they can not accept shipping of items that have gas in them. It is strange that they can ship to us items that have gas in it but we can not ship the same product in the original unopened package back to them. Now we are stuck with $120.00 worth of rearm kits that are of no use to us. Our recomendation is DO NOT USE AMAZON as they are a company that does not admit it has a miss labled or improperly packaged product.
1, Algebra: Structure and Method Book 1 (California Edition): No marks that I have found yet. All pages seem to be there. Cover is good. In fact
0, I'm happy my order was canceled: After reading several reviews
1, GREAT MOVIE: I'm not sure why people have been giving this movie such low ratings. I highly recommend the DVD version. The artistic effects were absolutely brilliant! Although the story tends to drag on at times and the acting could have been better
0," Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in ""her voices.""Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story"
0, Miscast: This movie was 100% perfect
0," well.....it was okay: i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have ""joan of arc"" the savior of the republic of france"
1, Very historical: This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But
0, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History
0, Great music
1, Fantastic Book: A wonderfully written book. A superb plot. Great characters. Interesting setting. A classic. A must read. One of my 10 favorite works of fiction. Maybe even better than Shogun!
0, Never got the book and it's been a month...: I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
1, My kids love to read this over and over: I have 3 boys
0, not as good as i was hoping: when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not
1, Mac cover: I bought this for my buddy. He had looked at one
1, Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford
1, The kids loved it!: Stuart Little is one of those nice films that you can drag out on a rainy winters' day
0," Charlotte's Web is better! OH MY SWEET TEMPLETON!: CHARLOTTE'S WEB IS BETTER BECAUSE THE MOVIE HAD TEMPLETON IN IT. (TEMPLETON IS MY BOYFRIEND)! SO.. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW: ""RATS ARE BETTER THAN MICE!"" STUART LITTLE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE RAT ON CHARLOTTE'S WEB! IF YOU THINK MY REVIEW IS HELPFUL"
1, Adoption message: This is a fun
1, A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!: This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!)
0, suartlittle: they don't talk about funny stuffsthey don't pretend to be dead.They don't go fast with a car.Can't put them to a jail.Can't have a hot rideCan't go full blast with a car
0, not necessarily for kids: My two young children enjoyed watching this movie
0, Too bad no one read the book: This movie called Stuart Little because its title character is a mouse
1, A somewhat entertaining historical account: Given my odd sense of humor
0, George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be
0, Not very good: I'm not a huge fan of Medieval literature
1, good: I am very satisfied with the product
0, dated...: 'Cheap and cheerful' is how I'd describe this book. Which means there are better
0, okay
0, Complete Waste of time / Film: The premise seemed alluring... saving the world in secret by use of time travel to the future... But nothing makes much sense in this movie. all of The charactors can't think past their nose. What drives them on? oh yeah their unknown B actors getting paid to play in a truly pathectic Sci-Fi... Like most reviewers I tend not to write about somthing that really just sucks
1, Everything is better with Jello!: Good to hear that there is someone out there that's popular in the clubs......but maintains a message and logic. Unfortuanatly I'm sure most of the fans don't have a clue as to what half there songs are about. Not unlike Dead Prez
0, Bad Book!!!: This book was bad..... in organization
1, Remember children
0, barely useful: Flimsy construction
0, Could have been better: I bought this book for the unique spreads and read it thoroughly. I would have liked to see explanations for why the cards are laid out in certain order and places. I thought the questions were too specific and would be difficult to answer with numerous cards. Interesting spreads
1, Great product. UI could be improved: I've had this product for at least six years. I love the functionality. We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However
1, Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR 102 is a terrific radio
0, Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries

0, OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT
0, Like the idea behind the phone but not this one: this is my second cordless phone with a headset-this one I can not hear out of. I contacted the seller Rainbow Barter and they said all sales were final. So I tried to contact IBM sat on the phone 25 minutes the first time on hold
0, Broken Bottle: Ordered this set for my grandma
0, Chiefs: I got a VHScopy that did not work on my video player.I was able to return to the sender.I would have liked to get the new DVD copy but found it too costly.It was a good tv series and book and Isaw it quite a long time ago.It's to bad that the cost is high.Ron
0, Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However
0, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me
1, A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author
0, I didn't really like the book it was boring
0, very different book: i think that this book was very diffent. and that it was very hard to understand. most of the book i wasnt really sure what was going on just that he was magical and that he was in the past. there was definitly a twisted ending but thats ok. if i had a choice i probably wouldnt have read this book and read a different book on the list but oh well i got the pages i needed out of it.

1, As expected: I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected
1, This guy was evil: This book shows you that Bob was a womanizer
1, good for the tackle box: I got this as a gift for my 10 year old nephew who loves to go fishing. He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.
0, thank you: This one gift I could give my grown daughter. I read this book over and over to her as a child. It was in wonderful condition!
0, One Star
0, Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters. I can't say the words to descibe this movie. There is maybe one or two semi funny scenes in the whole 90 min of boredom. If you like daydreaming buy this DVD
0, Worst book from Whitman ever: The black and white photo's look like photocopies of photocopies.And to add insult to everyone
1, My nephew loved this!: I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
1, This is a Great Product!: I bought this having read some bad reviews about it but you get what you pay for! But I was actually blown away by it
0, it stings: picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
0, Terrible Nickel Allergy triggered by strap connectors/adjusters: The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin. There should be a warning on the tag but there isn't. If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this. In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic. This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout.
0, Product is cheaply made
0, Genuine Chinese Crap: This radio is insanely over-priced. You can get worse
1, I agree: I agree with the review from August 8
0, LOUSY PHONE: Good Price with a nice package
1," Great CD: This CD contains nearly all of Peter Gabriel's through the album ""So"" in 1986. Go through the track list"
1, Just what I wanted: I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away
0, poor quality: Item is very heavy and does not hold a charge well. illumination begns to dim almost immediately and is never very bright. I would not purchase this item again.
0, Poor light - Looses charge fast: I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well. You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased.
0, Flashlight: Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one.
0, Reed switch doesn't work
0, Not Louie Anderson's finest hour...: I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen. Besides my dad and me
0, Not Recommended: I am very disappointed with this phone. I have to press the talk button several times to get a dial tone
1, Better than expected: I don't really expect a lot from Voyager novels. Fact is
0, Let's replace plot and acting with profuse profanity and see if they can tell the difference...: This movie is just plain bad.Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like it. Having come off watching American Zombie
0, Original thought: This movie had an original idea

1, Changing from a 20th Century status and power driven environment to a 21st continuous learning and collaborative environment: After Image is much more than a marketing and branding education. Grant communicates very powerfully the change in structure and thinking that is necessary for individuals and for us as whole to succeed in the 21st Century. His explaination of moving from a work/status ethic to a continuous learning/collaborative/networking ethic provides a structure for individuals

0, Does not work with XP: After spending several weekends installing & re-installing this product on my XP Pro box
0, How Could You Do This?!?: AAAGGGGHHHHHHH! That's the sound of millions of Anne of Green Gables fans screaming in collective disgust. Not only is this last Anne movie bad. It's HORRIFYINGLY bad! I am a strongly against capital punishment but this movie has given me pause. I can't believe the Canadian government didn't put the movies producer in front of a firing squad for the way he thoroughly trashed the wonderful stories of Anne
0, The worst movie ever: My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it
0, A Stain on Lucy Maude Montgomery: This final installment of an otherwise brilliant trilogy on the Anne of Green Gables story is beyond horrific. It is a stain on the memory of Lucy Maude Montgomery.
0, unimaginably bad: I bought this despite the bad reviews because I thought it was impossible for an Anne movie to be that bad
0, Disappointing: I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies. When I heard they were finally making another movie
0, Disappointing: This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately
0, dissapointed to say the least: I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea movies as a child from start to finish and then immediately rewinding them to start again. This movie is an intirely different story. Not only was it a far cry from the book version
0, Not the same as Anne 1 & 2.: This was a major disappointment. I loved the first and second of the Anne series
0, Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were 
0, Don't do it!!!!: The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful
0," Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!: There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the ""Anne books"" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes"
0," Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control: The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe"
1, great movie great service: my daughter and I love this movie. we have been watching it since she was a child she is now in her 20's and we still watch it together.
0, Darcy: On it's own
0, I am very disappoinsted.: This film lost simple life of characters and sense of humor of basis of Anne's series.
0, Not as Good: I didn't like the Continuing Story as much as Green Gables and Avonlea. I guess Anne and Gilbert was all grown up in the Continuing Story. Didn't really like the war atmosphere
1, still a riot
0, Not what I had expected: This course while extensive in activities
0," DRIVE-IN SECOND FEATURE: ""Are you really going out with him?""""UH-HUH"".""By the way"
1, Very good!!!: Is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc aren't up to those of his other recordings? Play this album back to back with So and you will notice that the sound on So is much crisper and cleaner. Anyway
0, Spend a little more and get a better router: I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!
0, Easy setup
0, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!
0, Repeatedly Hangs: This router has good functionality and ease of use
1, Good Solid Cordless Phone: I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone. I have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer. I am a self-proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands. I think that Panasonic and Sony make the best phone and I think that Panasonic
0, ditto to horrible battery life...: my first panasonic 2563 works great...this 2583 won't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes talk time...and it's only two weeks old!!!!!!!!!!customer service offered to replace it with a refurbished model when all i'm looking for is a new battery...i paid top dollar so that i could trade it in two weeks later for a refurbished unit...........i'm very dissapointed with them...never another panasonic.
0, Lousy support after the sale: We lost the handset. Called Panasonic to get a replacement
0, Disappointed consumer: I had a Uniden phone for over 10 years which I loved. Unfortunately lighting hit and blew out all my phone lines and phones. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right phone and thought I had. I bought this phone about 1 1/2 years ago
0, Panasonic 2563W: Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also
1, Amazing set of cookware!: Its been a very long time since I reviewed anything...but this set deserves my time to review. Though I bought this set elsewhere
1, Yes another live album
1, Is Good: Yet another live Stones album
1, Unbelievable: I'll echo exactly what the previous 2 reviewers wrote
1, Our gritty female ancestors were amazing!: I started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that I couldn't get enough of their stories. Before reading this book
1, Possibly Gabriel's best solo work: I was surprised to see some relatively-negative comments directed towards PG's second solo album. I recently re-visited this album after many years
1, Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
1, What a great 80's movie: I watch this movie over and over. I've watched since I was a little girl and I still love it to this day. It's a very addicting movie.

0, Save your money unless you like pain: All I did was walk down a hallway twice in my house and both little toes feel as if they were cut up by razor blades. They look comfy but the front strap is stiff and just cuts right into your toes. Beware.
0, There is no such thing as out smarting wall street!!: Is there really such a thing as out smarting wall street? They could have easily titled this book how to buy stocks that go up and short stocks that go down. Remember this book is from folks who don't know how to make profit in the business they run? Do you really want to learn how to invest from these people?

0, It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.: I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.

1," Earth Crisis said ""All Out War!"": And here it is haha!As soon as I heard there was a movie about straight-edge kids coming out I freaked. First I thought it was goin to be like a Hollywood straight-edge thing where they'd confuse edge with emo or something and I didn't want to see some edgers whining about girls. But then I heard it was made in the NYHC so I was super excited when I saw it at Tower. The first half was ok it was kind of boring and there were black & white parts that I still don't know why they were black & white"

1, Has lasted years and passed on from older brother to little brother.: This item was bigger than expected which was a very nice surprise. It has lasted for several years used by one boy then passed on to his younger brother when he was interested in looking a bugs. It is easy to store on a shelf and find when suddenly a bug springs up that a boy wants to take a closer look at. the mesh cover is somewhat transparent but the best view is from the clear acrylic door not the side. No bug has ever accidentally escaped yet.
1, Elvira Madigan: This DVD of a 1967 Swedish movie was just as I have remembered it when it was first released. Great photography and great background music. A most enjoyable film that can safely be viewed by all the family.

0, Check out before you buy: The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work

0, I'm sure it's useful if you could read the print!!: This Concordance has the SMALLEST print I've ever seen in ANY book!! Even with my reading glasses I have to squint in order to make out the print. I even tried a magnifying glass but gave up. I don't know who would able to use this book. I wasted my money since I can't even read it!!
0, Not complete does not offer the original word next to the Translation: I am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being. I was expecting a Compact version of my Strong's Concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness. It is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth.For example you will never know from this book that YHWH (Hebrew 3068) is used nearly 7

1, A blend of beauty and magic!: This CD is magical
1, Classic Lauren: Lyrics are very relavent to these days and times that we live in. Music is awesome
1, Lauren you're the best and keep getting better: Lauren I love you and your music I generally don't liste to younger artists because of the violence they promote
0, Simultaneously pretentious and moronic: This is even more brain-dead than the average rap CD. She's certainly pretty enough; why can't she hire someone to write her some decent songs to sing? Or one even.
1, Lauryn Hill is an exceptional music artist.: For anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists
0, A decent album
1, This Lauryn Hill at her best.: This is one of the most sincere

0," What a Shame: There is a lot of background music in this film that never made this collection. Unfortunetly it was also some of the best music from the movie. Why don't they put together ""real"" soundtracks that include all of the artists used? Instead they always give us their own watered-down choices. Bummer."
1, How can something so simple be so complexly beautiful?: When you play this CD

0, Oh Please!: Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I

0, Very disappointing: Being a huge Grisham fan
0, boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
0, WORST BOOK TO ME; OTHERS FIND IT BEST.: This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast
0, If You Want to Read About Small Town Living: At first
0," Grisham's not so stunning ""comeback"": This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years"
0, Fast reading
0, But....!: Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
0, The Man has lost it: I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books
0," What a disappointment!: John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each ""novel"" has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books."
0, The worst Grisham book out there!!!: I have read most
0, fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
1, A Character Study: The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development
1, A fun
0, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer): I read this book a while ago
0, Definitely not his best work: I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting
0, This is the worst book he has ever written: This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about
0, Grisham has lost his touch....: Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques
0, Last Juror: Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry

0, Offbeat Humor: I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie. This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.

0, service engine light: This cap has caused my 'tighten gas cap' light to alert numerous times. I had a hard time making it fit so i'll not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip. If you are buying this product for a 2004 silverado I would consider spending an extra 5 or 10 bucks on a cap that wont give you mentioned problems.
0, I should have believed the other reviewers...: Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it. It is pretty easy to set up
0, Too poppy: David Bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy-coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates MTV and radios all over the US.His new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual David Bowie. Too many generic drum and guitar tracks.Don't bother. If you're interested in buying anything

1, Loved it!: Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted
1, K&N air filter: This product really allows my suzuki gsxr to breathe better - Its a great item and i will be sure to recommend you to other bike riding friends of mine.
1, good breather: its a different shape than the stock filter for my 82' xv750 but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox
1, A great filter that gave me extra power: I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that
1, Good Purchase Experience: The filter was exactly as identifed when ordered. It was shipped promptly and packaged well enough to protect it during shipment.
1, Great price: 2010 Honda Goldwing very good price for a performance filter that can be washed and reused. Plus I believe that K&N filters flow more air.
1, Not great but is okay: All right
0, Didn't fit properly.: I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in
1, K&N's for every ride I own...: I always purchase K&N air filters for every vehicle I own
0, Wouldn't work: The sharpener sat around for a month or so before I used it. When I went to use it
0," not heavy duty!: This sharpener is a joke. I have a small school and need to sharpen 10-20 pencils a day. Bought this ""heavy duty"" model"
0, Don't Buy This!: Expensive as it is
0, mediocre: In my opinion
0, This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS: This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact
0, quiet. then loud.: This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times

0," Drew Barrymore has made her ""opps!"" movie once again: Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie ""Ever After"" which i thought was a OKAY movie"
0, BORING!! But barley okey: This is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time . Even though Drew Barrymore is in it . It still doesn't steal the show . The middle was okey but the rest was just plain Garbage .
0, Home Fired!: It is a very good thing that Drew Barrymore did not choose this film to kick start her career. This film was a bomb from the word go. It was overly campy and completely unbelieveable. While the premise of the story is somewhat interesting
1, Best TV Series EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER: As the cover said
1," Great Art based on Great Art: This production need not be limited to ""ever made for TV."" This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again"
1, it doesn't ever get better than this...: they show this on PBS sometimes so even if you choose not to purchase the best drama ever to grace the 21 inch screen you can still see it. it is so far above anything else to first appear on television you may wonder how it ever was produced! perhaps that is a story in of itself. in any case it is truly one of a kind and to not see it would be like never seeing Dr. Zhivago or Casablanca or any of the other larger than life tragic love stories of this century.
0, Brides head revisited: This product was ompossible to watch the sequence of episodes was all mixed upFor example episode 9 was only able to be played by pressing episode11 and so on.When there were three episodes on a disc the middle episode would not respondAnd could not be played.I was amazed to receive such an inferior product from amazon.

0, Beware of Seller: I ordered this book mid-April for Mother's Day. It did not arrive at the estimated time. I waited another week then contacted the dealer. They said I needed to wait the maximum shipping time before they could resolve the issue. It still did not arrive so I contacted them again and they stated that they would send the book now. I waited again and it still didn't arrive so I sent another email. Amazon has issued a refund because the seller now says that the book is apparently out of stock. I feel they should have said that from the beginning.
1, A good starter book to help focus on WWII books of interest: I really liked this book. I use it to further add books to my Wishlist. Dunnigan's mini-summaries of included books are loaded with details. I have several books by Dunnigan all of which I have enjoyed reading. Some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books. I try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored. Given his background and experiences

0, What a disappointment...: I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well
1, YesYore: Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks

0, I'm unhappy !!!!: I didn't receive this item. I live in Brazil and I asked to a friend of mine
1, Fantastic but: The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative
1," Pure magic: Morgan LLywelyn is one the most gifted writers writing today and ""Lion of Ireland"" is her masterpiece. You feel her passion and the love she has for the Irish in her words and her unique storytelling talent makes this book one of the best books I have ever read."
1, A truly magical book: This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie
0, Trite and predictable: I was excited to read this book based on the reviews
0, A big disappointment: I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages
0, Catastrophic Hissy Fit: How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it
0, POLITICAL ONLY: WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
0, Terrible: I found this book to be simply unreadable. Too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable
0, A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking. I expected a fun romp of cooking mishaps
0, Movie better than the book: I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book
0, Stay as a Blogger: This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is
0, Profanity detracts from material: I can count on one hand the books I have thrown away in my lifetime of 47 years. I treasure books and respect them
0, too much julie not enough julia: The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book
0, Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog: I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar
0, I did not like this book: After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant
0," Don't waste your time or money on this awful book!: Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The ""f"" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans"
0, I tried: I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now
0, Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook
0, disappointing: I love both cooking and reading blogs
0, Just OK: The character was self-absorbed past distraction. In fact
0, Horrible Recipes Made Bearable: As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter
0," Don't waste your money: Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's ""good"" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on"
0, Ick
0, I bought this for a laugh...: This is just hilarious. Mary-Kate and Ashley releasing their Greatest Hits 3 album- what could be funnier?! I don't really know whether to give this one star for musical ability
1, Must Have for Newborns: This was by far our most useful baby gift-- it helped our baby get to sleep and even saved our sanity a few times. Nothing calms a crying newborn better than a good swaddler. At first it's a little tricky to figure out how the velcro fits together
0, Simply put - does not work: I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket. After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one
0, Not for Baby Houdinis!: I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling
0, worse than a straight jacket: My baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled. Definitely the worst baby product I've purchased.
1, helps baby sleep better!: very nice. easy to use. highly recommended. baby always seemed to manage to escape his blankets- this he can not get out of :)
0, Too big: Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs. They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need. The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out. I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it
0, Ok
0, Keep it tight!: Make sure its as tight as possible
1, nice gift: This is a very uplifting mix of Christmas music. If you like Celtic music
1, SMALLER than what it says on the prod description.: The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is 1 inch in diameter NOT 1 1/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.
1, oil rubbed door knobs: perfect size and color to replace the chrome ones when we did the redecorating in our bathroom -- lots of browns
1, look nice: they do look like the could cost you alot more but the quality really shows after time... the finish does remove from the knob over time but for me it wasnt a big deal since it was for a basement... but if you need if for a upscale kitchen i would pass but for a back room or an old drawer its perfect
0, Never arrived: I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
0, Made in China; that says it all!: Dont' bother with these rotors! They warped after barely 300 miles. I was assured by PowerStop that their products were NOT from China
0, N.G. For TIVO: I agree with other users.... If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters
0, i dont know if it works...: worked but a weird deal
0, Doesn't work and very frustrating: It worked at first but the connection kept dropping. Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears. You can't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so can't change any settings. A total waste of time and money - don't bother with it.
0, Doesn't work and merchant won't allow returns: This product is horrible. We own a Belkin and it works
0, Wow! What a piece of junk!: I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably. Never got it working correctly. Netgear won't just let you install the drivers and be done with it. No
0, Don't waste your money!: Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money. It's easy to set up (I'm running Windows 2000) and starts working at first
1, Delicious: Our Shiba Inu
1, We all love this!: This is an excellent treat for my cats
0, No Mre sequals!: This movie did not fill it's axpectations
0, Big Fat Letdown: After the amazing Spider-man
0, I wanted to like it I really did!: I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.
1, Spiderman 2: Grade A+: This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action
1, Great movie!: I thought it was a great movie. Personally i think it's the best out of the three out today.
0, Marketing really does work.: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted
0, smallville anyone?: I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said
1, Spider 2 Strikes Gold!: This movie has an excellent story (better than the first). First rate acting
0, Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is
1, Very awesome<3: its full of action
0, Awful - Nearly Painful: I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff
0, Not that Good: The first Spiderman was way better than this garbage. the acting was horrible and the action scenes... well there were hardly any action scenes. This movie sucked there was way too much talking. Doc Oc was horrible he wasn't even mean. don't waste your money.
1, good
1," Better than the first: Remarkably entertaining movie. I still get chills watching the action sequences on my 27"" Television."
1, Great price!: My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
1, best hdmi player: best picture quality excellent sound and very good aesthetics .price is very low .easy to convert to all region
1, Build Better Than Expected: Great product at great price (69.99 with free delivery). I recently purchased a panasonice upconverting dvd player and although the video
0, Would be great if I could watch it: Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show
1, Wilbur Smith at his best: I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years
1, Excellent reading
0, A trashy
1, Fundamentals of Management: Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page. I feel this is a great book to get started with in management.
1, Well organized and easy to understand: My husband is using this book for his management class
1, So cute monogrammed!: The bedding I picked out did not have a diaper stacker...so this one went perfect. To tie it in with the bedding I got the top monogrammed. It looks so cute! Very pleased with it!
1, Follett's Guide to Usage: As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on
1, If you like the classics
0," No ""Classics""... RIP OFF: I bought this expecting to get the classic xmas movies such as frosty the snowman and rudoff the rednose raindeer. I was VERY disappointed to find out neither were included. It has such movies as Frosty gets Married and Rudoffs 4th of July"
0, get your money back: Big disappointment
1, Christmas Classics: This is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well. I knew what I needed to order (I borrowed the box set but I broke one disc so I had to replace the whole thing). This was the cheapest place I found it. The set arrived very quickly. Thanks!
1, Clasic Christmas Favorites: The grandkids loved this one. Not only did they get the favorites but the set included several the family had not seen!
0, no little drummer boy 2: the trailer on this dvd set has advertisement for little drummer boy 2 but this dvd set does not have it instead you get pinnohios christmas dont know why warner did this but thats what is there
1, ....And I'm Not a Stephen King FAN!!!!: While I don't relish in Horror pictures
1, Should become a comedy classic: This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful
1, Charlie: He had very long nose
0," One good song: I like one song on this cd. ""It's in the Rain"" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them"
0, Predictable an uninspired.: Enya needs a change
0," A long wait for ""Enh!"" (yuk): Now"
1, You lose all cred ripping someone a new 'A' when you can't spell and make grammatical errors: I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'. I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii
1, A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice
1, Amarantine: More of the Good Same.: If you like Enya and you have them all
1, Whyte Weaves Wonders: A friend's Florida condo is as unlikely a setting to begin Whyte's Camulod Chronicles as one can imagine
1, Worth Every Penny!: What can I say
0, This doesnt do rage credit: The Cd is a disgrace
1, Looking Backward: I have a bad habit of diving into major events years after they occurred. I didn't understand Enron worth spit when it happened
0, boring
1, Very Informative and Helpful: For anyone who searches to resolve the mysterious of stuttering
0, Larry Garfield is compared to?: When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street.
1, Great speech by Larry at the end!: Not a bad movie -- not great
1, Love having a female hero: My two and a half year old does not watch much TV but she loves Jane and the Dragon on Saturdays (she also likes Jacob Two Two and we have ordered those books as well). She was very excited when she saw the books as well. In a time when TV execs could not allow Dora to be on top (by giving Diego his own show) it is nice to have a female lead that is strong and brave but also sometimes makes mistakes and learns from them.The stories are interesting enough for older kids too.
1, Saw the TV show? Read the book.: If you have seen the wonderful Jane and the Dragon tv series you will enjoy the book. You hear the basic story in the theme song and wonder how Jane and her dragon met and what made the king let her train to be a knight. This book tells that story! It is an enjoyable story that engages everyone from children to adults. I highly recommend this book.
1, Great transmitter but not universal: I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!
0, cant rate
0, Read carefully before you purchase from Amazon - see below comments: I was upset with this Amazon purchase because when I played the movie (Frankie & Johnny
1, It's good
0, Don't Waste Your Money: I bought this sharpener for my kids to use at home. We tried it a couple of times but it never sharpened a pencil evenly (wood all up one side so you can't write with it)
0, Doesn't work!: This sharpener did not work from the first time I attempted to use it. It only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener. It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak. I’m sending it back.I do NOT recomend this item.
0, Disapointing: I ordered the Boston pencil sharpener and was sent the x-acto sharpener. I do not like it. My round pencils get stuck. The opening is not quite big enough. It is very noisy and it does not sharpen evenly. I sharpened three pencils and will return it. Very disapointing to get a different product than ordered.
1, It works: All I needed was something to sharpen pencils with. We always get those cheap sharpeners that cost 50 cents at walmart.....no good. This is perfect.
1, A reading escape: I want a novel that is well written. A book with story
1, A knockout ride of a thriller.: Jeff Fahey's life goes to hell when he receives an arm transplant after an auto accident. Turns out the arm came from a serial killer! Written and directed by genre favorite Eric Red
1, theres a new sherriff in town!!: thses guys rock
1," Reference Quality Blu-Ray Picture: This picture transfer on Blu-Ray is definitely reference quality and worth bragging about and showing off to your Hi-Def junkie friends.I can't comment on the lossless audio quality since I cannot decode quite yet.This is a ""must have"" for any Blu-Ray collection."
1," A movie that as it all!: Before I first watched ""I"
1, A surprisingly good adaptation: Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story
0, Not Asimov material: Smith has shown once again that he can only play one role - that of a disrespectful punk who grates on everyone's nerves. Asimov is probably rolling around in his grave right now. The special effects were good
0, Oh
1, I
0, Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie: I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load
0, Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!: The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what
0, Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!: Drag
1, Maybe 3 and 1/2 Stars: I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However
1, terrific: The book was great! I have already recommended it to friends of mine. I would definitely read it again and again.
1, A peppy lil guy that gets the job done!: HIGHS: suction
0, For Those Who Like Intellectual Jibberish: If you liked high school poetry class
1, After all it is Poe: Great reading
1, Lullabies to paralyze: Well
0, Flummery: Surely
1, Water Filter: This is exactly what was described and perfect! It fits right under the counter and is so easily installed. We searched forever to find a decent looking spout along with the water filter for under the sink and we finally found Aquasana!
1, Best Steak Seasoning Ever: This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store. I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning. Unfortunately my local grocer stopped carrying it! I am worried I won't be able to find it any longer. It really is the best!!
1, my mistake: I bought this to replace the 'fish' that my dog loved and we lost in the woods. I was excited about the 'turtle'. When it arrived it is tiny! My mistake as it clearly states it is for small dog. My 70# lab does love it still. I wish the 'turtle' came in a size for a large dog. Overall
1, Nice to share: I don't like to journal because of the big
1, Great little journal: Received this as a Christmas gift from a dear friend
1, This is great!: This journal allows you to highlight the good things in your life. It makes you think of the positive rather than the negative. It is a must-have!

1," Funny! Funny! Funny!: Bill & Ted are killed by ""robot us-es"". They were sent from the future to prevent the birth of ""Wyld Stalions"" Bill & Ted must now challenge death & escape the afterlife to set things right. Side splitting fun! Recommended!"
0, That Boy Mike Jones Is A Fake Man: That boy mike jones is about to get what is coming to him. He running around houston claiming he the king of the streets boy please. If anyone want to hear some real underground rap from houston go get that Chamillionaire (The MixTape Messiah) cause that is a true mc that should be out there cus Dike Jones -Who- Dike Jones his album is never coming soon. He has been saying that it is coming soon since 2002 but all he has done is put out two trash cds before he would even put out the cd he been talking about for two years. now he about to put out a cd with Paul Wall Called -The Future- but where in the hell is His Solo album. Oh Yeah it coming soon since 2002. Paul Wall messed when he turned his back on Chamillionaire but That Mixtape Messiah pt.2 expose this fraud ni--as. So go get that Chamillionaire The Mixtape Messiah. SO you can remember what real underground music is. Hiram Clarke Tx.
0," Way Too Small For Anything but the Camera: If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your ""stuff"" - nothing outrageous but things like cords"
0, Did not live up to expectations: Getting the book
0, Long and allegorical: Too long.May sound good if you don't know your Bible or Biblical History.The world won't end on 2011 either.
1, Any Fan will be happy.: I did have some concern from other reviews that mentioned the lackluster sound quality. I am very picky about my sound. But the price made me do it and I am happy I did. This CD had all the songs I needed to fill out my collection. The quality was not an issue at all. This is well worth the money
1, what's up w/ Jarrett: This is a great album of atmospheric
1, Nice supplement to study Meisner work.: Nice explanations as to why you learn the words in the way that you do and all books in this series include notebook client pages for you to take notes or practice the exercises. I liked the fact that he included questions of the class and his answers to those questions.
1, A way to understand the language of film.: As a college film instructor
0, Nope
1, Siempre hay que tener 2 baterías: Les recomiendo que siempre tengan 2 baterías

0, Good movie
0, DEFECTIVE PRODUCT: I ordered and had to return two separate copies of this DVD because of wavy lines in the picture on both copies.
1, Detour: Made by a Poverty Row studio in just six days
1, Great book: Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai. I bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful.
1, Path to integrity: This work is from the memoirs of an enlightened soul . written some 600 years ago
1, Insight into the spiritual ideals of the Samurai: The translation may be a little enigmatic at times
1, Love This Mat: This mat is perfect for me. The 10mm thickness provides the cushion that I need for my ankles
1, Best Value for the $$$: Easy to put together. Came with very good and clearcut instructions.You have to have a good amount of floor space for it to turn though.Other than that it is a super buy!!!
0, One-Sided and incomplete: One can go on forever about who is pro this or pro that
1, I bought it by mistake.: First
0, Not So Great...: I purchased this video in a bookstore on Cape Cod last summer and was disapointed. Though I admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the Cape that I know
1, Touching tale of committment and love.: A young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard-earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive. Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story.
1, On time and new as described: Reasonably priced and shipped on schedule. Valves and membranes were new and in packaging as described. Pricing is very competitive and purchasing was easy.
0, no accolades here: I threw this book in the trash
1," Unique Subject Matter: ""Come to Me"" is a book of short stories. Each one dealing with outrageous"
0, Poor: A very poor book. Don't bother. From the title
0, Neither Savage or Sensuous: I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
0, Greek: This was not a very good movie
1, Great book
1, A Good Resource Book: Grasping God's Word makes an excellent resource book for any personal library. It is written in such a way that readers on several levels of education may find it informative and useful. A strong emphasis on application of Scripture is much appreciated.
0, College book: Thank you for sending the book fast so that I could start reading it for my college class
1, Run a full size smaller - but toasty warm: I have several other pairs of slippers for winter
0, do not order these: I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on
1, Warm but less than perfect: Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried
1, Good Christmas Present: My wife asked for slippers to replace some old
0, Almost a whole size too small: I bought these last year and tried them on - too small
1, Great for the price.: I bought these when they were deal of the day for around $15. Can't complain about a deal like that. In response to the reviewers who said to order a size up I'd say maybe order up a half size if you like your slippers fairly loose. When I first got mine I thought they would be too small but after wearing them a couple of days they stretch out and I think they run pretty tru to size. I wouldn't pay $50 for them but if I see them for deal of the day again I'll be buying them for all my family.
1, Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!): We brought this baby home
1, Widge: I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon
0, Bad product.: This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
0, decent products - awful technical support: I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However
0, Waste of Time.: Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters
1, Great look at the feastival!: I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats
1, Loved This Book!: Really opened my eyes on the myths
1," Box Of Hair: I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks ""Riverside"" & ""Not What You Think (Live)"" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs"
0, Poor performance: This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months
0, Terrible packaging: The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display. It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents. Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging.
0, Stupid Amazon Return Policy: Amazon won't take back the item
0, LWatLA: If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time
0, Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware: This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support

1, How to create comics from the man who changed them.: Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay
1, love this book: I love this book for reference on the job. It has tons of diseases and has a great format. I used the full version in nursing school so I found it easy to navigate when i started to practive. It also comes with a code so you can download the book to your PDA.
1, My Great Aunt Arizona: This is a wonderful book. As an elementary teacher I especially enjoy reading it with my students and own a classroom set. It is a beautiful story of a teacher and contains lovely illustrations. It is a sweet depiction of schools and life long ago.

0, Best Data 56K USB Modem Macintosh: As other reveiwers noted this modem cannot stay connected. You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain. Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights. Also Best Data tech support does not respond. There are bound to be better choices.
0, Not worth the title 'junk': I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box. I could not get my g4 1.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried. The tech support would not respond

1," The day the world came to town: Having recently watched a ""Made for TV"" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander"
1, A different look at 9/11: I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.

0," fair towards midland: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's ""Prose Edda"""
0, This light absolutely sucks: Don't waste time or money on this garbage - you can't mount it
0, Book Critic2: I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.

1, Steve Au: This pacifier was the best part of my son's Halloween costume. We got so many compliments on it. It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they don't want to be in.

1, Love it.: I got this as a used product and got a good deal for it.The movie plays as good as new. I like the whimsicalnature of this movie.
0, unbalanced: This is an unbalanced view of the so-called AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Thabo Mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the AIDS orthodoxy. For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour
1, These are gorgeous!: I would expect to pay 6 times more for these lovely earrings in a boutique shop!I have received compliments on them everytime I've worn them!Beautiful!

0, Poor Graphics
1, Worthy Software Game!: When I looked at this game without opening it
1, ZooTycoon Rocks!!: Zoo Tycoon is the best computer game i've ever had! It keeps me busy for hours and I never get bored. With expansion packs it's even more fun. I would suggest it for anyone who likes animals and is interested in zoos. You also learn about animals and what they like in their exhibits. The graphics are really good and the sounds are cool too. It's a little hard when you start out but it gets easier. It's the best game ever!
1, Works fine at half the price: The picture for this shows a totally black tire
1, No kidding: My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.

1, Dain Curse in full: Love the quality of the movieI have a high def wide screen tvwent to the ROOT MENUthe audio had an echo like the sound in a movie theatreAdjusted the audio from Theatre to Living Room and that corrected the musicBUT I still got the echo on my tv for the talkingI played it on my computer--and worked very wellI will have to deal with my tv later! It readjusted the whole tv system.Ah the good old days before HD and all that jazz!There must be a sound adjustment I haven't adjusted yet.
1, Excellent Resource: I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education. There are ideas for everything from ice-breakers to large group challenges that are very effective for building community and encouraging people to work together toward a common goal while having fun at the same time. While some of the ideas require more complex props
0, AWEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
0, Helpful but full of mistakes: Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
0, Kindle Version Must Be Beta: Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention. There are header lines (title and author)in the middle of the screen

0," There is more ""Bad"" about this DVD than just Religion.: This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs"
0, Disappointed - they tricked me: I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all
1, Truely awsome: Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the 1970's: solo

Still I am surprised at how much better the HTR-5590 sounded my first dolbly digital movie blew my mind don't forget i had a 1500$ 1995 model yamaha witch was very good too 
0, Unimpressed: The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however
1, A breath of fresh air!: This album is by far one of the best underground albums I've ever heard. It is a very unique blend of Russian/gypsy style music and good ole rock'n'roll. The magic created by this Colorado band is a wonderful breath of fresh air in the mostly stagnant popular music scene of the last few years. I challange anyone to listen to this album and NOT be dancing their all over the place!
1, Good product
1, Outstanding noise canceling: I use these both in airline travel and at the gym. The noise canceling feature functions well in airplanes. In the the gym

1," Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting: Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other ""Jesus Chronicles"" by same authors about Matthew"
1, Great: This book is in great shape no missing pages hardly any damage. I am very happy with the service I received
0, Don't expect to pass the exam!!: I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well
0, Really Poor Product
1, The tweezer of tweezers: This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
0, Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer: I do not like the slant Tweezers
1, A good book for those with experiance with x86 assembly: This book does not serve as a tutorial to learn assembly; rather it goes into many uses of assembly
1, Worth it..: Explains how to view education in terms of the whole person. There are also people you can meet who can help you follow this approach. This is the real genius of the author: he not only wrote well but there are people who he has educated in this way and who are available to get to know.

1, Addendum.: Mistaking the trees for the wood
1, Resonant.: This isn't on the level of Kangaroo Jack or Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle
0, horrible: Purchased because it was a good price and was comfortable for baby. Regret completely. The crotch latch is so short and uncomfortable for baby. Worst problem was trying to remove the pad for cleaning. Out of three carseats owned
0, Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start

1, The Death Committiee: A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
0, Not happy with this: The whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot I could see on the bike
0, Poor quality: This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
0, Disappointing video.: I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models
1, Too Complex: I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however
1, parts purchase: Kudos to the guys that helped me purchase this part. I had been through many local parts stores and everyone had me waiting many days or weeks even and alot more pricey. I will definitely go to these guys again and I highly recommend them!
0," Typical 80's T & A: I remember back as a teenager watching ""A Current Affair"" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line"
0, Not happy: I thought it was advanced poses. Instead it was some kind of breathing! It was a waste of my money.
1, Worth Listening To: The early years of Tangerine Dream produced some incredible music. Although Mirage lacks some of the drama of Schulze in the Tangerine Dream days
1, the BEST for many reasons: This performance is one of my favorites in a large collection of dance videos. Not only for the dancers and choreography
1, great package!: This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house

0," Helen Fisher's ""Final Solution"": This book makes it clear that Helen Fisher hates men. If a man wrote a book like this from the male perspective"
0, can you say CREEPY: Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell
0, What's the Point?: First of all
0, In-fur-iating: This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
1, Keeps 4yo son busy: It was easy enough for my son to figure out and keep him occupied during long car rides.
0," Another ""Poor little Women"" novel....: Gina and Lawrence are the main characters of the book. The were best friends in childhood and that friendship continues into adulthood. Both are married to other people and when Gina's marriage ends she ends up in at Lawrences house being comforted in his arms. His wife is somewhat understanding but feels that Gina often outstays her welcome. Gina goes through every ""poor me"" emotion from the divorce and it gets obnoxiously annoying! Will someone please write a book where the betrayed women moves on and becomes strong without having to virtually distroy her teenage childrens' lives too?!!!I won't go into detail of what happens next in case you decide to read this boring novel but let's just say that it's predictable"

1," Unsurpassed ""Milkwood"": Richard Burton"
1, Great little product: I bought this little toy at a local auto mart and it has saved the day. It holds the charge for weeks and has never failed me in jumpstarting a car. I leave it in my wife's car during the winter months in case her battery doesn't start and it works great.Definitely a high recommendation.
0, poor construction for terminals: Seems ok at first
0, Poor product: I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.

0, Buyer Beware!!! Rain haven!: We have had this sandbox for about a year and it is constantly filling with rain water. Flimsy lid does not fit correctly and Little Tikes will do nothing without a dated receipt within 1yr - basically told us too bad. Buy the Step 2!!!
1, Obsessive Genius: It was a wonderful biography of Marie Curie and very interesting but there were times I got lost in all the technology and chemistry of it. I would rate it a 4 1/2 but the stars above wouldn't let me rate it that way. What an amazing woman and what amazing accomplishments and contributions she made especially in that time.
1, AWESOME: Just got this sub to replace my sony 8 inch sub. I plugged this sub in
0, Where are the sources?: This book is fantasy. It uses very few sources to support crucial elements and hypothesis and boils down to a delusional opinion of a Right Wing conspiracy theorist. The author refuses to debate this material because it is far fetched and unrealistic and it should **NOT** be taken seriously. It uses eyewitnesses who were in Nanking as sources when they agree with the author; however then when those sources refute the author's opinion
0, revisionist history at its worst: According to this book there was no Rape of Nanking

1, You have to see this Sherlock Holmes Film ... !!!: This one had escaped me ... you cannot believe the Actor who played Minister of Magic ... Fudge was it ... in the Harry Potter Series ... I never liked him in Harry Potter because he was so fake and luke warm (wishy washy) ... BUT you will loathe him in this film - a nasty evil sort of dude - causing more uneasiness because of the psycholigical nature of his crimes ... you'd have more sympathy for him if he ran around shooting people ... not that that's good either .... he really makes a mean blackmailer. The only movie I've ever liked him in was Sense & Sensibility.
0, Pigs at the Trough: This was a very poorly written book. It was repetitive

0, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories: The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good
0, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Horrible movie. I actually laughed a lot

1, Best crochet book ever!: I taught myself how to crochet and this book answered the questions that I had. All the other books I have never explain certain things (like where to stick your hook in your chain row). It also contains alot of patturns I actually want to use rather than 1 or 2 in other books.
0, Mediocre at best: Happy Hooker is neither a book about a hooker or how to crochet. This is less than mediocre - try Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go).
0, Errors and more errors: I was so excited to get this book. I wanted to make almost everything in this book because it was all so cute. However
0, Please.....: Come on....the number of errors.I made the capelet twice
0, Lives in denial: Having read most books on Krishnamurti
0, Warning will not play: WARNING....be careful of buying this unless you have a HD DVD. Too bad I bought this DVD as none of my players can view it and can not return it.
1, Fantasia Amazia: Fantasia always has a great product and once again they deliver. These pencils are superb and sturdy. Great for the half hazard artist whose product ends up all around them. These pencils crashed to the floor often and were not affected (Note: I do not recommend dropping ANY colored pencil)
0, not what you think: First off this helmet is enormous
0, One Star for Amazon!: All the stars in the heavens for Mozart's Zauberflote
1, Good Clean Show: My daughter requested these for Christmas. She watches them over and over. This is a good clean show for teenagers. Highly recommend.
1," ""Fellini-esque"" Tradtional Brass Band Gets Hip: Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy"
1, Easy reading
1, Carry Me Across The Mountain: Dan Tyminski's CD Carry Me Across The Mountain is cool and on the cover of the CD is Dan Tyminski playing the F - Style Nandolin.
1, I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN!: This book is 500 pages long and I read it in 5 days. Putting the book down was impossible and I took it wherever I went. Even though the book is kind of a copy from LORD OF THE RINGS it still will get you hooked. I recommend this book for ages 11 to adult. Interesting turns are always happening to the characters. If you can live through the semi-boring first 40-50 pages you will love this book.
1, My favorite book!: Don't listen to the people who are giving this 1's and 2's. This is the best book i have ever read! If you like fantasy books you definately have to read this!
1, adam s31: I thought eragon was one of the best books i have ever read the best part had to be the end. I am deffintly reading Eldest and the rest of the series
0," ""I love you"
1, ADVENTURE MAGIC AND ENCHANTMENT!: I loved it!!!!!!! I begged my Mom
0," I think I've read this before.: Wow. I've never seen so much ""borrowing"" done. It's amazing!In my opinion"
0, horrible: One of the worst books I have ever read. Ever! I forced myself to read it only because it was a gift
1, Good read
0, Cute story but its been done: While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him
0, Bland.: The kind of repetetive
0, Rip Off: This book was The Dragonriders
0, If their was a -5 Star... I would choose it..: I definitley give 'Eragon' a -5* star. I would if it were an option.Some well known 'funnies' to eragon1. Aria and Eragon will probably turn out to be brother and sister.2. Eragon is mad at Murtagh for being not 'merciful' enough
1, Five stars doesnt even do it enough justice.: FANTASTIC!! AMAZINGLY THRILLING!! Paolini deserves an A+! very original
1, An Awesome Read!!!: Eragon is an awesome read for people of all ages
0, it's not worth reading: There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally
0, ewww!: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was quite interesting
0, I don't care how young the author was at the time...: It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive
1, Great audio theater!: I had already read the book and the Eldest book before purchasing this set. It is an excellent quality audio book. It amazes me that one man did so many different voices. He is an excellent actor. The dragon's voice sounded funny to me at first
0," ""I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN-BOY TERRORISTS!"": [...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality"
1, Eragon: Have you ever been in a place where Riders and Dragons Rule? The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon
0, Childish and too unoriginal: The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom
0, I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old
1, Some southern girl
1, Almost Amazing: The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.
0, Obviously writen by a 15 year old: This book may have a good plot line
1, Eragon Book Review: This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action
1, I Love this Book!: Wow! This was a great book. I anticipate the rest of the trilogy. I'm a fan of Pern and when Anne McCaffery had rave reviews of Eragon
0, Hmmm: This is alright for a beginner but
1, A knockoff--yeah
0, Cliched
0, Needs works: I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully
0, Not too great: this book is a major acomplishment for a 15-16 year old
1, great book @#$% the bad reviews: the inheritence series is a great series to read. i loved every word in it. Also read the next 3 books
0, A REAL STINKER: Eragon is a total joke. I'm like the only one I know who finished it. Most of my friends tossed theirs. Does any character do anything it makes sense on it? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
0, Borderline Plagiaristic: Eragon is a fluffy version of Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time. It shouldn't have been published.I recommend reading The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman instead of Eragon. It is much deeper and much more original.
0, Had he been much older
0," I Could Write A Better Book: The only thing that grabs any attention to the ""Inheritance"" series is that Paolini is only 17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old"
1, Best fantasy book ever: Despite what other people have said about this book
1, Fun read.: This book was a fun read. There are times that you can tell that the writer was in his mid to late teens when he wrote it
1, Very Entertaining: I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While it is a bit derivative
0, Boring and bad writing: All I can say is that i couldnt get through it. Poorly written and rather boring. I love a good fantasy book and there are many good ones out there that others have listed. Don't bother with this one
0, Save Your $ For Something Worth While: Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book
0, don't leave me hanging: I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic
1, Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land
1, Exquisite and Riveting: When I had first heard of the book
0, boring and
0, Not even close to the hype: Poorly written cross of Pern
1," Eragon: I got an ARC of the upcoming Random House release of Eragon at the BEA in Los Angeles; read the book on the way home. Out of curiosity I got a copy of the self-pubbed book to read and compare. I loved both! I wish the best of success to the young man.The Random House reps are spreading this review of Eragon to the trade: ""Full praise to Eragon and I want more! A winner ... tip of the hat to young master Paolini.""--Anne McCaffrey"
0, Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many
0, Two things: Eragon has two things going for it:1) The cover. Come on
1, A Kid's Review - Awesome Book!: I'm 9 years old and I really don't like to read very much but my mom suggested i should read this book. I started reading it and loved it. Eragon is an awesome book and i think everyone who likes action-packed fantasy books should read it. its about a teenage boy who finds a dragon egg and raises it to be a powerful beast. Together they go on a journey to fight the evil king Galbatorixs.This book is 497 pages of fun. I can't wait to read the next one!
0, Yuck!: Shallow characters
0, You Can Run But You Can't Hide: This book is a rip off the famous Star Wars Saga. I cant stand it. It also borrows a few ideas from the Dragon Riders of Pern and Lord of the Rings. It may have been an enjoyable read but still pathetic.
1, excellent effort: Having written fiction since I was 7 (that's 80 years ago)
0, not great
1, An entertaining read: Is it the same world that others made up? Yes
1, Eragon is amazing: Eragon was looking for a deer to eat for his family. He tried to get the deer but he found an egg instead. He did not know what was inside of it. One day the egg hatched and a baby dragon came out. Then the dragon flew in the sky and turned into a big dragon. But then Eragon had to fight the darkness and kill the person who makes fire. Read this book to find out if the firemaster dies. This book is for eight-year-olds and up.
0, Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived
0, verbose!: This book is full of adverbs and adjectives and extremely verbose. Sounds amateurish. Lost my interest. Stick to established fantasy writers to get your money's worth from your reading.
1, WOW!: A wonderful book full of fantasy and wonder. When you think you have the plot figured out it changes and changes again. Better than Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in my opinion!
0, Geez.............: As other reviewers have alredy stated
0, I really wanted to like this book: Really
1, Good
0, Even for a seventeen-year-old....: This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read
0, wow...what a disgrace: oh my god. this novel makes me want to eat six lemons and call my mom to tell her i hate cats. this is not in any ways original. what is happening to childrens fiction these days.
0, Meh ...: This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds
0, Not impressed: The author makes many radical and unrealistic assumptions based on the Bible with not one reference or footnote
1, Learn the lessons in the Bible: To be able to go through the entire Bible
0, The book was great
1, Light
1, Positively hilarious: This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative
1, Creature Comforts Christmas: I really love this short movie
1, interesting: I found the book interesting enough to stay reading it. I was never bored with it. I am always looking for a good western!
1, ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION !!!!!!: Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
1, Harry Potter Movies are Outstanding!: The Harry Potter movies are great! My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. It has a lot of action in it other than the to be expected. It was closer to the book than I expected.
1, great prices: I was very happy with this item! it was shipped quickly and it was still in the factory packaging just as promised. and the price was perfect! i watched it the day i got it.
1, Harry Potter Rides Again: Another fine adaptation (though you get the sense that they could have added in more). The students are growing up
0, Guilty: Drek in the First Degree: All of the Harry Potter movies (as well as the books) are artless adolescent
0, Is this a bootleg copy?: I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites
0," Bait and Switch: Warner Bros. has shown us the dark side of the entertainment business by releasing this ""Ultimate Edition"" without the extended version. It's unfortunate they will still make money on these flawed editions from people who were pleased with the year one and year two sets(as was I)"
1, Very Entertaining: I'm not certain that this edition is better than the dar kand disturbing Prisoner Of Azkaban
0, Italian language available ?: Someone could tell about italian language on ultimate edition ?Thanks for helpHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
0, Not extended!: There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.
0, What a dirty trick: Ran into Bestbuy today grabbed the first DVD of Potter I saw. Got home
0, Betrayed: If you are a fan of the book do not watch this movie. They have turned what may be the best book of the series into an amusement park ride - all flash and no substance. As the books evolve J K Rowling has targeted an older and more mature audience. This movie targets the mindless.
0, why a director is able to ruin an adventure of a lifetime: harry potter movies 1 and 2 and 3 are excelent.they cut
0, Good job
0, Enough Chumps Will Buy It Anyway: Goblet of Fire
1, Very cool book!: Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great
1, Greatest author: This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade
0, cheesy/boring: sometimes when i was reading this i just feel like why am i reding this?? people told me that its a goodbut technically it makes no sense at all. its not tht great honestly.
1, There and back again
1, nicely done: this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well
0, What a HORRIBLE book.: I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on
0, Well this book wins the award for the most boring
1, Deluxe Pocket Edition: I own many copies of the Hobbit to include the audio and ebook. This is a perfect travel version and read it often. Font size is perfect for me and the maps in the cover are great for quick reference. I have noticed a large number of one star reviews for this product that have nothing to do with it with most being either the Kindle version or the audiobook. Take heed when you look at the reviews.
1, All time favorite: This is a classic that can be read over and over. Good for reading aloud to the kids on trips too.
1, I loved it again!: I have several ragged copies of this here and there in and out of boxes. I don't have to hunt any more. It'll always be on my Kindle.
0, The hobit: The book is about a young hobit that goes on an adventurer to get rid of a ring that if you w where it you turn e ebook
0, How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?: If you have some extra time on your and feel like pissing it away
0, the stupidest book i have ever read!: i thought this book was the dumbest book i have read in a long time. i hated it. i found it very hard to get into with all the characters listed in it. i would give it 0 stars if i could.
1, Amazing:): I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings
1, AMAZING: This is the best book ever
1, Classic: There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great
0," Don't buy the audiobook: Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore ""The Hobbit."" My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child"
1, Hobbit: I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow
1, I read it again after 30 years - still good read: Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy
0, good only for insomnia: Actually
0, The hobbit: Disappointed didnt receive the item at all and the transaction said it was successful even got an email confirmation saying my order was successful
0, LOTR is better: i didn't like this book very much. it seemed more like a children's book compared to lotr. Just an opinion
1, Good: Quick and e as y read. Pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them. Good digital copy.
1, Slow but good story: This book takes a while to get into but I guess that is to be expected with an older novel and with Tolkien's writing style. However a good story overall and worth reading.
1, The hobbit: I am not much of a reader but I must say I really liked it had little dragged out spots very adventures
0," Am I missing something?: I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them"
0, Little people versus a huge dragon: The little people win
1, Great book to a Great Series...: First off I gave this book a four because
1," Some people...: Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that ""make"" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like ""The Scarlet Letter"". I am jealous of you people who were ""forced"" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read ""The Hobbit"" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?"
1, Good Book but no music on Kindle Touch: The book is fantantic
0, Poor edition for Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD: I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition. But you cannot so let it be known this is about the edition. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to provide this book in its' most complete form only on the iphone/ipad. The book on the iOS platform has the audio available within it. However
1, awesome little book: This is the second time I've read the Hobbit but the first time I have owned it. It is an absolutely beautiful copy....gilded pages
1, This book is absolutely the best!: I read this book 10 years ago
1, Gorgeous Book: I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me. Its an easy read and the bigger spaced out font just makes it more enjoyable to read for an extended amount of time. Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished.
1, Wonderful!!!: I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit
1, A Fine Beginning: While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings
1, Awesome!!!: This is a great tale I loved every second of it! It is by far one of the best stories I have had the pleasure of reading!
1, lived up to the expectations: was a great book. Unlike LOTR which i tried to read once
1, great but not outstanding: I enjoyed Anderson's book
1, Always enjoyable.: Like visiting with old friends and enjoying a lovely chat. I've read this multiple times and always find the adventure great.
1, The Hobbit is exceptional: The story is adventure and adventure. Exciting and thrilling
0, Somewhat Overrated: The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created
1, Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkien: My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit
1, Amazing book!!! <3: Best book I've ever read!! Love it. Recommend lord of the rings as well. J. R. R. Tolkien really is an amazing author!
1," ""The Lord of the Rings"" Light: This is LOTR light; Well written"
1, hobbit: When I read the hobbit 
1, Adventure
1, Classic: I fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child. Now
1, Pretty Good Book: The Hobbit was grappling! It made me feel like I was the main charecter. The book is about Bilbo Baggins
1, An amazing novel: I am sure there are many reviews for this book already
0," The epitemy of Fantasy: This ""book"" is a travesty to everything ever written. Swoar"
1, Best book ever!: Why 5 stars? Because it's the best freaking book EVER!The Hobbit has
1, The Hobbit: I had never read this book
1, Trail Blazer: Arrived on time in New
1, Great listening: We bought this at our daughter's request. When we saw that it would take 11 hours to hear the whole book
1, Classic: We bought this book to read together with our son. It was a great experience. We also got a few Lego sets to bring the book to life.
1, Fantasy Master: One of the best fantasy novels ever. Many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story
1," The Hobbit: Although The Hobbit tends to be a childs book it is a must read before the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.It is also about to hit the big screen."
1, A Magical Tale: I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun
1, Enjoyed reading again after so many years!: I read the book many years ago in high school and wanted to read it again before I saw the movie. It is a classic and I loved being introduced to all the characters once again.
0," Hobbits are just another type of Elf: I would strongly recommend this book to those who play ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book"
1, supurbe: Cain CoxELA 8The Hobbit/JRR TolkienBook review10/1/03The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo. In the book the hobbit gets taken on the adventure of his life.In one of his adventures he meets some trolls that have a cave behind them and he is sent to look in the cave to look. But before he can get into the cave he gets caught by the trolls. The only reason that he was alive was that a wizard saves him.I thought that this was an exciting and adventurers book. It had a great plot and a great story about wizards
1, Perfect compatibility: Checked with Sears and they could no longer help. I had one remote that I had to hold just right to get it to work.I ordered two of these remotes. The compatibility match is perfect. These are exactly as described. It took me longer to get the ladder out
0, Didn't work: This product tho it seemed to match our current one
0, The Bad Outweighs the Good: This could have been such a wonderful book. The prose was elegant
1, Book was good: The book arrived in excellent condition. It was a fast enjoyable read. Although
0, I don't like it: As a man
0, This is the problem with American Women: If you think this is how a woman should act in a relationship
1," Beth: This book is fabulous. I am a 25 year old female who has always been ""the nice girl."" It's not as if I haven't had relationships. Yet"
1," Why Men Love Bitches - THE BEST there is!: Sherry is an EXCELLENT and THE GREATEST writer there is!!! A MUST read for all women out there!!! This book is the absolute BEST! ""T-H-E B-E-S-T!!!"" The contents in the book are amazingly true and ""real""!!! No other relationship books can be compared to this! You just HAVE to read it and you will see why Sherry is so AWESOME!!! Be your own judge! I love it!!!Sherry teaches you all the PRINCIPLES that EVERY WOMAN should know.... to believe in yourself... and put yourself first.... start counting yourself as Number 1 instead of Number 2!!!Sherry"
1," One awesome book for any woman.: I was the ""nice girl"" before reading this book. This book has helped me so much when it comes to dating. I find myself being happier in relationship than ever before. If you give to much to any man in your life I STRONGLY suggest that you buy this book you won't regret it. I'm even going to buy this book for my closest girlfriends. Before dating another guy read this book he will help you out tremendously."
0, Not completely accurate: This book is directed towards a certain type of women
1, I can't believe how amazing this book is.: I am/was your classic doormat kind of girl and I realized that I just might be doing something wrong. One day I was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book. In the first 10 pages I learned what exactly I was doing wrong. I recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat.
1, great book on dating!: This book is hilarious! But it is also very helpful. I learned a lot of new tatics and approach. Women have a lot of power and when used properly we can get what we want from a man.
1, Wonderful!!: I have told all of my girlfriends single and married about this book. It is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them. We as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works. I have always held my own in a relationship for the most part
0, I don't know if this really gets to the point: I am a fast reader by nature
0, WOW!: This book was manipulation and games to the max. I understand why guys think girls are so crazy sometimes
0," The title should be ""FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF DATING MEN"": If you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue"
1, Girls! It's so true!: I personally loved this book! It gave me a completly different outlook on relatonships and how to hold my own in one. I used to be auch a doormat! Seriously
1, good video for beginners: This video is a mix of streching and extrememly light toning
0, A hodge-podge of personal trivia: I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school
1, Crichton at his best.: The book arrived ahead of the promised date
1, Not typical Crichton fiction: Travels is a fascinating
1," AKA Bentley Little: Horror writer Bentley Little moonlights in the suspense genre under the pseudonym ""Phillip Emmons."" Gruesomely original with the most politically incorrect serial killer ever committed to paper. The final setpiece in a Phoenix hospital"
1, FYI: Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz
0," A Disappointment: I'm going to make this short and sweet. What a disappointment. I also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset I almost but a match to it. The ending left me wanting to throw it out the window. I loved all the previous books but like other reviewers I found myself skipping page after page searching for some ""action"". I'm hoping the next one will be better. Usually I buy the hard copy. I may wait and get it from the library."
0," Very disappointing: If ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" was as mediocre as this book"
0, a long wait for disappointment: after re reading how fire is made 
0, Dissapointment: AFter waiting so long I felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence. Ayla reaches final destination
0, Repetition
1," A ""must read"" book: This book goes with the others books in this series and is a great read. Well worth the money and very gripping."
0, snore.........: I painfully read the entire book just to see if something exciting would happen up to the very end of the book. It didn't.
0, Fans only: What is this series? I guess it is romance
0, Boooring!!!: Ugh...how much can one read about the landscape...the rocks...the rivers??? and Ayla & Jondalar having sex?? I skipped through most of the book and was still bored. What a disappointment
0, A 12 Year wait and this is the best she could do?: Repetitive
1, Worth the wait: I thought the book was very good. It does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything. The book is around 750 pages but well worth the read. Can't wait for the final book.
0, Tedious: Boring and tedious! Repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story -- how many times do you have to tell Ms Auel
0, Same old
0, I waited HOW LONG for THIS?: After waiting with great anticipation for 12 looonnggg years
0, Worst Book I have Ever Read!: Jean Auel should return any and all monies she received from the sale of this book to all the tortured readers who had to endure it!
0, Slooooooow: I was a big fan of Auel
0, Bad graphic design.: The first four books
0, Tedious: Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation.
0, The Shelters of Stone: My teenage daughter and I both enjoyed reading this series. This book in particular was full of interesting insight as to how people may have lived and communicated pre-ice age. Very well written and enjoyable to read. Caution -- not for younger readers due to sexual content.
0, No stars
0, Kindle edition rife with typos: I was excited to have the Earth's Children series available for my Kindle
0, Extremely boring and repetitious: I used to be a huge fan of Ayla to the point that I even read the first three books more than once. The fourth book however didn't attract me as much until I had read 200 pages. I find Auel's latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book. The rest of the reviewers explain perfectly how this book has nothing offer so I won't repeat their comments.I wouldn't recommend this book to any friend.
0, The Shelters of Stone: Remembering way back when this series started with The Clan of the Cave Bear
0, Brainless dribble!: Perhaps I was expecting too much
0, A cure for insomnia: This book is a real snooze. I plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next 12 years - just in case I have trouble dozing off. I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and really enjoyed the next 3 books
0," Agree with ""Just A Reader"": The author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story; in fact"
0, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK: Like everyone else
0," *sigh* I guess it couldn't last forever: No one is a bigger fan of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" than I am - I've read it cover-to-cover at least 10 times since 1996. And the same goes for the others in the series (especially ""The Mammoth Hunters"") which were all really great. I will not be rereading ""Shelters"
0, What happened?: I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time. There were so many chances for drama that were missed
0, Like a Seinfeld Episode....: ...this is a book about nothing. Ms. Auel really phoned this one in
0, Enough already?: Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously
1, I wish it was longer.: I just finished it and I've got a great big smile on my face. It starts out slow but by the end you want more. Thats half the fun imagining what will be next. If your the earthy type this series is a must read. My all time favorite set of books. Get the series and set off on the adventure of a lifetime. If the next one is truely the last please please make it twice as long.
0, WOULD THE REAL JEAN AUEL STAND UP: Would the real Jean Auel stand up. This book
0, Ayla is like a prehistoric McGyver: This book is tiresome!!! Took real effort to read it all the way to the end. I was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore. By the end of the first hundred pages I felt like Ayla was a prehistoric McGyver. Good grief
1, Ties up loose ends: I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures
1, classic: read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover
1, love it: I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great. Lousia May Alcott made 4 girls
1, Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Jr. Library Ed.: I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story
0, Little Women: I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to.
1, Wonderful book
1, This was a really good book 
1, Greaaaaaat Book!You will never want to put it down!!: Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy
0, It's Only the First Half of the Book: I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver. To my shock
1, Good Book: This book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times Happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my Kindle It is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use This book was one of my first and I am really enjoying the story of The March Family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series
1, A story about four girls who change their whole lives.: A brilliant book of true lives. Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end.
1," Little Women: ""Little Women"" is a classical novel of four sisters"
0, boring boring boring!: zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z z z z z z z z zz
0, A Great Book: This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library
1, Compact & Durable: I received my first of these flashlights as a gift. After it was stolen out of my truck
1, good overview: This book gives to a foreign lawyer who represents customers of securities dealers a good overview of the american securities dealers law and the procedures his clients have to go through.
1, Enjoyable Family Movie: I had never read or even heard of the book so I was able to approach this movie with no bias at all. I found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable. The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character
0, A bad film adaptation of a great book: It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this. This film was not at all faithful to the book. The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg. In the movie
1, Very good but doesn't follow book: We loved the movie very much...my 9 and 5 year old girls loved it
0, Awful Book Cover and Content...: When you first see this book you figure
1, A century in the life of The Hog: Clearly a grand advertisement & a fine way to take a peek at the transformation of The Hog. Along the way you'll catch glimpses of both ten decades of advertising & dressage styles.If you're expecting to see the development of the mystique we've come to associate with The Hog
1, A classic in pristine condition.: The problem with old (esp. foreign) film is that it can be hard to find good editions. Classics like this
1, much cheaper at target: I haven't even taken this out of the box yet but I got it at target for $50! This item is definitely overpriced.
1, Ax Genrich - 'Highdelberg - Super Session' (Germanofon): At (one time)
1, Great Play: I strongly recommend this play. It's a powerful piece and especially great for women to use as cuttings for auditions.
0, Louder than a Diesel engin: The pump sounded like a good deal--SOUNDED is the word that needs to be taken into account here. I bought the pump for a reef aquarium. Before I installed the pump all I could here was the trickle of water from the other pumps. Turned this one on
1, In Times of Trial: Cheryl Brodersen is a gifted teacher. She's candid
0, Agree with other reviews
0, read VICSARJOO's review - more entertaining than the film: I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting... let's be honest
1, Excellent: Finally such an amazing movie appears on DVD! It is no wonder Ingrid Bergman won the Academy Award for this film. She is spectacular as an abused wife
1, Absolutely mesmerizing: I bought this movie based on a recommendation made to me years ago that I had completely forgotten. What a waste of time. I haven't seen a movie this engrossing in many
1, Interesting: This is a very interesting movie
0, iNCREDIBLY STUPID FILM: This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it. The characters were cardboard and I can't believe Ingrid Bergman starred in this junk.The main character totally lost it
1, I have to say this!!!: There are already over twenty reviews of this movie at this site
0," You Know What They Say About Sequels: I loved ""The List of 7"""
0, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT: I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development. Characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste. I still believe Frost has the potential for great exciting fiction
0, SAVE YOUR MONEY this isnt a repair manual: I own dozens of Haynes and Chilton manuals and they actually show you how to service something. This book goes over NOTHING. It gives very basic info that doesn't help you at all. I was working on a 10yr old Duetz and it had a few pages on 70's models but no spec sheet or repair info on anything. I ended up having to pay someone to service it because I couldn't track down specs and apparently neither could the author of this book. WASTE OF MONEY
1, The Best Clarke You'll Probably Never Read: This book is out of print and pretty hard to find
1," A beautiful song: I got ""I hope You Dance"" for my eight year old who is a dancer.She looks so sweet dancing to it.It is a beautiful song.I also got ""A Song For My Son"" for my mother groom dance with my son at his wedding in June. I love this song too.Thanks to some great writers and singers both my children have a special song from me."
0, Disappointed: I bought this album just for the 'I Hope You Dance' song that I liked so much on the radio. I was very disappointed to find the song had been 'redone' with somebody called the Sons Of The Desert
1, It is a necessity for anyone over 50!: This is a workbook-for both those comtemplating death or planning for it as an eventuality. It is also an instructional book on various methods of dealing with property so that one's wishes are fulfilled after death. Even young adults should have this to help parents or friends deal with loved ones with fatal or potential fatal diseases.
0, Me quede aterrada con ese final: Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros
0, no es tan buena: Esta novela es entretenida
0, defect merchandise: i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on 08-15-02 at compusa/madisonWi. I found that it didn't beam and took it back for an exchange model
0, be careful: be very careful. I have a sony clie and it broke 2 months after i got it. is started getting white spots under the screen
1, Great Magazine: We love this magazine. My husband and I are planning a move to Maine and this magazine is a fun read for us.
1, Excellent Book! Great Examples!: This book covers almost every aspect of Exchange that you will need to pass. It also has study questions that are almost identical to the ones that you will encounter on the test. The CBT that comes with the book is useless though.
1, Good book with detail information: This study guide not only lets me pass the exchange 5.5 exam
1, HANGMAN'S DIARY WITH A VIGOROUS STYLE: Franz Schmidt's diary is written in a pity
0, Great Features
0, Not a best buy: Yepp 700H is nice looking but apparently only works with iTunes 1.1 or 1.2 on the Mac platform. iTunes is on 3.0 with 2.0.4 being the last working version that ships with Apple products. It is useless to say Mac compatible.On a PC
0," bad: nanci needs to get back to her roots. I would just like to hear some new work from the ""old"" nanci. This cd is terrible"
1, Nanci Griffith album: I thoroughly enjoy this album. It has been a while since I purchased a CD of Nanci. I was not disappointed. The selections were excellent.
1, Fresh - clean
1, No one did it better: In my opinion
1, A Very True Side of Human Nature: Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States
1, Enjoyed it more now than in high school: Get characters. All kinds of emotional confrontations. Some things would be politically incorrect now. Loved it. Nice break from some of the thrown together single topic stories I've read recently.
1," In repsonse to ""A reader from St. Louis"
0, didn't live up to my expectations: I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested
1, A Deeper Pip: Worth re-reading as an adult. This was mandatory reading in middle school. Nobody of that age could get the full story with all its nuances at that age. It's like reading a new book. What a wordsmith Charles Dickens was.
1, You can never go wrong with Dickens: How nice to reread an old classic as an adult
0, BO-RING!: This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton
0, Long-Winded
1, Ever the best of friends!
1, Classical Literature: Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup
1, Great Book!: I had to read this for my AP English class. At first
1, The book was kind of confusing
0, Overrated
1, Long
1, still a classic: Don't waste the classics on kids. I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school
1, Beyond my Expectations: I know for sure now why Charles Dickens is such a famous author for works other than A Christmas Carol. The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing
0, Profoundly worthless.: Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel. This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay
1, Finally
0, Other reviewers must work for the author: The book doesn't show a user how to use the lang. in a real world environment. The examples in the book are to simple for the user to understand how to transfer the in to something a user can use.
1, Sorprendente y entretenido: Me recordó aquellos libros de la Generación Kronen: un libro muy pop donde ha calado el lenguaje cinematográfico para presentar la trama. Personajes bien definidos. Un libro entre Yorkshire y la nostalgia del Levante español. Sorprendente y entretenido.
0, hi: i ordered this movie off of amazon 2 months ago because my uncle in lebanon wanted it so i ordered it a month and a half in advance and i still have not gotten it this is horrible.
1, Eliminates rusty bolt freeze up: I started using this on the recommendation of a sports car mechanic (lug nuts). I then started using it on anything that was going to be exposed the the weather. Now things like spark plugs
1, Great shorts: Very comfortable and durable shorts. I bought several pair of these shorts and wear them constantly. I recommend them highly.
0, You can find better: There are better shorts out there - these felt rough
1, This one is the perfect afternoon read!: The Story Princess by Rebecca Winters~ Harlequin Romance #3090 ~ November 1990What a charming love story! I was enchanted from the very first pages when we are introduced to Peter and Michael Wolfe
1, No Problems: The material was as described and was delivered on schedule. The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube. Otherwise it would be five stars.
1, Different: Being a person who enjoys the sound of trance but not necessarily a fan of it
1, This is quite oddly
1, Profound: I bought this CD blindly - just because I needed something to listen to
0, DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!: 've Been looking for this movie for a long time and I really was happy for have gotten it
1, A classic: This is one of my favorite movies and I was so happy to find it on here for sale. It not only has the dvd but also special features! The movie quality is great for the date of production. Would definitely recommend this movie!
1, Truly a classic!: This movie came out when I was 9 and it's been a fixture it my movie collection ever since. There are so many memorable moments
1, ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES: This is one of the best movies ever. The cast stands out in this movie about a women's baseball leaue during WW2. Tom Hanks usually gets top billing in this movie
1, A Must-Read for any Ladakh Traveler: Ladakh is an unbelievable spot
0, I'd like to thank the Academy...: This album features a large English chorus singing traditional Christmas songs. Songs are sung not just in English
0, Plastic Taste: We tried everything to get rid of the plastic taste. We ran through plain water
0, The Keurig Special Edition model is NOT recommended!: The Special Edition model is NOT recommended!I recently purchased the Special Edition model as a replacement to my single serve Tassimo. I changed because my favorite Starbucks single serve coffee changed from the Tassimo to the Keurig. Well
0, great product
0, PERFECT FOR THE RECKLESS CONSUMER: We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE
0, Floating pieces of black plastic: After having the Keurig for one year the plastic lip inside where the coffee pod sits completely broke in several different pieces and landed in my coffee cup. Three friends of mine had the same thing happen after having the Keurig for a short time. It seems the heat from the Keurig eventually weakens this piece and makes it brittle enough to break apart.
0, Shrunken version of original is WAY TOO SMALL!: The original
1, Illustrated Children's Bible: This is a great illustrated children's Bible. My only complaint is that the font is extremely tiny.
0, Shocking Small Unreadable Text - Waste of Money: WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!I had no idea that this book was a pocket edition that is UNREADABLE. I wish I had read through all the reviews before I purchased this item. The book is tiny and the font size is ridiculous.I would return it but would cost me more to return than to just throw it in the bin.Really disappointed with this seller not informing buyers more clearly. Obviously a lot of people have the same opinion as me and would like AMAZON TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT if they can so others aren't ripped off!!!!I have used the larger book for quite a while and it is an excellent book that you can actually read unlike this one.
0, Way too small!: With the price
0, Disappointing: Although the text is wonderful
0, Very Small Print for the young eyes: If you are thinking of purchasing this bible
0, fonts are too small for children to read: My children love the content but I can't let them read the book for too long.Double the size of the font and print it in a larger format would be better.
0, Children's Illustrated Bible: I bought this book for my 8 yearold grandson and did not even give it to him. The book appears to be miniaturized. The print is so tiny that many people would not be able to read it without magnifying glasses! It is not appropriate for children given this tiny print. The pictures are well done and it would have been a perfect gift if the print were not so small.
1, Her best record to date: Davis really shines here. Her first two records were commendable in their artistic integrity
0, 'Natural Foods? Just another mainstream American Cookbook.: With the words 'natural foods' heading the title
1, Tiffany Ortiz's Review: This was a refreshing book. I thought it was written with great insight. The ending was a change from the typical happy ending. The characters seemed real not fictional. I liked that your evil character Virgil had more than one personality trait. Thank-you for having a conference call on a Saturday morning; that was really gracious of you to do that. Thank-you for writing this wonderful book. I can't wait to read any other books you write!
1, A Look into a complicated man: This book brings you into a thinking mode while entertaining you.A capable man who can make practical reality based decisions whodeclines to take control or make things happen in his personal life. A man who reacts rather than acts
1, Waiting for the World to End Review: Waiting for the World to End to me was a very interesting novel. I thought that the book was a lot different from other books I have read in the past. The ending was not what I had expected but it was unique. Waiting for the World to End related to real life situations and controversial issues. The book showed that not everyone is perfect and everyone does make bad decisions in their lives. The book gave me faith and let me know that when life is bad to just hang in there.
0, Review: I had neutral feelings torwards this book. I didn't hate it
0, IMAGINATION: WHEN I READ A BOOK I DO NOT CHOOSE TO KEEP TRYING TO USE MY IMAGINATION I PREFER THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AND I DID NOT FEEL MUCH FOR THIS BOOK
0, Waiting for This Book to End: The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and
1, Works OK: I personally like this
1, Very satisfied.: Dvd movie was as promised. Very satisfied. Thank you. Saw this movie ages ago when it came out. Still very good.
1, An excellent tale of the military
0, A dissppointment: Our neighbor across the street has a little girl with downs syndrome and my daugther who is 4 has started to notice that she is different from her. I wanted to get her a book that showed someone with downs syndrome doing real things so that I could use it as an example. Unfortuntately the pictures are so far away that you don't really get to see Russ. It would have been better if there were some closer photographs.
1, Easy and useful!: I have these in the corner of my daughters nursery with various little things on them (vase of flowers
0, Problem With These Discs: Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player
1, A diverse
1, Great CD: This CD exceeded my high expectations. Highlights for me are the title track
1, Very Good
1, some tropicalia in your pants.....: i must say that if you don't hear the very intense influence of the most brilliant 60's tropicalia band Os Mutantes here
0, The Gangster Chronicles: I remember the original NBC tv series
1, This book may can be life changing: I first was given this book to read over thirty years ago as a very young Christian. I could hardly put it down. I was so struck by the very personal relationship David Wilkerson had with God and how God led and guided him so intimatley. It caused me to seek God's direciton in my own persoanl life and I can honestly say
0, ?????: I thought this was going to be a live performance from KENNY G.instead this was just a recording with a fire place burning not what i was expecting.
0, Major loose end: Two days after I finished this I thought -- hey
0, What an incredible letdown!!!: At first I was unable to put this book down. The intriguing beginning piqued my interest
1, Captivating who-dunnit; keeps you guessing again and again.: Captivating throughout. Though in the end
1, A Must for Art Quilters: An absolutely inspirational book for the art quilter who prefers the art quilt to be based on historical blocks. A refreshing approach using patterns that are accurate and directions that are concise.
0, NOT A USB HEADSET: I typed in USB headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest I purchased it. When it finally arrived I found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description. The sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible.
0," I didn't know I owned this: I love the ""jingle"" in this movie (x more days till Halloween"
1, This movie rocks!: Forget about the other Halloween movies...this is by far the creepiest halloween movie I have seen. The scenes are dark and atmospheric...the moody synthesized soundtrack is truly the best I have ever heard (even by today's standards). Yes
1, Classic Horror!!: First off....I am the biggest fan of Halloween of all time
0, Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is discraseful! It is is tasteless
0, Dont Let the Good Reviews Fool You!!!: This Is By Far the worst Horror Movie ive ever watched.I really cant say anyting else about it.It could have been good
0, Worst movie ever: This is the most horrible excuse for a movie that I have ever witnessed
1, Cool: H3 is a very different kind of sequel. No Michael Myers. This one has witch craft and all that sci-fi stuff. Above average.
1," Loaded with special features: A pretty underrated movie that would have much more acclaim if not for the ""Halloween III"" banner above the title. This disc is great for collectors as the special features are top shelf. Two audio commentaries and a half hour retrospective documentary. A solid transfer and good sound. Recommended for those who watch the extras."
0, What?? Are you people crazy!????: first of all it has nothing to do with the famous Michael Myers searching for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) series
0, possibly worst movie ever: This film is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Oh
0, Time to make corrections: Ok
0, Wow. But wow
0," Wasted ""Witch"": Stupid piece of trash that is the black sheep of the ""Halloween"" franchise"
0, Worst Horror Movie I have Ever seen: where is Michael? Shame On Moustapah Akkad for Naming This Movie Halloween. If You want To See a good movie see halloween 1
1, Hasn't anyone got it yet!?!: I liked this movie
1, OUTSTANDING HORROR MOVIE- AN ORIGINAL: This has got to be one of the greatest and underrated horrormovies I have ever seen. They don't make movies like this anymore and they are hard to find. This movie has all the esseintial key components for a great horror movie--1. Mood.2. Plot.3. Atmosphere.This movie is only for the true horror fan and this movie is well acted to a T' by Tom Atkins. GREAT MOVIE FROM THE 80s.
0, bad: i thought this would be ok but i mean not a good title people say bad title but some said it was ok but not only is it bad but bad acting bad special efects and kids were pupkins on there head stupid stupid stupid and the death scenes kids shake there heads and die and a guy trieng to take over the world bad plot
0, The award of worst movie of the century goes to...: This movie was okay. I have it 1 star because it lacked in suspense and acting. I am sure people would have liked it better if it never had anything to do with Halloween and it was an independent movie! But no
0," Halloween III - Don't Waste Your Time: I am a fan of the ""Haloween"" series of films but have never seen part III (due to eveyone I know saying its terrible). After all these years I wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film. Please note going into this film I knew Michael Myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that. Well - This film is terrible by any standard. I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow"
0," What witch?: Why did they call it ""Season of the Witch?"" There's suppose to be a witch in this movie? I really don't like this movie. It has nothing to do with the rest of the series. A factory produces masks with a computer chip installed on them that turns children's heads into snakes and insects. What the heck is the purpose of that! This movie should be on Mystery Science Theatre 3000."
0, Gruesome...: Well
0, Halloween 3 is a classic... piece of Garbage!!!!: Halloween 3 is the worst horror flick ever made
0," Why?... Why?: How they could call this movie ""Haloween"" I don't know. I understand that was Carpenters Idea"
1, Charles Mann's 1491: well-written and fascinating: My first purchase for my Kindle FireKindle Fire
1, Good Read: This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting.
1, Good overview of pre-columbian world: I have not kept up with recent research in pre-columbian america
1," ""1491"" by Charles C. Mann: Every chapter was a revelation about the demographics of North and South America before Columbus. Most american indian populations were agricultural with substantial population centers with running water and covered sewers"
1, Over the top: I liked the author's story but I can't believe all the things that he assumes for what was happening in the Americas before 1492.
0, Droll and Boring: If you'd like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and Latin american cultures than this is the book for you. Dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing. However
0, book was destroyed.: content is great! the company that sent it to me
1, A must for hard house fans: Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance)
1, 7 episode DVD: Jamie Oliver's original TV show is superb
1, Tent play: Easy to set up. Big enough for several kids to play in. Does take up a lot of room. Just be careful with the rods when setting it up. We did get a tear. Overall
0," Shine: I bought ""Shine"" and found that the sound was inaudibly small with maximum volume control. So I complained and got a new copy which turned out to be the same.For this dvd of a story of a mentally unstable genius pianist the sound is the most crucial but it failed.I advise you that you should have checked the quality of sound before you put on this item for sale."
0, Not my kind of movie.: Too slow
1, Very nice color: I bought these for my daughter to use before a dance. SHe used 2 towels ( she said they fell apart) but the color was very nice. She is very fair with red hair and I thought the color looked very natural. I will be using these this summer.
0, Tales of Alhambra.: Multiple pages missing ie
1, Wonderful!!: I bought this tent for my 16 month old for Christmas. We were so excited when it arrived that we put it together early! We bought it for $24 and I think we're definitely getting our money's worth! Very durable
0, too small!: We bought this toy to replace a tent that was falling apart (that our kids loved and used in the house). This one was way too small. Good for one kid only.
0, Chinese phone: The keyboard
0, A bit much?: While I appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume
0, There are no illustrations: I was very disappointed when I realized that this version does not contain the illustrations or maps. I had planned on my fifth grader using this for history.
1, If you're having a hard time letting go
1, Good Bike Rack: Bought this bike rack and it works perfect. Amazon was running it on a deal so I like that I got it for even cheaper than it was originally posted. My only complaint is that if your bike isn't shaped just so the bike sits a bit funny on the rack. It still works but you have to secure it from a bar that fits into the plate.
1, .A Call for Rationalism in Religion: The patriotic writer and essayist of the American and French Revolutions sets forth his beliefs on the place of religion in society. He affirms the need for rationalism in religion
0, Dissapointed in cover and description: Looking at the book's cover and at the now defunct editor's description
1, One of the best: This is probably my favorite album of all time. I purchased it about 8 years ago and listen to it regularly. Can't understand a single lyric from it (a few excepted) but it remains one of the best I own. It is soulful
0, Waste of money
1, The best book in the series: This was a awesome book
0, Beginning of the end of American leadership in sciences: The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.Shame.
0, Please guys
0, Could be better!: The reader of this story was hard to follow because there was no difference in the voice of each charater. I found this hard to listen to and understand
0, Iagogo: As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young
1," Shakespeare ""King henry IV Part 1 with notes."": Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing. Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare. This book is more than a college textbook"
0, Horrible fragrance: They use the same base fragrance in all of these shower/hand gels and it is nasty. I don't know how other reviewers give it such a high rating. I had to use alchol repeatedly to remove the lingering smell from my hands after trying it. Nothing pleasant about this product. How hard can it be to add a natural lime essence to scent a wash gel? Camille Beckman uses some kind of artifical scents instead. Yuk.
0, ZOOM IN OR OUT: Alvin Lee Zoom album is a non pretentious work
1, Perfect combination for adults and children: Even though my four year old wasn't ready for the entire movie
1, Keurig Green Mountain coffee
1, Smooth Cup of Coffee: The Nantucket Blend is one of my favorite k-cup coffees that I've made. It's a medium blend coffee that tastes great with flavored creamer or just regular creamer or milk. I will definitely buy more of this one.
1, Fit my fuel pump canister exactly: The original Bosch fuel pump died in my 1991 Saturn after 20 years of service. a Replacement part was $600
1, Woderful and memorable.: I watched this series when I was ten years old. I was astounded by the cinematography. It might have not been as advanced as today's movies but

1, legendary: I don't care how much Elgar you have
0," The worse movie since ""The English Patient."": I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie. This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-("
1, Very good: Who said that this movie was based on historycal facts ?? : So what's all the BS from the over reviewers about a gladitor woould never do this or that ; an emperor blablablablabla...... If you want history go to the library and get a book ! If you want great action
1, Roma: Ben Hur
0, AVOID this BD Release of Gladiator!: The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague
1, Gladiator: This is by far my favorite movie! Russell Crowe's acting is superb. All parts of this movie are fasinating and entertaining. I would recomend this movie to ANYONE. If you haven't seen it yet
0, Upscaled DVD is better!: I don't have to say it
1, THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!: The Best MOvie I have even seen. Great directing and acting! Has everything you want
0, GREAt movie BAD blu ray: i love this movie more than love itself. it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period. BUT the quality of this blu ray is garbage. wait until the re-release or just get the DVD ...to bad it looks so awful...great movie
1, An epic like no other: I worked for the most well-known entertainment company in the world
0, Blu-Ray at Best Quality or Bust: Seriously
1, Awesome movie almost amazing picture: Awesome movie
1, Stunning
0," Barely Palatable: I believe this is one of the top 10 over-hyped films in recent years--enough hype to garnish a Best Picture from the self-lauding Acedamy. In all of the two hours of so-called ""honor"" ""courage"" and ""loyalty"
0, Potential unrealized: Knowing that the movie would be (basically) historically inaccurate
0, rubbish: this comes from an action fan
0, poor recording: Have not been able to watch it as the picture and noise (not movie noise) is so bad. Sorry
0, This Blu ray will NOT work on Australian (region B) players: Hello everyone
0, Wait for it to be done right: I watched and compared the Blu-ray to my DTS DVD. Don't support this kind of crap transfers. I will wait for this to be done right. I gave it two stars only for the audio. The video is really annoying!
1, Maximus!!!: It is a great tale
1, 2001 Best Picture and 10 other Oscars: Simply the best picture of 2000 and perhaps for years. This is an instant classic... Russell Crowe sits with the greats like Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston. Get this DVD... even better get Ben Hur and Spartacus and have a Roman Marathon.
0, Just Buy the DVD: Don't believe all the five star reviews this release has received
1, Classic: Gladitor is a must have in any movie collection. It is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of BRAVEHEART.
0, Quite Sub-Par: I cannot seem to get over the fact that Russel Crowe won an Oscar for this! He swung a sword around for 2 hours
1, Worth it just for the 7 minute montage of missing scenes: Well worth the money. There are 25 minutes of deleted scenes
0, Disappointing!!!: Having heard so many wonderful things about this film
0, Artificial
0, WAT??......ANOTHER EDITION?????: IT REALLY STINKS!!!FIRST IT WAS SINGLE DISC
0, Disappointing: This movie could have been great. Russell Crowe is
0," Zero stars - DO NOT BUY Amazon selling you broken/inferior product: I will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the Gladiator Blu-ray - please read the other reviews for a technical explanation. Suffice it to say there is a ""new"" version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an ""old"" version that is junk. The old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected.But guess what"
1, A good action flick: Not the deepest movie of all time
0, Poor Video Transfer: This is an absolutely terrible transfer. It is ridden with edge enhancement (halos on contrasting edges) and severe noise reduction (smoothing the image to reduce film grain -- AND detail). This is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible. It's barely an upgrade over DVD
0, Warning Will Robinson!! A disaster of over the top DNR & EE; What were they Thinking?!: As mentioned by other reviewers the video transfer of the Blu-ray edition of Gladiator has been reduced to VHS quality and suggest anyone hire's & views before buying but recommend all stay well clear (as this is a lemon) - if you absolutely must have it regardless of quality do so at your own risk. I'm sticking with my DVD edition for now. For more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the AVS Forum & the review at The Digital Bits - looks like we will all have to wait a couple of years until the studio's concerned with this release (Paramount & Universal) do a new edition and remaster the original without all the excessive DNR
0, Gladiator [Blu-ray]: If you love this movie
0, Good Movie
0, Rip-off: Why not issue the extended edition (177 minutes) in a set with the theatrical release? A rip-off
0, A Braveheart wanna-be. Shame on you
1, Gladiator stretches the bounds of believability...: The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against 10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.
1, 5 star movie 5 star DVD: I LOVE this movie. It's powerful
1, Absolutely flawless: A magnificent and wholly believable performance by Russel Crowe. You;d almost want to pick up a gladius and follow him yourself!
0," Shockingly bad: I must have seen some kind of ""director's cut"" of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like"
0, Ugh! I finally gave up!: This book was so awful I couldn't make it past page 60. The plot was boring. The sentences drag on and on endlessly. I kept waiting for something that made sense...I didn't find anything and finally threw the book down and gave up. I will not read anymore of this book or the series!!!!
1, Another Reader looking for Another Adventure: When i first got this book from the library i put it down after 3 pages. At the time it had looked to me like a big

1, Diane Duane is BRILLIANT!!!: I waited for MONTHS to find this book
0, Sad to say I didn't like this book... I really wanted to
0, bla: I thought that this book was just kind of boring. The part with the white dwarf star that was hicoughing up all sorts of things was the only funny part
0, not so good: this book has a good title
0, It's no Harry Potter: If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series
1, And there goes my birthday money....: I love this book. It is a great: a little like Harry Potter only has more of an adult plot a.k.a. more complicated. I feel in love with this book and immediatly bought Deep Wizardry
1, Accurate readings: This product appears to be accurate and was fairly easy to install. I would like larger print on the screen as it is hard to read at a glance (the numbers are large enough
0, Deep Wizardry: This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point.
1," Romance and Laughs Abound!: I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic ""Beauty and The Beast"" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most ""wounded"" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!"
1, Sweet romance: This was my first read my Teresa Medeiros and it won't be my last. I enjoyed the character development - Gabriel was a great tortured hero. This one had a plot twist that totally surprised me.
1, Dear old Nolan!: Philip Nolan
1, Bragg Books are the Best!: The Braggs have so much solid time-proven info for optimal health!Each one is jam-packed with valuable self-care info
1, An Excellent Film Noir
1, El Cano...One of the best!!: I became a big fan of El Cano Estremera when he sang for Bobby Valentin. El Cano is a great sonero and one of my all time favorites. This is a nice album from one of the best.
0, Weak
1, Basic FireWire Card: This card was easy to install in my Windows 7 desktop. Didn't need to download/update any driver software. This card comes as low-profile and ships with the standard-size bracket. The sockets for both the 6-pin and 4-pin connections are very close to the edge (at least on the low-profile version
0, One Of The WORST Films I have Ever Seen!!!: I cannot believe that there are actually reviewers who actually Liked this film! This Film was a Mammoth FAILURE on ALL LEVELS! The Script was terrible

0," We'll Always Have Parrots: I agree with Pork Chop T. Boring. No character development and a weird repetition of what would hopefully been a plot. I added a collection on my Kindle called ""Rejects""."
0, Not as Good as previous: I loved the first book in this series
0, WHY!?: The original was a sexy and track performed by a half decent R&B; group. RL and Next could really hit it off any make people want to dance. It was a good track in 98 and I think would be Next's biggest track.And theres this - a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an R&B; group. Blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success.They dont add anything to the song
1, The Plague of Life: The Plague is an example of great existentialist writing. AT time the novel is slow moving
1, A Stunning Acheivement of Existential Genius: This masterful work portrays with elegant simplicity the existential condition of man. Suitable for readers who have never read an existential Camus novel or for experts in metaphysics
0, Not an Introductory Text: As an accompaniment to the program MacLogic for an upper level course I can see where this book would have a place. Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written
0, Not worth the money: I purchased this product because I was interested in a cooling fan setup for my 360. The SOLE reason I purchased this particular Cooling stand was because of the Green LED lights on the base of the stand. I just received the unit today and the lights

0, Sick! Sick! Sick!: I don't know what you people see in this movie
1," Viddy well!: With all of the mediocre crap such as ""Titanic"" and ""Ever After"" polluting the theaters and sending audiences into a frenzy"
1, This is quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.: I have seen this movie at least 40 times
1," ""There Was Me"": Great movie! Stanley Kubrick is personaly my favorite director after watching this movie. After I read the book I went out and bought the movie without seeing it. I think that the movie is as good as the book. The only downside to the whole movie is it did not add the additional chapter like in the book. But even the ending to the movie is great! Kubrick really scored big in this movie. Back then to make a movie as hard core as this one was crazy but he did it. This movie is so ahead of it's time. But it's my favorite movie of all time!"
1, Made a big impact: It's quite a while since I saw this movie
1, simply a masterpiece: On so many different levels does this movie
1, The best in ultra violence: If you have never seen this movie
0, a very uneven movie: Even though there were occasional brilliances
0, It's COLOMBIAN
1, Love that can't be stopped: Susanna Baird enjoyed traveling with her writer grandfather
1, Passionate and moving: I am very impressed with this film. I am a Catholic and generally happy with that fact
1, Worth watching: The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good
1, Great Movie: Very enjoyable movie that is rather accurate historically on the big points. It showed Luther as a man tormented by his demons as he tried to stay faithful to the Word of God.
0, Luther movie (VHS): As the teacher of a women's Bible class in a Lutheran church
1, Good Movie: This is a good movie and a decent portrayal of Luther. The plot is well done for the volumes of information covered
1, Very accurate: This is a very accurate presentation of Luther and the events that happened. I have read a couple of church history books and this movie is almost verbatem.
1, Teacher: I am teaching some young preachers from out of my church and personally used this book when in Bible college over 35 years ago. It is a great book
0, It Broke after 1 month's use: Worked well at first
0, bally ab tightener: piece of junk...a toy compared to 60 second ab machine.broke so quickly
1, LOOKS REAL!: I ADORE IT! I HAVE A SIZE 5 RING FINGER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON. THIS RING CAN FOOL YOU THAT IT COULD BE REAL. THE METAL HAS NOT TARNISHED OR TURNED MY FINGER COLORS AND SO I FEEL IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
1, Bigger Than I Expected: If you are looking for a ring with a dainty stone this isn't the one. This ring has a ROCK. I wasn't expecting the stone to be so big
1, very detailed account of Nureyev's life: Although verbose and extremely detailed
0, Doesn't work.: Trust me
0, PUA Book Order (The System): Small book with somewhat large type
0, The System: How to get ripped off today!!: The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today.
0, Buddha-Lounge: As bland as white bread. It is a misrepresentation to link this series of 3 CDs in any way to the Buddha Bar CDs or the chillout music category in general. It could play in the background without anyone ever raising their head or moving their body. If your thing is New Age music this might be for you. Everyone else is forewarned.
0, Total waste of money!: It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body
0, Returned: Couldn't get enough channels (even with purchase of an external antenna) to make it worth the price.
0, Without their Kabuki face makeup
0, WOW: If everyone actually listens to the words in all the songs they will see that each has a special meaning that deals with real life. Not exactly like the KISS of 20 years ago but things do change. Cd song quality is excellent. Thumbs up guys!!!!!!!!!!!!
0," SOFT AND PREDICTABLE: The attempt to make another Destroyer fell very short. The title track is easily the best song on this album. It was obvious right away that Peter Criss wasn't playing on it....he does't have that kind of talent so why go in and make this album at all? Before it even came out you knew that Peter would be singing a ballad. ""I Finally Found My Way"" is no ""Beth"" or ""Hard Luck Woman."" The rest of it is just too soft. There is no heavy drum sound. It almost like a weak Lick It Up minus the better songs. Get back with Eric and Bruce! Don't worry about makinganother Destroyer. I'll be satisfied with another Revenge."
0, Classic Kiss? Nope!: Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes
1, i give it a solid 4 stars: I think this is a solid kiss album.about 4 of the songs stand out as some of my favorites.i just listened to it after about 4 years the only thing i hate is the sound quality.the highs are tinny and the bass is so flat.but i guess thats cds for ya!i wish this came out on vinyl!
0," Pandering to ""new"" fans.: I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs"
0, What a joke!: I was a huge Kiss fan
1, ¡Tengo un alma caribeña!: Even if you've never been to Caribbean
0," Hummm... Not too much: I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection"
0, Always room for improvement: I bought this album after hearing Where The Party At? I still regret it. The only other song I like is Cut Somethin'. All the other songs sound too much alike and the slow jams are a million miles from being creative. All they sing about is breaks up. Do any of their relationships work??????? Basically
1," this cd is tha best: when i first bought this cd the only song i bought it for was ""where the party at?"" after listening to tha whole thing every song became my favorite. tha ballads kick and the fast songs are indredible its an awesome cd everyone should get it fa sho"
1, John M. Keane - Music!: Yes
0," The Number is Zero: What a waste of paper and time! There is much talk of how Eisenberg has hit ""the sweet spot"" with this book -- bah! Humbug! Sweet nothings is more like it. Entertainingly and personably written"
1, Every worker should read this book: This is a great book for anyone 20+
1, An important read for anyone concerned about retiring: This book is well worth the time to read
0, Pointless and depressing: I thought that I was doing ok financically until I read this book. There is little or no financial insight or direction to this book.I really never got the point. It makes you feel that unless you are worth a minimum of 10 million dollars you might as well check into the poorhouse. I kept reading hoping to get the point and it was never there!
0," Killer of SSX!!!!!!! :(: Every other SSX game was amazing. This one was very disappointing. I was at a store and I was thrilled to see it on the shelf. I spent (wasted) 40 dollars on this and started playing the second I got home. The music was horrible. The graphics were good. I hated the gameplay.This is baisically the game. There's ""The tour"" and your trying to get in 1st place. You get a better rank every time you beat a challenge. Another thing I dont like about this game is that you make a guy but you cant be any of the classic characters. Well you can unlock them but thats only for 2 player. And whenn you race against them in 1 player they are completely different. Like for example You have to race against Nate ( From SSX 3) And instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something.And the point is that if you like the SSX seiries dont get this game."

1, April Morning is a MUST READ for all Americans: It may start out boring but inside is the intense in-battle story against the British. This Revolutionary War story is about a young boy named Adam who sees his father and friends murdered on the battle line at Lexington. Together Adam
0, Hieroglyphic maps: The Joy of OrigamiThis book is colorful and seemed promising for a beginner to self teach. The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step

0, Joe - Oh No!: As a Joe Jackson fan
1, Good: It was a bit more pinkish-red than I had thought (the lava and the liquid) but it's still pretty and enjoyable.
0, Unreliable Quality: I've got one of those and it was so cloudy that I was hardly able to see the lava. Plus the lava didn't move at all after several tries. I was very dissatisfied and returned the item
0, elizabeth and alexandra: This is not the book for people interested in the Romanovs.Its a silly

0, Good movie
1, This movie was so funny!: I think that anybody that has a sense of humor would really like this movie. My brother rented it and i fell off the couch like 3 times because I was laughing so hard.
1, A TRULY UNDERATED COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did. In my opinion it was a truly fun film. It had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy. Matt Stone And Trey Parker had so much fun doing this. I could not stop laughing at Dian Bachar. He was incredibly funny as Squeak. Don't miss out on this film. Funniest movie of 1998.
0, Movie history in the making!: Move over Star Wars and make room for this fabulous and wicked movie
1, hilarious: This movie is hilarious!!!!!!!! I saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing.

0, ok
1, Best American Literature: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature.McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul. Her's is a story of human wants
1, Loved it.: This book
0, Did it really take all these pages to detail......nothing?!?!?!?: Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty
1, For those who love to read
0, I Tried: I've read so many of Oprah's book selections and for the first time - I am truly disappointed.I am unable to finish the novel. It moves slowly
0, Disappointed: I was also disappointed with this book. I heard Oprah talking about how great it was
0, I agree - its BORING: I wish I would have read these reviews before I picked up the book at the local booksellers. I kept waiting for something good to happen
0, Unremitting Bleakness of Life: I coudn't stop thinking while I was reading this
1, How to Study Your Bible: This is an excellent book. Very helpful if you are unsure how to study a your Bible or if you have been haphazard in doing so. It has made and will continue to make my time alone with God more inclusive

1, famous arias: I purchased this a few years ago and found it extremely useful. Now I cannot find the original and am ordering another copy. I found it practical
0, Good concept - Bad Execution: This kid acoustic guitar looks really nice
0, Product is misrepresented: This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included. The product details are misleading and although the price is good you do not get what you think you are paying for.
1, Strong Material: This is a very strong effort that deserves to be rewarded with higher sales than it has logged so far. Breach is at its best when it is focused on the relationship between people
1," The opposite of ""Ten"": Pearl Jam have changed considerably since 1991's debut ""Ten"""
0, They've lost it: Pearl Jam died
0, a poor job by a great band: i bought this album because i am a big pearl jam fan. when i first listened to it i was suprised how boring it was. i figured i just needed to let it grow on me so i listened to it again a couple of days later. unfortunatley i found that it was still monotonous and the songs tend to run together because they sound so similar. i still think pearl jam is a great band with a lot of talent
1, Doing the Evolution: In some respects
1, Binaural My view: Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron. It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele. Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music. In 1998 they released the album Yield. Songs like In Hiding
0, The band that just won't go away: This has to be the most boring album of all time. Right up there with Yield
0, A valient effort: Remember the days when Pearl Jam was good? back in good-ol-days with nirvana and other grunge bands.This was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort. I hate to break the news to everyone but Pearl Jam is dead
0, Santana has done it again... eh... literally!: Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album

0, If you use an iPod and a PC forget this CD!: You cannot transfer music from this CD to iPod if you are using a PC.That alone is enough to turn me off
0, Rootkit: Because this disc installs a rootkit that slows down your PC and makes your PC easy to hijack by hackers I am not going to order it. Sony and Santana can keep their Copy protected CD!

1, Great C.D.: I love this c.d. Nine Days are absolutely great. They have depth and meaning to all their songs and though some people have said that all the songs sound alike
0, Biased
0, Where is Rod?: Where has Rod Stewart gone? This is so bad that I couldn't even finish listening to the CD. I am such a big Rod Stewart fan
1," Loved this album: We love this album. SO glad we did not read the negative reviews or we probably would not have bought it. We heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered it. We take it with us on car trips and love to sing along. It is a peppy and a fun companion for the car. We would have given it 5 stars if it had ""Leave Virginia Alone"" on it. That was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy. If you like the songs on the album"
1, Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time- Rod Stewart: Rod is always good. I liked this because of the songs. Not a bad one on it. He did good. Good driving music.
0, Rod adds nothing to these classic tunes: As someone else wrote in review
0, Cool Breeze: This Honeywell product is excellent. It works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze.I believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty
0, Warn the neighbors and stick cotton in your ears: My 15 year old 4 speed oscillating fan stopped oscillating
1, Superb Story: I enjoyed this book. There were mysteries inside of mysteries and it was fun to read
1, A book to live by!: In my yoga classes
1, Yoga for thinkers: As one who has never attended a Yoga class
1, ONE IN A MILLION: Rolf Gates' book is the kind of blessing that only comes around with the regularity of Haley's Comet. By his blending of quotes
1, Great Story
1, Just like Nancy Drew: Great story for a quick read by the same author who wrote many of the Nancy Drew books.The entire Penny Parker series is dated in the 1940's
0, No Rubber Seal: I figured that a gas cap like this would ship with a rubber seal on the inside. It does not. Had to makeshift a rubber seal. Really a big bummer.
1, dry floors: We love the Water Boy water dish.No longer constantly mopping up after our dog drinks. We have given one to our daughter for her dog and she loves it.We are buying more for other family dogs and want a spare for us when the summer comes
0, Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds: I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However
1, Nice.: Great to have a large capacity water container that is made to minimize spills. Good for travel and kennel recommend to all who travel.
1, Great travel water bowl: I am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated. I would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too! If you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill
1, Incredible!: The name of this book is what caught my eye
1, Novice user
1, Great book to learn banjo!!: I bought it as an extra book and have used the same book for years (mine was deteriorating) and have shown it to many friends to use when they express an interest in learning to play the banjo. It is a great book. I love it.
0, Retraction! Company fixed CD Works Great now!: The company fixed the CD and sounds great now! Great company to work with. Very responsive. Would definitely buy from them again!Would definitely give them 5 stars but Amazons review editing system won't let me change my rating!
1, Worked like a charm!: Wasn't sure what was wrong with my ice maker
0, GE=No Good: GE neglects to inform you that you need a special 1/4 inch saddle valve! It cost me 150.00 for a diagnosis with out putting it on. If your cubes are hollow or slushie this is the problem. I contacted GE with 502-452-4205 they dismiss the problem and cost. I will never buy GE again!
0, A HUGE Disappointment: I have to admit this CD is my most major disappoint so far this year. There just doesn't seem to be much energy left in GVSB. I've always suspected that Scott McCloud was the real talent behind this group
1, Guitar: Great guitar to buy if you want to save some money on a beginner guitar. Acoustics are always a good first guitar it helps you develop fundamentals. And it sounds great for the price.
1, Penguin: The real pictures in this book are great! It describes the life cycle of a penguin in easy-to-understand words.
1, Los Mocosos does it again!!!!!!!!!!!: Los Mocosos is a very unique band with strong latin roots from the Mission Dist. If you are a fan of Santana
0, Waste of money and dangerous Steroids too: This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.
1, hooks the brillant: this is a throuogh explanation on the state of the African American. it is a worthwhile book for anyone intersted in African Amrican people. it is a brillant book writtn by a brillant writer. it worth buying and reading it.
0, Poor Sound Quality for the price: Compared to Shure's E2cs
0, Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones: They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones. They are also priced like they are. However
0, Comfortable but ...: These are very comfortable
0, Wrong item received: I ordered the hardcover book pictured at a price of $66. I received a paperback with a cover price of 95 cents! Waiting to hear from the seller.
1, ceramabryte scraper: This tool is small for nice storage and use. The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it. The razor appears to be replaceable.
0, Not Worth the Money - Skip It!: This book is a waste of money. It contains dated information and it is not well organized. You could find better data on Google.I was looking for a list of addresses for softball and volleyball players and there is no place in the book to find names that are grouped by sport.Save your money - take a few minutes and look up the information yourself. A real mess!
0, The book was mostly just boring.: A few of the chapters were interesting. I liked the ones about slave revolts
0, Hypocrite Lecteur!: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
0, Not funny. No real plot. Poor satire. Not well written: I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor
0, A lot of syrup: This DVD has a few really enjoyeable songs. It is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough. There are some good history points and traveling interest Daniel explains and good scenery of Ireland which make the video palatable. Too much video footage is of Daniel himself. I would recommed buying this DVD if you can get it for a low price.
0, Works for 6 weeks: This unit broke
0, Do not buy: I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working. Save your money and buy something else.
0, Not worth it.: I purchased this in February 2012. It died in late July 2012. In that span of time I had used the gun perhaps 7-8 times for a total of no more than 2-3 hours of cumulative use. Then last Saturday the gun just died. I happened to notice a bit of sparking though the vents in the lower housing and then that was all they wrote for the heat gun.It does have a 2 year warranty
0, Nice toy
0, Not a top quality blackjack toy for the money: The blackjack game does not exhibit odds. You can't double-down on multiple hands (Las Vegas permits you doing this). The hit button is overly sensitive--two cards are dealt instead of one. I question about the true randomness of the cards dealt.
0, XR41s and Tri-whammers: Okay so I made those words up. They're not actual military terms. Buried in this Tom Clancy book though
0, A good idea made into a bad novel: This novel is very long and boring.When Clancy describes the submarine battles
1, Greatest contemporary war story ever written: I read this book while stationed in Germany in the late eighties and its still one of the greatest reads I've ever had....The story is so believable
0, Severe Printing Errors: I have not yet read the entire book
0, crap: This was pretty crap none of the kids like them and they are not amazing at all. My kids threw them in the trash first day
0," its a rip off.: There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say ""rub here.""Everything else was crap.And a waste of time.I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there.If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money."
0, Not A Toy: It's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume. The purple color comes off in a strong breeze. Therefore it is very overpriced. Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined
1, Zumo 550: The Zumo works great. It's well built
1, Great for Motorcycle: If you ride a bike you need one of these. The only complaint I have is with the bluetooth. It has two channels of bluthooth but has a very limited amount of phones that it will work with. Most of them are very old model. If you hook up a phone not on the list it will pair up but if you also pair up a headset then it goes crazy. Once I found an old phone (Motorla RAZR) it works great.
1, Takes a licking and ...: I take the unit off the bike every time I stop(I don't trust the locking screw).One time I did not fully secure the GPS into the cradle.While going down the road at 50+ miles per hour it flew off.I thought great there's $600 down the drain.I circled back and picked up the device.It was banged up in a few places (the corners were completely scuffed).I turned it on and it WORKED!I have fully tested it and everything works (it's now 15+ days since the incident).All-in-all a good GPS for those of us who are a little rough on our hardware.
0, Broke down in 3 weeks: Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.
1, Great GPS: Even though the price is more than what I wanted to pay
1, Love it: Though the price is something you have to consider most
1, So cute!: This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far. Everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully
0, the big town (vhs): My Husband wanted the movie on dvd but all I could find was vhs so I ordered it for him he loved it the first time he watched it but the second time he tried to watch it it wouldn't work . It would not trac.
1, An interesting lady: This was a good book. It was a bit long
0, Not the Sims 2: I do not like this game at all. The graphics are awful. I even like the first Sims for the Playstation than this one. I feel I was ripped off paying $50.00 for this farce. I have the Sims 2 for the PC and all the expansion packs and I love that game. I feel like I'm getting somewhere on that one. You can't shut the aging off so don't know if on this game they age or not. Don't know if the they even have kids and if they age or not. Also they work 7 days a week just like in the first one. I don't recommend anyone buying this one. I wouldn't buy any of the other ones they have either because if they are anything like this one it's just a rip off.When I went to make people I didn't get many choices on anything and the people looked and walked just like they did on the first one. They should never have called this one Sims 2 because it sure isn't.
1, From jazz to eternity: Starting with some hot but slightly populist swing
1, Gimme a piece of BEEFCAKE!!: Beefcake is a documentary and a gem of a movie all rolled into one. Its focal point is the physique magazines of the 40's and 50's. The director shows the steamier and more homoerotic side (as if it needed more of one) of these magazines. It also covers how they came to be and why they dissappeared off of magazine shelves. Before watching the movie i knew very little about it except that it was gay themed and discussed muscle boys. Even though i really couldnt care less for muscle boys
1, Stamina Electronic Mini-Stepper: The stepper is tough to use at first but that's probably because I'm out of shape. I've used it several times but not on a regular basis. The only probably I have is that it's hard to maintain your balance at times. Otherwise
1, A Great must have book: This thing really works. I tried the exercises and noticed HUGE improvement in my memory and the ability to visualize things in a way I had never dreamed before.
1, Best Book!: This is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning!!! After only 15 minutes
0, Can You Say - Stuffing The Ballot Box?!?: At the time of this writing
0, Pseudociencia: Este libro y el sitio mantenido por Win Wenger son un claro ejemplo de la pseudociencia al estilo de la Dianética y la Cientología. Tengan cuidado con otro ejemplo de pseudo ciencia: Tony Buzán y sus mapas mentales. Todos estos ejemplos tiene como común denominador prometer hacerlo más inteligente de lo que es. Creanme
1," Not bad: The technique of ""Image Streaming"" has shown promising results in certain cases. Much of the hype and propoganda"
1, DYNOOOO-MITE: I love this CD - Weezer and Pavement fans listen up - this CD is for you! The band uses topics such as supermodels (Dear Kate)
1, Decent CD: The Remake of Boyz-n-the-Hood makes this CD worth buying by itself
1, Impress Your Friends: Here is a golden opportunity for fans of alternative music to look terribly intelligent...buy this CD now
1," Thank God there's a place ""ware"" I can find this on CD: Great album from great singer. I first heard it just a few weeks ago when I found an original 1979 cassette copy from a place near my house that specializes in records and old tapes. In almost no time the disco-ish ""What's Your Name"" became one of my very favorite songs."
0, Bad Remake: This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone. Jessica Simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song. None of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end. Unfortunetly
0, Dropped it and it broke: I bought the 810 model
0, Don't do it !!: The first time I tried this
0, Disappointed: I'm a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd. It didn't capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show.
1, The Importance of Community Development: Through statistical and qualitative analysis
1, Good overall account of the war in the South: I recommend this book for those interested in a clear ande concise narrative account of the American Revolution in the South. Although not as dramatic as Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE (which I do not recommend) Lumpkin's book is well worth reading and generally accurate. His analysis is solid
0, Good idea
1, An overlooked treasure: This is one of the funniest SF books out there. I've got an old tattered copy
1, One of the greatest jazz records ever!: I absolutely love Tom Grants music and this record (the view from here) is a fantastic album...infact one of his best! I have seen Tom Grant live many times and he is an amazing performer and puts on an amazing live show..For anyone who buys this CD you will not be disappointed...It is truely a great cd and Tom Grant is one of the all smooth jazz greats!Regards
0, Animated Dean Martin Doll: I really find it difficult to rate this item for the following reason. I purchased the Dean Martin doll as a novelty item for my wife
1, My daughter loves these books!: I was given our first book by Sandra Boynton as a gift when my daughter was just 6 months old. I have since then bought several more of her books and my daughter loves each.and.every.one of her books that we own! Sandra Boynton's books were literally the first books that really caught my daughter's attention and we read them every day. She is almost 8 months old now and I think she'll love them as she grows older as well. I highly recommend any of her books!
0, This book is awful!: This book has no point to it. It teaches you common sense stuff. It has no value in real life. This book is very boring and useless. A student can not read this book
1, Excellent strategy game!: I got this game for my birthday (I'm 35) and I love it! It's like a high-tech version of chess. Definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance. It's especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively. If you like classic strategic boardgames
0, CHEAP!: I was really excited about getting this for my brother for Christmas
1, It makes you think: It makes you think really hard - its like chess on crack. Its the new age of chess. I don't like the form fitting box top which required resetting the pieces in a certain way to put away the game
1, 9yo Son loves this game: I will start off by saying I have not personally played this game. I don't really like chess so am not super excited to play. But my son really wanted this for Christmas. I was a little leary of getting it because we have had laser games that didn't work very well in the past and ended up being a waste of money. But there wasn't much he wanted for Christmas and the reviews on Amazon were good so I got it for him.He loves it! Him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since Christmas and they are both addicted to it. My boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son isn't around. The lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working.It also seems to be very fast play. I don't think it takes them more than 20 minutes to finish a game.And I love the fact that it isn't something that has to be plugged into a TV to play and it makes you think and strategize.
1, One of the all-time best jazz singers: In the pantheon of jazz greats
0, not for me: A reasonable price and a good beginning but what seemed to be a thriller turned into a slow love story with some mystery thrown in. Wasn't my cup of tea.
1, My first ADF book!: This book was my first exposure to Alan Dean Foster. I though the beginning was somewhat slow
1, little train that couldn't: The batteries don't last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use. It still makes the sounds but no longer moves. I love the train but would never spend this much again.
0, tried today: today was the first day with it. I have noticed no difference in appetite. directions say it may take a few days.It tastes fine.
0, No Taste: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker
0, How do you expect people to purchase this item?: The product description states that the sizing is based on neck size
0, Kindle version is Not illustrated.: It says illustrated
1, A classic with a beautiful wrapping: Wonderful book
0, Great music
0, Disgraceful: This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of an Allman Brothers concert
0, Like others say
1, Any true Allman Borthers fan would enjoy this DVD: The sound and picture quality are great and the selection of tunes are great also. The only annoying thing was the cut in interviews in the middle of a few songs. Overall a good DVD
0," Misleading information on DVD case.: I'm disappointed like the rest. I bought the VHS version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the DVD. WRONG!!! To make matters worse the DVD cover says ""Running Time: Approx. 90 minutes"" The ACTUAL running time is 55 minutes. What a rip-off!!"
0, I am glad I didn't trade in my Laserdisc!: what an incredible botch job! the laserdisc rocks! and I understand so does the vhs version...but this DVD cuts out songs...cuts up songs...and generally dissapoints...THE INTERVIEWS SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO...NOT ..instead off SONY..get it right! and put this out AGAIN!
1, Eye Opening!: Read this book if you don't know anything about the writings of St. Paul so you can get it right straight away. Read this book if you have read others about the writings of St. Paul
0," Not a ""practical handbook"" for today.: This is a reprint of a book first issued in 1930. It does have some fascination"
0, I cannot rate as I have not purchased.: For over $18.00
0, I struggled to pick it up...: Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland. While I found the historical aspect to be informative
1, A Good Family Game: My eight year old son received this gift for Christmas this year and he
1, better than 95% of what's in your CD player: there it was
0, .....what happened?: truly a disappointment. and that's only because Catherine Wheel need to be held at a very high standard. they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past
1, This game is Sweet.: If you want codes I got codes only one but its Sweet.You can get a rocket launcher by typing in this code when your hunting and you don't just want to kill it you want to blow it away that code is BHB-BQ
1, Good for my first pistol: A decent priced case for my first gun. Easily fit a 9mm Sig
0, Good case
1, Great product: I looked at another pistol case in a store that was selling for the same price
1, does what it's supposed to do: Got this for my Ruger P95. Plenty of room for the gun
1, agood quality case: I bought this particular case for my CO2 pistol and was able to get the pistol
1, Excellent for revolver storage: You can't beat this for the price for storing a handgun. I keep a S&W 357 magnum and 3 speedloaders in the case. Quality is good overal plastic. The latches work fine and appear to be decent for plastic.
1, For public radio insiders and those who wished they were.: If you're a public radio fan wanting to know what Garrison Keillor is really like
1, Excellent as a drama on the lives of prostitutes but only fair as a thriller: Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty
0, Welcome to 1995!: I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service. From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that doesn't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router.
1, Pequeño y cumplidor: El Nokia N800 es muy practico para el uso diario por su reducido tamaño
1, Great for my needs: I wanted a device that could give me the web browsing capabilities and mp3 player without the price and weight of a laptop. This fits the requirements well. It requires some tinkering to get things just right. If you don't want to tinker
1, best gadget ever...: im writing this review from my n800 nice device
0, Does not power up after initial charge: This item arrived DOA after initial Charge. The replacement also did not start after initial charge. I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours. Then it worked great until I powered down
1, Great Puzzle: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle. Good chunky pieces that the little ones can handle and all tidies away into a great little case. Well worth the price and makes a great gift for toddlers learning their association and coordination.
1, Fear: From the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat. A thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time. Twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and Mark Walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic. The ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more. An ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering
0, Umm... Nah: Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark
0, Terrible Service: I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one
1, The Very Best: This is quite possibly one of the ten finest Albums/CDs every recorded. The Byrds at this time were the best the 60s had to offer and the 60s was the time period that mattered. The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds
0, not delivered: thanks for nothing. I sent this product to Qatar. now some random guy in Vegas has a new prisma color art set for free. and there is no way I can contact anyone. $230 right Out the window.
0, way too violent for children: we just rented this movie and while my 9-year old liked it
0, Buffalo Girls: The original version of this movie was great. Huston is superb as Calamity Jane
0, North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperbacks Library): This particular printing may be authentic to the period but the print is very difficult to read. It is dizzying.
0, iLuv I707BLK iPod FM Transmitter: This is a neat device and works quite well. DO NOT BUY ONE FOR AN 8GIG 5th GENERATION iPod. YOU WILL HAVE TO EXTENSIVELY MODIFY IT TO FIT. Well
1, still working: I've had this unit now for two years and it still works like a champ for an FM transmitter. There's static on some channels when I travel
1, loved it: my baby is 10 months old and fits very comfortable in this
0," Suggested Age.....6 years??????: I think that the only reason that the manufacturer recommends this ""toy"" for ages 6 and up is to avoid a law suit"
0, Waste of money: It would be safer to have just held my son. We thought this was cool becasue we wouldn't have to blow it up
1, Read the manufacturers recom age!!!: According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!
1, Super fun float for my toddler: My son who is going to be 2 soon simple loves this float. He hates getting into our bath tub and used to cry a lot. So when i came across this float on Amazon i wondered if it will ever be used

Carolyn is surprised that the bride & groom are not involved in the planning at all. Sheik Tarik is planning everything which keeps her wondering why. As they get to know each other Carolyn & Sheik Tarik begin to fall in love. Of course there are misunderstandings but they work them out... until Carolyn learns that the wedding is arranged and against the sister's wishes. There are some good twists and turns throughout the story which keeps things interesting. I enjoyed reading this book and hope you will like it too. There is a sequel to this book on Carolyn's friend Anne called ""Taming the Sheik"" by Carol Grace. One of the sheik's cousins mentioned in this book is the hero in the sequel. Enjoy!"
0," product never worked. manufacturer does not stand behind their product.: This product ruined at least 3 brand new batteries. Amazon refuses to do anything about it and the manufacturer will not stand behind their product. I will never use amazon or a schumacher product again. If the product is ""as is"" I may as well buy it used for a fraction of the cost."
0," Horrified: My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled ""Age Differences"" and I quote ""For the first 6 months"
0, Really pretty lame: There really isn't anything new in here and just states the obvious like don't beat your kids and love them. Not worth the money.
0, A mistake: I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
1, ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE: Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago
1," Quest for fire review: My recent purchase of ""Quest for fire"" from Amazon.com was a great experience. The DVD arrived on time and in very good condition. The film was a joy to see again. the screening went very well"
1, Skechers Chiefs Sneakers: Nice shoes for a good price. Cant beat that for growing boys! And they love the easy on/off style.
1, Good: Does not surpass War All The Time but still pretty f-ing solid. Check out Autumn Leaves Revisited.
0, Kindle version has problems: This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors. I could usually make them out
1, Exactly what we wanted: I found this by scanning the bar code of a friends hat. We got the package quickly and it was exactly what we ordered.
0, Too Much Attitude: Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent
1, The Bishop's Wife: One of my favorite Christmas movies
1, A Beautiful Story: No blood or guts... just wonderful characters showing what love really is ! Don't miss seeing this one if you haven't already. Great for Christmas!
1, gasket cement for Big Green Egg: This is the best cement I've yet used for keeping my replacement gasket in place on my Big Green Egg. I'm now using a fiberglass stove gasket
0, Vague Explanations: This book contains very good practice material but the explanations to the answer choices are very vague and difficult to understand.
0, It's not worth it; it's a waste of time: This is a very good if you need a brush up on the very basics like percentage and fractions. This is the first 200 pages and it is very easy. It gives you a sense of achievement and wrongly makes you think you will ace the SAT. The SAT is not this easy...The harder concepts are poorly explained. Explanations to practice questions and tests are extremely shallow and vague. Some of the techniques are much too convoluted and take too much time. There are better strategies than what this book offers.
0, If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000 TV Movie): THe song of the title menu sung by two women in the same beautiful style of THE FLOWER DUET from LAKMÉ by Delibes
0, Sweetened with Sucralose: Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid. Read all about it online.
0, Would be a better value with quality batteries: Unit worked well for what it is
1, You must have a copy of this book for your own!: I read Cheaper by the Dozen more than 20 years ago in Thai edition. And I bought it to all of my friend for presents. This is a book you must have in your house. Now I am about to buy the original/English version. I still read it every time I found it at the bookstore. I love this book.
1, Charming
1, The book is a masterpice: I have been addicted to this real life story for over 25 years. I've starred as Mother Gilbreth on stage and also directed the production. I will be directing it again because it has everything audiences want...humor
1, NOT for Modern Readers: This book should be read by everyone and anyone who is able to appreciate good Victorian literature
1," Sublime is the Word.: From ""Lady is A Tramp"" to ""How High the Moon"" to her unique improvisation on ""Mack the Knife""...Miss Ella Fitzgerald shows us that she is the jazz vocalist genius of all time. Sublime"
1, Wagner out West: Most of the young stars here perform very well in a high production western that is'nt quite as good as the sum of it's parts. Wagner is'nt bad
1, Worked great: This product worked exactly as I had hoped. I did not feel like I had to keep running to the bathroom. It was controlled and effective.

0, Too Much Like Work: If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century
0, Stereo installition kit - Hyundai: The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces. There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio. Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws. Seems to be holding soo far.
0, African Architecture: Hugely disappointing. This book promises more than it really delivers. Having lived and worked as an architect in Africa

1, One Tree Hill's Road Mix: I only bought this CD because I've been watching One Tree Hill from the very first season (and b/c of that hot James Lafferty
1, Middle Eastern fever: Highly energetic and downright rowdy quartet.It's hard to tell where improv ends & Khalife begins; brilliant~This group obviously plays together seamlessly -- like the Beatles over time.I'm sending JADAL to my percussionist grandson
1," Good horse - PAIN to assemble: The horse seems sturdy but to the person who said it took 15 minutes to assemble they must be superman. My husband and I just finished putting it together for Christmas and it took us at least an hour. The instructions are horrible and the springs are a nightmare to hook together. We never did get the ""safety"" hook in. ADVICE: put on the spring covers BEFORE hooking the safety straps to the wooden pegs. The instructions say the other way around but that is impossible.It does seems sturdy though and I like the sounds. I'm sure our 2 yr old will love it in the morning."

1, bossa carioca: First time I heard this album was sometime 2001.Was i surprised to know that the name did not sound brazilian.Who is this singer with such a light and mellow voice it was just so very pleasing to listen to.I bought the album the following day.Some more albums in the coming days.The albums now are one of my precious collections.Hoping against hope english versions come our way soonest.jun/los angeles
1, A Great Find: A friend wanted this book for Christmas
1, Change the world: I believe this book has the power to transform the way you view life. I am a teacher and I discuss this book in my class. It is always intriguing to the kids. I now raffle it off at the end of the year and I can't tell you how happy the students are to receive it. It opens their eyes to how important their thoughts and feelings are. That is a wonderful gift to give a child.
0, More than just a little bit flaky...: Well
0, A new view of water: Pretty pictures
1, Respect for Life: I saw this book at the Dahn Yoga and Healing Centers where I attend classes. I have had basic and advanced Healing training from Dahn Yoga and our last class was how to make healing water. This book illustrates what anger and violence as well as pollution do to our bodies which are made up of 70% water. My daughter borrowed the book the day after I got it and I am waiting for her to return it. Every human being should read this book and understand how their actions react on other humans. Superb book!
1, Fabulous book for the young reader: This book is based in fact
0, Crap
0, A book for the completist: I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order. Hornblower During The Crisis is an unfinished book

1," correction to a previous review: The word ""robot"" comes from the Czech word ""robota"
0, Disappointed: Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner
0, The author must be an extremely annoying snob.: For a history book
1, Life vest: This is a good quality life vest. I am pleased with the fit and feel. I wear it faithfully on our boat!
1, A mob classic!: This is a great movie! If you are into mob movies
1, great!!: I have never seen this movie
0, COPY: This is just a copy of the movie. It is not an original. The DVD was burned on a DVD-R. The labels are nice but the DVD does not contain any menu features at all.
1, good: this is the best a+ book i have been reading easy to understand and brilliant video plenty of studying about core hardware i wish there was more of it especially about windows.good questions and answers programme pity it stops before you you even reach halfway.thank youpraful
1, No Knowledge to success: I could play games and do word processing. If I had a problem I would reload my computer and start over. I'm retired with such outdated skills and physical disabilities that I was unemployable. Started school at NACC in Burbank
1, Wow
1, A+ review: This is a plain language
1, The best book for A+: I passed the A+ Core 84% and I am going for the DOS/Win this week. This book is very good! Very detail compare with other A+ book.
1, Great!: Great quality for the price and does everything i need it to do
0, Not worth the $$$$: We love the idea of this table but found several main problems:1) Cheaply made-- the legs on aon put his foot through the hole in one of the benches while standing on it
0, Bradbury Something Wicked This Way Comes: Surprised at what a dud this story felt like
1, One of his best: How can you go wrong with a Ray Bradbury story....I sent this to my 17 year old grandson as an introduction to other fiction.
0, It's OKAY: There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature
0, Something Wicked This Way Comes: Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally
1, Loved it!: Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).The novel itself it beautifully written--at times
0, Not For Me...: So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland. I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.
1, Best Book Ever: This may be the best book ever written by a human being. Next to the Bible and Shakespeare
1, Great book!: I think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it. It was a great read lots of info!
1, Emily Richrds needs a recording contract!: I just love her music
1, Specialized area of interest - excellent book: Got it as a gift for one who loves this writer. He enjoyed it very much.
1, Thumbs up!: C-balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor Julian Sprung
0, Too Bulky!: When I put this on my car visor
0, Terrible book: Considering that this book is the 10th edition
0, Not polished or put together very well: I had to buy this book for a Masters degree course. I think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good. The author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration... that's all well and good but a good book does this not make.The price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide. Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to. What a shame...it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from. This is not it in my opinion. It could be done better.
1, Nice item for what it does: I'd used this adapter with my Canon SX30IS to place polaraized
0, Predictable
1," a very delicate writing: A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like ""the Lover"""
0, hard to follow: I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm
0, One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally: I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant

1, Since high school...: I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school. I used to skateboard much more than I do now
1, Great Value: Pants are comfortable Wash and wear well. I am a truck driver and I get very dirty and a lot of things to get caught on. These pant are performing well .
1, Comfort Fit Here.: I bought these Dickies work pants 
1, The First Iron lady?: This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings
0, Poor: No good... as bad as the Curse of the Pink Panther..... unwatchable!Frankly there is only one Peter Sellers and no doubles can compare just as there is only one Herbert Lom without whom there is no Pink Panther either! If you are a fan get the S.Martin remake
1, yeah: french rap at its best! i love it
0, Quit with the ads on the clips already!: WANTED to watch the behind the scenes Jailhouse Rock clip but unfortunately Amazon feels the need to ruin it by peddling Elvis product with the damn pop ups thru the whole thing. Maybe if I could actually enjoy the clip I might buy the dvd. Just because of the annoyance factor I am not. You suck Amazon
0, Speedway: Okay here is my opinion. One of my favorite actors in the whole universe is Bill Bixby. If Bill had not been in this movie
0, Hurts my teeth: These were way too strong for my teeth. I used them as directed and towards the end less than directed. They gave me long term pain in my teeth(about a years worth).
1, Crest Whitestrips: Excellent product.. More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i've ever had in my life ! Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them.
1, amazing product: years ago when the original whitestrips first came out
0, These do NOT work...I promise!: These do NOT whiten teeth. I've tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use
0, Formatting makes this book hard to read: I was excited to read this free book until I received it.Unfortunately there is no table of contents.Some of the punctuation is different from the original. This is distracting and slows the pace of the book.Everything runs together. The entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break.
1, Now I know why it is such a favorite.: I was an English Lit. major
0, Wasnt what I expected: My family has a history of Dyslexia
1, Short & To The Point !: Dover Thrift Editions of Charles Dickens Christmas Classic
0, Poorly done e-book: Beware
0, maybe good but definitely NOT the unabridged recording: once again
0, A Choppily Abridged Carol: Although the artwork in this book is great
1, Couldn&#65533;t put it down: I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools. It is defiantly one of the great classics. It is timeless
1, Loving a Christmas Carol: This audio version of A Christmas Carol was great. The narrator's voice(s) were very interesting. It matched right along with the version of the book I used for my English class. We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story.
1, It was a good book and a short book too: It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie
1, A dickens of a story: I had seen various movie versions
1, Excellent classic: It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
1, Great classic: Very well developed characters and fabulous description make Mr. Dickens such a great writer. Well worth the time on a cold winter night.
1, Vocabulary: The only thin I had trouble with us the language and vocabulary. Other than that it's a very good Christmas story
1, well written: yes
1, Great edition of A Christmas Carol: Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular. As far as I can tell
1, The book showed true family values.: I liked Charles Dickens
1, Holiday classic: This is a good lesson learned book and brings to mind in reading the importance of sharing with joy. All should learn from this book s message.
1, a holiday classic: A good read for the Christmas holidays. A little wordy at times though but that's expected with the period it was written in. It definitely gives you a glimpse into 19th century London and how tough life was.
1, Always a good read!: As fun to read as to watch! While not the true Christmas story
1," Not as great as the other seasons. Still missing Dana... it was great seeing her ""ghost"" in one episode!: I find that the 4th season was not as good as the previous ones. I love all the characters but I did not like Shane moving on so quickly with Paige. She seem to be more the person that Carmen wanted but without Carmen."
0, TOTAL WASTE OF TIME: IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSE ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION BUT I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE. I READ ABOUT 100 PAGES AND TOSSED IT. THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ. HEROINE AGGIE IS SO FULL OF START THAT SHE'S JUST NO LIKEABLE
0, Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever!: First
0," Too much 'Method' in this madness: Method actress Piper Laurie made me laugh out loud when she began the ""Come you spirits"" speech as if she were trying to summon Blanche DuBois and Medea in one go. Can't imagine Mr. Brett's excuse for as abysmally poor acting. For even worse Shakespearean acting (and yes"
1, Book - A Sailors' Valentine by John Fondas - great purchase!: I was thrilled to finally receive my book The Sailors' Valentine. It's a unique book about an old art using shells. The sailors of a century and more ago created the Valentines for their sweethearts. The pictures are fantastic and the octagon shape of the book makes it a perfect table book. I could not find this out-of-print book anywhere but on Amazon.com. I received it in it's original sealed box: it was new listed in the used book section. Thanks
0, One star may be too much. Hack writing at its laziest.: Seriously
1, Replacement blades at a reasonable price: These replacement blades worked great when I needed to repair my AlienFly after flying it into the wall too many times!
1, Good read and easy to understand: This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand
0," Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!: I seriously don't think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got. This has got to be the ""worst"" in search of sunrise series by the `so called #1 dj' Tiesto...The very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy ...which means he cant get the basics right of beat matching. He could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release. (Im sure everyone who bought the cd agrees). Also there is no proper direction in the music. The tunes are not catchy...they are really boring...and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard (except Coca & Villa - La Noche)"
1, It's first European trip was a success!Q: We bought this product as a gift for our friends to assist them in their 40th anniversary trip to Europe. In their return
0, Beware of cost of updates - opnly one free update offered: I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin. Garmin's website stated that map updates were available for Europe and North America
1, A Lot for the Money: Since the 670 is a discontinued model the price reduction on Amazon was tremendous. For less than $320 you get the following features- Spoken street names (although they often indistinguishable via computerized voices)- Bluetooth cell phone reception (with a bluetooth phone which works very well)- FM traffic monitor (of limited usefulness)- US/Canada & European maps (relative up to date; for the latest maps you get one updated map free and the other must be purchased)- Car & a separate home recharger- Front Window mount- Close to 6 million POI's- Car/Truck/Motorcylce/Walking modes- One way point before end destination- Old style flip antenna (instead of built in)- Very bright screen- Speaker could be louder-I took the unit on a recent trip and it was at least 90% accurate with recent (within the year) roads and freeways often not given. Highly recommended.
1, Garmin nuvi 670 review: I've had a Garmin Quest for many years and have used it throughout the U.S. and Europe on many trips. I bought the Nuvi 670 for my other cars. It has improved antenna sensitivity to work better in a city environment
1, You can never go wrong with Bugs and Company: Having grown up with Bugs Bunny I am pleased to see they are still going. My son laughs out loud when we watch it.

0, Bad Edition: I would not buy this edition. The printing is terribly small. Its about half the size of normal print. And there is no introduction. Usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material.
0, Beware: NO 5th BOOK!: The Everyman's Library version is abridged -- without being advertised as so
1, Essential Reading: This is in my top 5 best books of all time. I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics
0, Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack: The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible. The first movie froze up near the end even after I attempted to play it in a second player. The 2nd movie didn't play at all and the third one
1, Burt Reynolds: It came very fast and the quality is very good
0, Diehard fans wondering about the B-side???: Well
0, Incorrect advertisement: You have an advertisement to use the Olympus B-50SU 4 AA NiMH Batteries and charger with the DSC-U10 camera. The DSC-U10 camera uses AAA batteries not AA. Do you have a AAA NiMH battery and charger for the DSC-U10 camera ??? I guess I can use the B-50SU charger for other things that need AA batteries. Please correct your advertisement.
1, Old School Action Movie: I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod
1, Death-wish-3: This is the best death-wish in this one bronson goes head-to-head with a gang that took over a 6 block radious of new york bronsons gun is very cool the ending is great and the music is cool cheak it out.

1," The masterpiece of American song: Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. "" I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth"
1, Where struggle ends and grace begins: I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first
0, Piece of Crap: I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works
0, Leather Flip Cover: The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered. I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken. I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device.
0, Broken hinge mounts: The plastic hinge mount on the cover that I bought to replace the broken plastic hinge mount on the cover that came with my Ique M5 has now broken. I will now buy another and try to reinforce the hinge before it breaks again.Garmin 010-10567-07 Leather Flip Cover for iQue M5
1, It doesn't really do it: This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation

0, can't see it: i have an ipad and a local wifi. i couldn't see the movie as a cloud. i downloaded but each time i tried to see it i received the same message: htttp....... so the movie remains on my ipad unviewed. I would give it a higher rating if i could at least see it.
1, Great live CD: As one other reviewer mentioned finding great live CD's from new wave bands is very difficult. I'm usually not a fan of live CD's but I really enjoy this one. Autumnal Park is one of my all-time favorite new wave albums and I am excited that I get to continue to listen to it live.
0," very disappointed: emailed this company to find out if this was an ""antique"" book"
0, not worth the money: After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on 19-century photography. You are lead to believe that a wealth of information is on hand
0, Relaxing Music?: I was hoping to find some nice calming
1, great product: even though it was damaged in shipping this charger works great and i would recomend it to anyone it charges fast and since it has a fan it does not over heat like most chargers
1, Hex Wrenches: I have used this brand previously at work and have had good luck with them. The coating holds up to daily use and abuse.
1, Best film about art and the artist ever: I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous
1, Mish: This is a hilarious album with all the favourite aspects of the Prairie Home Companion show. Garrison Keillor could read the phone book and it would be funny.
1, Garrison Keillor . . . need anyone say more?: It's a full hour of A Prairie Home Companion
1, All of the books in this series are excellent!: The lessons in the books of this series are classic
1, An Old Favorite: I fondly remember this book that I read as a child over fifty years ago. I was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book. He clearly got the messages Leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so. The terminology and pictures Leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm.
0, HELP ME!: Oh my gosh. I f you are looking for an interesting book to read. Don't read Treasure Island. It is totally on a reading level for way older people. Not 7th graders. I had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that I gave up and fell asleep. Boring Book. I wouldn't even classify it as a classic. I would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep.
1, Stevenson's Best!: This book is the best book i have ever read! i have already read this book 5 times and i will read it much more in my lifetime. Stevenson blends adventure and intrigue splendidly in this fast paced novel about a young boy who receives a treasure map from an old buccaneer
1, A treasure: This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
1," Review of ""Treasure Island"": Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" is remarkably well written"
1, Treasure Island: I read this year's ago and loved it then. I enjoyed reading it again
1," Treasure Island: I thought that ""Treasure Island"" was a very good"
0, Booooooooooorrrrrrrring!!!: I had to read this for a 7th grade class... I got what was happening (mostly)
1, First read: Up until this point I had only ever seem Muppet Treasure Island. This book is actually pretty cool
1, Treasure Island: A classic. Everyone should read this book...and all things written by Robert Louis Stevenson. He is one of my favorite authors of all time.
1, treasure island: treasure islandis an awesome book I just couldn't stop turning the pages. Many people died but its still action-packed with thrills.
1, Treasure island: Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
1, A Great Adventure: I loved this book. I never read this one as a child
0, Good book
1, How could I never have read this before?: This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
1, Classic: Great read. The writing style may be considered a bit dull by today's standards
1, Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.

1, moka brew coffee: Bought this product after drinking great coffee in Amsterdam that was pressure brewed
1, Good book: This product is pretty good. It lists so many websites available. It is mostly aimed at older homeschoolers
1, The only...: I ordered this book simply to replace the original book that has come unbound from years of use. I've been reading cards for close to 25 years now. My first deck was given to by my mother when I was an adolescent. I've come across many decks over the years
1, Rush 2:Better than rush exept for music and tracks.: 22 Cars(including 6 to get from keys
1, Good Movie!: This is a very old movie but it made a deep impact on me because it's very spiritual. This movie teaches how temptation can be deadly. I always like movies that leave you thinking and this one definitely does that. It's sexual in some parts and in other parts it's exciting and filled with suspense. I love to show this movie to my friends because most of them have never seen it before. I would recommend watching this movie on a dark stormy night. :)
1, Women are pure evil: The demon from hell that looked like a woman is praying on single she meets in bars in New York. Everytime she takes a man home with her while she having sex with them she starts to kill them. It takes a christian boy from the south to stop her evil deads.
0, Didn't like the paper quality and presentation: I bought them (Northanger Abbey
1, Definitley worth a read: Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
0, Shoddy quality: My review isn't about the story aspect of the book
0, Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read: I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an 18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies
1, A wonderful novel: Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works
1, An excellent recording from Naxos and Juliette Stevenson: To be absolutely truthful
1, Love Kindle!: Everything was as expected. Timely delivery
0, Not the best: Like all Jane Austin novels
1," Persuasion: Austen at Her Best: Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Ugly Duckling."" How does Anne Elliot deal with her ""faded bloom?"" Throughout the novel"
1, Always a pleasure: Watched the movie 10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well
0, The tape
0, Doesn't work!: Maybe we just got a bad one
1, One of my all-time favorites: Listening to these recordings gives one the same feeling as one would have re-reading love letters that have been carefully tucked away. The very best tribute to Ella Fitzgerald there could possibly be ... Tommy brings these beautiful tunes to life with his incredible style of playing. This isn't a recording just for fans of Ella or Tommy ... it's a must-have for anyone who enjoys good
0, Nice idea - poor quality device
0, Destroyer is Non-Anamorphic

1, Love
0, Forever Breaking-Have Gone Through @ Already!: I received the Keurig B70 for Christmas. I loved it for a few weeks. Then all the problems arose. I called customer service and had to hold for over an hour. They gave me the run around at first but then offered to ship me a completly new machine. I thought that would be the end of it
0, Stopped working properly after 1 week: I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition
1, best b-70: this is my second one B-70 for the money is the best brewing system delivery was fast and free
1, Keurig B70 Platinum: Great delivery service and terrific price! This arrived right before Christmas as gift for my husband. We both are enjoying the coffee maker. We can pick our own coffee choices. It works great. We both love it!!!
1, This was gift: I bought this last Christmas for my Daughter and Son in law
0, Dont waist your time or $$: My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday
0, Price is rediculous..: Costco has the same machine for $145 with 60 k-cups... Just rediculous.. Starting to sigh on amazon.... Prices this season have been jacked sky high...
0, What is the opposite of Green?: In a world where we have floating islands of plastic. How does this type of product even get patented
1, LOVE IT!: I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!
1, Review: Product was shipped on time and arrived as advertised - all works great ......... we were worried initially with the coffee maker as the first few cups of coffee had a metallic taste
1, WOW - MUCH BETTER THAN THE B60!!!: I purchased the B60 about a month ago and was relativley pleased at the ease and convenience of it. I no longer had to make a pot (or 1/2 a pot) of coffee wondering if my husband was going to have any that particular morning or not. And then measuring
0, Worst coffee maker: I bought the keurig about 2 years ago and without fail the company has had to send me a new one every 6 months. The brewer works great for about 1 to 2 months and then goes down hill from there. Read all the reviews
0, It's not working well.: We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
0, NOT worth it - tons of problems: I am so upset about my coffee maker. I received it for a gift in 12/09 and for the last six months
0, Platinum series is terrible: Bought a platinum series brewer. Wish I had never done so. Have to keep constantly unplugging and restarting to get it to work correctly. Piece of junk
1, Christmas Present: I bought this coffee pot for my daughter as a christmas/birthday present. She wanted it because they had one at work and loved it. She said the one I got her was even nicer then the one at work.
0, Unreliable and Unpredicatable.: This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee
0, What's the point? Long term revenue.: I recently experienced one of these appliances at my office where I was really impressed. Although we had to purchase our own K-Cups they ended up being relatively inexpensive ($.44/Kup) for the price of convenience. And so
1, Keurig B70 Coffee System: I am so happy with my Keurig B70 Platinum Coffee system. I am mostly impressed with the easiness of it's use
1, Wonderful: Very happy with this purchase. Easy enough to set up. I really like being able to set the beverage temperature. I like the highest setting at 192-degrees for my beverages
0, Yes it's short-cupping: Well
1, Keurig B70: I am very pleased with my Keurig B70. It easy and fast to use. I love the different varieties of coffee and tea offered. I now can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea anytime during the day without the hassles of a conventional coffee maker and so I do. I do miss it when out of town. I am considering getting one for my small office staff so they and I can enjoy it at work.
1, Wait for Product: Had to wait 6 weeks from Amazon for this brewer. Then the order was finally cancelled so I bought it from JR and got it in three days.
0, returned: I returned it. It was broken when I received it. I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff. I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything. I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.
1, brewer is very stylish: Let me say this brewer is very stylish
0, I CANT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I must say that I absolutely hated this story. I describe this book with three words and these words are...pointless and confusing. Trick of the Eye is extremely slow for the first 80 pages and then after that the story gets so mixed up and confusing that you can't understand it. This book was so confusing I don't even know what the story is really about. And as and ending note
1, What a cool album...: Mark Isham has a gift for capturing
1, Plano Four Handgun Case: All I can say is WOW! These are some pretty big hangun cases! For the price
1, Good value: might not stand the test of time
1, Great storage case: I actually didn't get this for pistols. It works great to store our electronic depth sounder and fish finder with all its cables and attachments.
1, A book for all ages: I'm 12 but I really like this picture book. I learned a lot about what Henry Thoreau was trying to do when he built a cabin by Walden Pond
1, Wedding Goddess is divine: Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful
1," Scary for Grown Ups!: Before ""Leaving Las Vegas"" Mike Figgis directed this rather nasty adult thriller which features Kim Novak's most recent film appearance to date. She's brilliant in this small part as a dying woman reunited with the son she gave up for adoption. As she slips into morphine induced dementia"
0," For Collectors Only?: This is far from being the best NRBQ album available. As the ""best bar band in the world"""
1, A Different Sequel to American Graffiti.: Most of the Original Cast are back
0, No where near the Original: If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So
0, Not as Good as the Original!!!: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!
1, All The Great Oldies!: Wow
0, A clear look at Islam: A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
0, Horrible reception: I had this hooked up with digital cable. I tried going through the regular cable line and S-video. Going through the regular cable line resulted in an awfully grainy screen. Going through S-video didn't make it any less grainy
1, Amazing Immune booster: Cats Claw is such an effective immunobooster that the AMA has listed it as a drug to avoid in the case of organ transplant. I'm sold.
1, jumpstarter: Fantastic product! Good value. We can say nothing negative about it. We carry it with us on trips. Family members borrow it. Wow - what more can be said.
1, Works well so far
0, Xantrex 852-2000 XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Battery: I was disapointed. I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer
0, Worst product I have ever purchased: My Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600 Heavy Duty is not good for an emergency. It is an emergency. The unit does not hold a charge. It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by 10% each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask
1, Keep one in your trunk: I purchased this product to use primarily in case my battery died
1, Really great
0, Readout Never Worked ;-(: I've had this product for about a year. The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product
0, Somebody Help: I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD. I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger. They cannot send me a replacement because they do not have one. They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger. They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund. I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost. I bought this in August and have not received a refund
0, THEY TRY BUT THEY CAN'T: They try hard
0, A Real Snoozer: Hard to believe that someone could take one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century and make it this mind-numbingly boring. Written with an overly verbose
0, Ten Days That Shook the World: I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
0, Giant Disappointment: Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects
1, DreamCatcher!: Jonesy
1, Satisfying King: As Stephen King gets older
0, SK's worst ever
0, Tried to like it...: As a huge fan of early Stephen King works
0," Not His Best: Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but ""Dreamcatcher"" joins his other two bombs"
1, One of Stephen King's best novels.: Definately one of the best books I've read in awhile. Even though the book is long the story grips you and you can't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
0, Gak. . .: I've been reading S.K. since 1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really
0, Makes Tommyknockers look like genius: I never thought I would say this
1, Audio CDs are Copy Protected: I thought the story was great. Jeffrey DeMunn does an excellent job reading and acting it. Be advised though - you will not be able to listen to these 20 CDs on your computer nor will you be able to rip them down to a single MP3 CD.
1, Very Good: While I would not say this is the be all end all Stephen King book
0, His 15 MINUTES ARE UP.: I was a die-hard SK fan until about 4 books ago. He's lost his touch. I so wanted to like this book
0, Not as good as most of his books: I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one
1, Riveting! Reads like a true crime thriller!: Fast paced book. Though I have no connection to finance
1, it is very good: i like this dvd
1, Perfect for a Companion Piece to a Young Man's Wallet: I purchased this for my grandson as a companion piece to his wallet. He makes sure he carries this everywhere along with his wallet. It prevents carrying a lot of loose change and it's very appropriate for a boy to carry since there is nothing 'girlie' about it. My dad always carried a change pouch too since he couldn't stand loose change jingling around in his pocket
0, Squeeze coin Pouch: Nice leather. The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it. Overall not a well designed product.
1, How Fi Dance!!: Whoa!! This DVD is tight work
0, Good recording of a forgettable concerto: This would be a reasonable purchase for one with intense desire to complete a Yo-Yo Ma or John Williams collection. However Williams' cello concerto presents many problems for the listener
0, shafi: I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.
1, This is a must for all du Maurier fans!: If you enjoyed her classic
1, Just what I needed.: This was high on my Wife's Christmas list and it was reasonably priced
1, the gift: my favorite Christmas music
1, Gödel's Proof: The copy I read is the edition of Nagel and Newman's 1958 book revised in 2001 by Douglas Hofstadter
0, defective product: I have used other Yves St
1, three powers: the power of three is a very good book the amazing combinations of life and fantasy are exsqisit and although i am not all the way through i am already searching for another
0, Side Effects: In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However
0, Can't hold a candle to Billy Blanks: Don't waste your money on this one. I wish I could get my money back. Poor taping quality
1, Rush Revealed: I have been a Rush fan since I was in Jr. High back in the mid 80's. As I became older
1, Rush fans will love it: Both DVD's are great. Make sure you watch both. I understand the band personalities much more now. It covers from the very first high school gig thru and after Peart's family loss and the band reuniting.If you like RUSH
1, The Greatest Band in the Galaxy!: Having been a fan of Rush for nearly thirty years
1, Must see rock film: Not one for hyperbole
1, Awesome!: What a great DVD for Rush fans. The early videos are great. The number of musicians that have been influenced by Rush is huge. They truely are a unique band--love them or hate them. One of the best things in the video is the dinner at the hunting lodge. I couldn't stop laughing! Those scenes are worth the price right there. Alex has a tremendous sense of humor. I think the most important thing these guys have is a true friendship for each other and they don't take themselves overly seriously. Really
1, Rush Fans Grab this You will LOVE it: If you are a true Rush fan you will really Love this
1, Great video: Tremendous career retrospective from a band like no other. Very
1," obviously talented: This is a good disk. In fact very good. However it's a bit frustrating because there are flashes of absolute and utter brilliance....Then there are parts that are a bit forgettable.In a just world ""couldn't you tell"" would be a top 10 hit on the radio. ""Emily's dead to me"" is quite delicate and beautiful. ""Hide"
1," Clearly one of the best debuts of 05': BC Camplight didn't make a perfect record but his debut ""hide"
0," Not as advertised: My son is very disappointed because the illustrations on the ""Look Inside"" feature are nowhere to be found. It is possible that this may be the best story ever written but please deliver what is advertised. Have a fabulous day.I called Amazon and some lady with a thick foreign accent answered. She was very nice and had a good handle on the language. She assured me that she would send a copy that matched the description on the website. Unfortunately I received the same book. There are no illustrations in this book. This is a bad experience with this book but I still love Amazon."
0, Not the best telling: I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently
1," The ""Citizen Kane"" of Canadian Frat Movies: Just like my title said"
0, Terrible graphics
1, WE ALL NEED TO READ THIS ONE & PASS IT ON!: WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one
0, Not the best study guide available: I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful
1," Homework review: This is a great book by Edgar Allan Poe that is filled with great ""Poe""ms. My favorite is the poem called ""The Raven."" Some of the poems are a bit scary"
1, very good.....: if u dnt read at least one work of edgar allen poe by the time ur 30
1, An abbreviated collection of Como's Christmas songs: This CD has only 10 of Perry Como's songs on it. If you like Perry Como
0, Not as I remember: I used to watch the Perry Como show as a kid and thought he was cool back then. This CD was a bit disappointing - I thought the music was listless and didn't have quite the Christmas spirit/enthusiasm as I had hoped.
1," ""The Mummy"" by Marion: I was a big fan of the orginal ""Mummy"" and was anxious to see the remake. The first time I did I laughed! I thought it was so stupid I'd never care to see it again BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. The next day I wanted to see it again"
1, An excellent must-see: In this powerfully wonderful action film
1," Not ""Great"" but a ""Good"" one!: All right - I admit"
1, The Mummy: The first time I saw this movie I thought it was not going to be good. Like who wants to see a mummy chase people. But till I saw the whole move it was great. It was filled with action pack adventure and laughter. The Mummy was about a group of people searching for a long-lost treasure but unearthed a 3
0, Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.: After viewing for about 10 minutes
0, no no no no NO!!: This movie sucks big time
0, The special fx were sub-par and that was the best part!: Avoid this film at all costs! The special effects
1, A vastly amusing movie: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the 1932 film it claims to be a remake of
0, super predictable rubbish: The original is much better
0, Belongs on MST3K: This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Very few films manage to get everything wrong
1, Great Special Effects With Humor Throughout: I thought that this movie was great. I love Brendan Frasier's acting ability and I can always expect to laugh when I am watching a film he is in. I felt that the story line could have moved a little faster at the beginning with a little less violence but all and all a fun movie to watch.
0, I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a horror: Visual effects aside
1, Rachel Wiesz is incredible!: I loved this movie
1, This film is not bad!: Well
1, A Thoroughly Satisfying Adventure Movie: The Mummy is high quality entertainment. It does a great job of entertaining
1," Hahahahahahahahahaha: I loved this movie and this keyboard I'm typing on is kind of whacky so any mistakes are probably not my fault.Back to the movie: it was a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser kept me laughing. The characters were pretty well drawn. And all the expendables were somehow still endearing. John Hannah was standout. Very funny guy. ""Bad luck"
1, better than the 1932 classic: the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the 1990's. the mummy packs a wallop!
1, Mummy...the ultimate movie!: I really loved this movie
0, Another worthless Remake: Hollywood must think that fans of Horrormovies are Braindead
0, very disappointing: Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries
0, Not worth the cost.: Bought 2 shirts $29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $20 per shirt
0, Huge disappointment: I've played all of the CSI games and the three L&O games prior to this one and
0, Poor quality: After first time worn it turned color. It is too thick and cumbersome to wear as a toe ring. Very poor deign.
0, cheap n nasty: gold colour came off within 3 days
0, THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS
0, Pretty sure they are not authentic!: I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit. The razors are not shaving smoothly
1, Great!: This item came to me in a timely manner and there was absolutely nothing wrong with this product.
1, La mejor afeitadora del momento: Yo llevo casi 2 años afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces
0, This review is for the R-Rated version: Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay
0, Bordering on incoherent: As a grdauate student
1, Infant Fun: My son is 14 weeks old. He started playing with this toy at about 13 weeks. So far he is in heaven with this toy. When I lay him on the floor to play he loves to bat at the toy to activate it. He loves the lights
1, great toy: my son loved it when he was little
0, too many negatives: I just got this toy for my six month old daughter and I cannot recommend it. Here is why:The batteries don't last at all (empty after ten days)It is way too heavy
0, Don't Know Yet: My daughter is 6 1/2 months old. She's been sitting up for at least 2 weeks. She laughs at this toy when I activate the music. She picks up the balls if I hand them to her. Otherwise
1, Fantastic addition for any road warrior: I run my own insurance business and was always inundated by a sea of paperwork. This little scanner fits into my BJC-85 printer and serves double duty - I can scan and then print with the same machine. Genius! I would have liked the ability to scan documents into a pdf format
0, I have had more fun with a bag of sharp glass.: The creators of this game wasted great graphics on a game with not enough depth. The only time I had fun playing this is when I paused it and took a nap and had a dream about Pamela Anderson. There weren't any guns and the game was way to hard.
1, Worth it: My daughter got this toy last Christmas when she was 2. She liked it
1, Best toy I ever purchased: Kasey the Kinderbot is truly the best toy I ever purchased! I have a 3 year old girl and an 8 year old boy and both love it. It really does make learning fun for both of them. Both have used it constantly. Luckily
1, My 3 year old LOVES his KASEY!!!!: And so do I. It has a volume control on it to boot!This is the PERFECT educational toy to hold my little mans attention while I get some housework done. He EVEN knows how to change the learning functions on the back. He LOVES IT and will probably love it for a long time more....when he outgrows it
0, But is it accurate?: Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4
1, Lovely Ring: I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so
0, Much Too Expensive: I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges
0, Getting burned: I tried this but it was not working out for me
1, Great price
1, Razors: Fast and good service. I really appreciate your efforts. Too bad we have to use so many words to put in our review!
0, These are not real Gillette blades!: These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off
0, Seems like knock-offs: not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade... these will give you cuts and burn.. will not buy again
0, Doing bad business: The product did not show up on time. I tried to email the seller but they never got back to me. I still have no idea if they are going to give me the product. It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere.
1, Great for everyday shaving needs: I am quite picky about my razor blades
0, Knock-offs!: These are knock-offs. They HURT! The blades aren't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges.
1, Great deal: These are the same razors you purchase at the store- but for a third less. Even beats costco's pricing. Great deal
0, Knockoff: Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive
1, high society: This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years
0, OK but not great: It's a fairly readable book
0, Technical book purchase review.: High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR
1, What Makes The Perfect Balaclava?: What makes the perfect balaclava?Ideally it should be elastic
0, Unfortunately
0, as ugly as it gets: UFC 43 is a joke of an event. There is only one good fight which is the main event. The rest of the card is saved for no namers or fat has-beens such as Kimo and Tank. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly
1, Great for Pilates Classes: I just bought this and used it in my Pilates class for the first time today. My students loved it and I loved it too. It is even great for easy listening while cleaning your house or enjoying a nice afternoon relaxation.
1, My favorite Metheny CD: I listened to this cassette quite a bit back in 1985 and then left it for quite a while. Last year (2003)
1, Better than first impression!: The MonsterGecko FPS mouse it much better than it looks. Trust me. Even I looked at it at first and thought it was a waste of time. But when I saw it for a great black Friday deal
0, Pass: Novelty item
0, Pointless: If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.
1, VERY GOOD!: I bought this item from davewemall recently and it came very quickly. They provided good service and when I got the item
0, Pretty but flimsy: This is a very attractive feeder
0, Nice looking
1, Value Feeder: Overall a very good item. Holds plenty of seed
1, Topeak Exployer Bike Rack with Spring: It was beyond my expectations. Its a sturdy well constructed rack.The spring on the rack works great! Combine withn the bike bag I purchased its all I need for my cycling experience.
1, Great rack for bigger bikes: After ordering two racks that would not mount properly
1, Functional tent: Hey
0, UV rating?: Contrary to the Amazon description
1, Great play tent fits in very small bag: I bought this tent to take to the beach for my 8 month old. The bag it comes in is so small that I thought
0, Boring
0, heinous: This is the most terrible
0, Horrendous: Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot. I was not one of the other losers I have what they called taste in movies in this day and age and this is just flat out retarted. Its also a shame i have to give this movie 1 star it makes me feel as though i support this shi* in a way. I just wonder if the acting in it could be half as bad as the movie or the plotI wouldnt watch this if i was paid
1, Wonderful read aloud book!: I read this book to my 11 year old son. Both of us were captivated with Roald Dahl's experiences prior to and during World War II.Though our family has thoroughly enjoyed all of Dahl's fiction
0," Dead or didn't work: I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it... and it completely failed to work! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards (which I was using) and this PS. Supposedly I had a ""fixed"" unit though"
0, Not a good fit: The tent seems to be good. But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent. Just comes off too easily when the kids try to crawl through it. Would find a better tent tunnel combination that holds up strong.
0, too narrow: I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times. Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow! What happened?
1, Best I've Used: I was pleasantly surprised. This is really the best razor I have ever used. I just assumed that having 4 blades was just another gimmick
1, Good value for a great product: My older black retreiver has flaky and peeling skin. She had a thyroid condition and we use this shampoo. It really soothes and seems to help.
1, Jewelry clean solution: Use in my ultrasonic unit and makes everything look brand new. I recommend you heat solution in microwave before adding to unit to boost cleaning power on grease/lotion which sticks to prongs.
1, Great read: Overall
0, Usual Glacial Paced Novel from James: This is so typical of H. James writing...very
0, I love classics. I'll never read Henry James again.: It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting
0, not durable: Several of these came with my crossbow so I used them to sight in and bought Gold Tip brand bolts for hunting. They're a bit brittle/ fragile as compared to the Gold Tip bolts. They were destroyed by target shooting
0, warning about motorola phones: The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone
1, Amazing product: This is a cool product
1, In agreement with others: I would have to echo the sentiments of many of the other reviews. I bought this when my 11 month old son started pushing everything he could around the living room. He loves it but it is way too fast for his little legs. Also
0, It sucks!: My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together
1, My 3 year old still plays with this: My 3 year old loves this toy. It's now an outside toy
0, Not Safe: I've never written a review on an item
0," Horrible toy...: My daughter received this toy when she was about 11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the ""v"" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy."
0, Not Useful as a Walker for all Children: My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
1, cute and durable: this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.
1, Gamma Good: Gamma's high rise gold 75 is the best ball hopper I've ever owned. I've been playing tennis for over 20 years. Gamma good!
1, Funny Horror!: Another one of those humorous horror movies that you liked as a kid. It's Creature Feature on a sleigh ride. Fun.
1, Fun!!: I bought this tunnel for my daughter for her first birthday
1, great toy: I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel
1," Excellent Lens!: I don't have much to say that hasn't been said before. This is the sharpest lens I own and it has become my ""gold standard"". The image quality of all of my other lenses get compared to this one.This is also the first lens that I have owned which has exceeded the capabilities of my camera. As I zoom in"
0," Disappointing: I think had this book been labelled ""romantic erotica"" instead of romance"
1, Rutger Hauer Exemplified: Loved it
0, AWFUL: Just horrible. Good looking guys but that does not make make up for the long periods of boredom.One of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
1, Present for a friend: A friend of mine is a cake decorator and is always looking for new styles and ways to make her creations. I bought this for her birthday and she loved it. She was excited to get a book from Debbie Brown
0, doncha think: that this song is better promoted for itself rather than on the strength of PR trickery trying to capitalize on all things web-based?it's a cynical marketing world that tries to sell us its corporate soap wrapped up with a hippy or a punk bow
0, DO NOT BUY IF IT'S SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON.COM: Amazon sent me a BOOTLEG copy of this album. There was a SCANNED picture as an insert and the cd was a CD-R. There was no back to this case at all.!! They are selling it for full retail price
0, Nice thought but too weak: in the age of the overblown Rod Stewart&Clay Aikens trying to Romance a Era gone by with very Sub-Par Results add another victim to the list.Mandy Moore.now Mandy Moore Vocally is closer to Jessica Simpson
0, Could have been........: With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy
0, Not great: I agree with an earlier review in that the first three songs are not good and they sound the same. The rest is okay but not great. She definitely has a very good voice and could probably come out with an amazing cd someday
0, Disappointing....: I've been a fan of Mandy Moore from the beginning
1, Yey!: Ummmm You don't have to be an adult to like these songs. In fact that was what I was afraid of when many posted the clips of her new songs on her website. They sounded old... But listening to the whole song is a different story
0, Sub Zero's worst role ever (LOGO) SMK: How could Ed Boon do this to my favorite MK character Sub Zero. What a discrace to the MK series.Sucky graphics
1, Gets the job done.: This drying rack gets the job done. Sometimes the plastic pieces at the end of the legs come off
0, tough to read: The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book.
0, tedious run-on sentences; shallow characters: I'm sure Saramago's Nobel Prize was not based on this work. Not one person in my book group was able to finish this book because of the tedious
1, Great: Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.
0, Not Compatible with windows 7: I gave one star because i could not play game.Im glad i only paid $6.95.Thair is a way to get the game to play on windows 7
1, You go boy!: I know it's mostly just covers
0, Hated It!!!!: I can't believe how bad this sounds. There are a lot better singers that are just starting out. I wouldn't recommend this cd!
1, Baby loves it
0, Too Loud: I recently had to replace my Peaceful Planet Aquarium with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. I am not pleased with the Ocean Wonders
0, Not my son's favorite: My friends recommended this product
0, WILL NEVER PURCHASE USED AGAIN: I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one
1, Works wonders when putting your child to sleep!: The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far
0, boring and stupid
1, Won't Travel Without It: Our son is 8 months old and we've been using the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in his crib since he was about 2 or 3 months old. He has grown to expect the same song every time he goes in for a nap or to bed for the night. There are three settings on it
1, The best bedtime toy: We first learned about this toy when our baby was in the hospital. We attached it to his crib and he loved it. He loved it so much that we went and got one for him. Whenever he is upset we just have to turn it on and he calms right down. It has different settings so they either have something to see
1, Don't go home from the hospital without it!: This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.
0, has no water after being in the closet for 2 years.: My 3 year old son played with this all the time till he got to be a year old then i put it in the closet for a while till i had my 2nd son and just toke it out and now it has no water inside and the fish dont move either. Is there some where i can take it to get a replacement?
1, Perfect for Bed Time!!!: The best thing about this crib toy is the volume control. My 3-month old is content to lay there by herself just looking at the lights (only at night time though). Great for when she is semi-sleepy
1, This makes your bedtime routine easy!: I have used this aquarium in my daughter's crib since she was two months old. She is now 10 months and still loves it! More importantly
1, Great Entertainment: We bought this for my 2 month old daughter because she loves my parents fish tank. At first she wasn't all that intested in it
0, who picked the music...???: we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son
1, The music stops too soon!!!: I cannot compare it to anything else since we bought it for our first child. She LOVES to watch the fish move and she tries to grab things. I put her in her crib when I am folding her clothes etc. The problem is that I am constantly running back and forth to turn the music back on!!! It ends too soon and that is what she loves! Other than that
1," Put baby to sleep fast: I got this when my son was four months old and he is now 14 months old and still uses it to go sleep. He loves to ""talk"" to the fish and every night. He loves to push the buttons all the time to make it go. When he was younger the music on this was the only thing that calmed him down. It is very durable as my two year has unhook it and it fell on the floor and it still works fine. I would recommend this to everyone"
1, My daughter has loved it since she was a newborn: I recieved this at my baby shower. My daughter has loved it since the day I brought her home from the hospital. She listens to it every night when she goes to bed. She would always smile when i would turn it on when she was just a few weeks old
0, 5 minutes??: I bought this item thinking that it would be a wonderful thing to have in my son's crib to help him fall asleep. It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.
1, get TWO!: This was the BEST thing we got for a baby shower gift. The motor gave out after being played over and Over and OVER and **OVER** again every night for 5 years. He wanted a replacement one but we finally convinced him it was for babies and he was too grown up for it. As another reviewer said
1, What would we do without it??!!: This is the greatest thing!! We use it every night to put our 12 week old daughter to bed after her lullaby. She goes into her crib wide awake but this is so calming and soothing to her that 9 times out of 10 she falls asleep within 5 minutes. The variety of settings is great too - we use the bubbles (and lights and music) if she's really awake and the lights and music only if she's already a bit sleepy. It is truly wonderful! We traveled with it as well and it really held up
0, An awful textbook!: This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book.
0, Waste of money: This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money.
1, GREAT REFERENCE BOOK! GLAD I HAD IT!: I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy 1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her 1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book.
1, Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal: I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
0, Feels disconnected: Although my kids (5
0, Avoid buying this product!: I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them. What a fool I was. This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio. Avoid buying this product. I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me. DO NOT buy this product (Sennheiser R40).
0, Esta versión está recortada: La novela es genial
1, Wonderful read: I started this book because my son is a rower and I'd hoped to learn a bit more about the techniques and the mindset of rowers. Sara Hall provides that
1, Incredible: One of the best games ever to play against your friends. A top five game as far as the n64 was concerned. Its a game hat changes the football rules slightly while still holding the integrity of what the sport is. Just incredible as far as the fun factor goes. Definately a game that makes pulling the n64 out of the closet. Five stars all the way!
1," First-rate film: Not being an ""action"" movie buff"
0, not easy set-up: The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However
1, A Real Hit with Our 18-month old Grandson: I got this for our 18-month old grandson for Christmas and this was just the thing for him to satisfy his craving to climb in
0, Not impressed: I was disappointed in the tent part of this set. It's flimsy
0, so so good: Works most of the time
0, not received yet: article not received yet
1, Easy
1, Loose Weight the Healthy way: I lost almost 20 pounds just by taking herbalife nothing really worked for me
0, Hmm...: Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits
0, FAKE PRODUCT!!!!: This is not a real product from Herbalife
1, VERY GOOD: It was more than an anime
0, Clueless!!: This movie will leave you staring dumbfounded at your screen in disbelief - that you actually sat through 88 minutes of this appalling excuse for entertainment. The characters were as superficial as the plot was non-existent. A couple of cuss words and Sienna Guillory's breasts were thrown in to give it an R rating but truthfully the DVD box should have carried a government health warning. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even waste the time or money renting it. Alicia Silverstone and Joe Anderson fail to explore their relationship in any dimension whatsoever
0, a beautiful set
1, great cd
0, A Very Difficult Book from which to Learn HTML: I have now struggled with this book for many hours
1, Excellent Content: While this book was written by a number of authors all seemed to have made it easy for me to understand what they were writing. Hey
0, Travel Converter: The Converter appears to be fine
1, Brilliant collection.: This double disc anthology does a wonderful job of spanning Be Bop Deluxe's collected works. The strongest cuts
0, The Ashen Thief: I got dissapointed with this book. the ashen knight was a very good book centered in the knighthood
0," I can make it better!: I recently purchased a DD50 from ebay - and it was about what I expected. Yamaha make generally good trusty products - but this kit has the same basic flaw as all electronic druma I have tried - that is - the pads do not pick up light strokes - and also don't respond to heavy hits. In other words they don't react anything like real drums.Ok this is a very cheap unit so you get what you pay for right? - well actually - I did design and market electronic drums (analogue type) back in the eighties - and I spent a long time working on this ""response"" thing - eventually getting very impressive results.So when I got the DD50 recently I immediately set about improving things - and I have devised a fairly simple way of improving the response drastically with a bit of add-on circuitry.If you are interested please email me. mickwest1@hotmail.com"
1, Ella sings: I think this is a very good album
0, Had meant to get a 3 USB cord: When I got the procut
1, Excellent: This product is an amazing price for the quality it produces. As well as an incredible saving price which is extremely low for such a cable. Great delivery
1, A solid anime title: This anime is a very nice one that is pretty good for its time. The characters are easy to adapt to and some of the moments are very hilarious. The only thing I didnt really aprove of were the tanks. With a name like Tank Police
1, the best album ive heard in a while: excellent combination of electronic
0," Disapointing: The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10"
1, All Things Ocean: Great story
1, Awsome....but....: This is definaately one of the best DVD's around. The options are incredible and both versions are awsome. The only problem I had with the DVD is the fact that it seems like the sound transfer was unbalanced. the dialoug seemed too quiet at parts and i had to constantly lower and raise the levels. otherwise
0, Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED: This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first and only version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
0," ""The Abyss"" Single Disc Edition--Misleading Advertising !!!: Just want to make you all aware that the single disc edition for the DVD THE ABYSS has misleading sound options.The back of the disc jacket states that English 5.1 sound is available.When you engage the menus only English or French surround sound are available.I blew my stack when I noticed this and now I am stuck with an inferior product."
0," The first song is truncated: ""Opinion # 33"" is really a 5 minute 5 second long song. The 3:24 song that Amazon has is truncated. Amazon should fix this."
1, Angels on my Kindle - Amazon experience: Our pastor was doing a series of sermons based on this book. We were not required to purchase the book. I am so glad I did. The book contained more information about angels than I had ever expected. The content was based on Holy Scripture (The Bible) and cited references. Reading this book inspired me to read more books on angels. This was the first book I had read written by Billy Graham. I had no idea what a great author he was. I have since ordered other books by Billy Graham and am pleased with them all.
1, Excellent Book: Billy Graham really brings home the reality of angels in this book and how they are not some imaginary beings
0, Power Jacked: I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006. I bought a laptopp on the cheap end

0, booooo!: wow this has got to be the worst game i have ever played. I mean really who wants to go around and deliver papers for a video game when they could be on quests to save the world. instead of quests to get a good tip.
1, You're missing alot by overlooking this album!: Let's put it this way
0, Radio ratios: 2 1/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai
0, This book is garbage!: Do not waste your money ! Instead of bying this junk
0, WA I & II for dummies written by dummies!: I have to agree with the past couple of recent postings! THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS! Trump one up for Bill and his gang at Redmond for taking our money and laughing all the way to the bank. Save your money and look elsewhere!
0, Should be titled 'A Brief Intro to MS Windows': Good news: the book has great style
0, Good overview maybe
0, Begginer content written for an expert: This has begginer level content
1, The holy one is dethroned: God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality
0, Boring in the extreme: I have persisted for far too long with this dreary
0, Huge Disappointment!: Don't remember when I've been so let down
1, As classics go
0," Contrive Hard!: An action-filled yet unsatisfying sequel to the 1988 classic. Bruce Willis' engaging performance as the intrepid John McClane is weighed down by a contrived screenplay and lack of memorable villains. Filmmaker Renny Harlin would fare better in the stunt-filled Sylvester Stallone romp ""Cliffhanger."" Avoid ""Die Hard 2"" and proceed directly to ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) - a superior follow-up that reunited Willis with original director John McTiernan."
1, Intriguing
0, didn't like it.: I thought this book was slow and boring. The characters wre not well developed and I didn't like the author's writing style. The book was amateurishly written. I do not recommend this book.
1," Such an exciting and interesting book!: I recently finished reading "" Casting The First Stone"". This book was simply amazing. This was my first time reading a book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I have seen her name around"
1, I couldn't put it down to save my life!: Kim Roby has done it! this book is such a gripping look into one woman's pain filled struggle with her husband that just happens to be a man of the cloth. Man of the Flesh would have been more apporpriate. Tanya Black is an strong
0, Really?!? I have to have a PH-D and rank in the 90th Percentile in the GRE to learn and run A MVT test?: Honestly QualPro
0, This Electric Youth Needs a Jolt: The art is the reason to purchase this
1, This is so kool: This is really great. There are 2 analog sticks and this thing vibrates!! That so kool. If you you don't want it to vibrate
0, Disappointed: I was really disappointed in this purchase. The music was not what I expected. It is not a good choice for a Yoga class. More disappointing is that I can't return it.
0, Dull attempt to ape Hitchcock's style: Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh
0, Buy the DVD for Branagh's Commentary: I thought the film was way over the top on mood and effects. It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot. I think it could have been much easier to watch if it had been filmed with 1/2 the intensity. But the cast is wonderful and Branagh's commentary on the DVD gives great information about film making
0, Boring....: Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
1, Their Best: The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s

1, Great movie about the disaster at Pearl Harbor: I have this movie on VHS and wanted a copy on DVD. This is a great movie.
1, The version: I Really like war movies and this is the definitive version of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The effects are great and the historical background are precise. It's superior to the recent Pearl Harbor film. This is the movie!
1, TORA! TORA! TORA! WINNWR WINNER! WINNER!: Great quality
0, Buyer Beware: When I first purchased this vacuum I was very impressed with the ability it had to suck up pet hair. I have a cat and a dog and it seemed to work wonderfully at getting the hair out of the carpets. However
1, So far it's great: I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out
1, A fantastic vacuum for the price!: I bought this vacuum four months ago and it works great! Easy to use and really seems very powerful. Picks up things from your carpet that you didn't even see. The push-button release for the dirt container makes it very simple to empty. This is an excellent vacuum for the price. I use about a mid-range height setting for my carpets and it works great.
1, Extremely pleased!: I was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment
0, Stopped Working: I wonder if the same people who gave this vacumn high ratings would give the same rating after six months. Mine worked well for about six months and stopped working this past weekend. I had it cleaned out thoroughly and replaced the belt
0, worked once: i bought this 5 months ago -- it worked just fine out of the box ... the 2nd time i used it
0, Updated Feedback: I have updated my feedback for this product because the container cap fall off while I was removing the dust from the container. The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken (opened it only a few times). Although I was able to close the container now
0, Defective unit features: After about 2-3 months
1, economical and efficient: I thought at first that the vacuum was extremely hard to push until I realized that the lowest setting was for smooth floors rather than carpet. Once I adjusted the dial
0, Junk: Wife bought this vacuum about a year ago. It has sucked since day 1. Hate it. Piece of junk. Smells like burning rubber
1, Hoover U55607-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright: This vacuum works great. It works so much better then expensive ones that I bought.The suction is awesome. It's not to heavy. Would recomend it to anyone who has athritis
0, Absolute Junk: This vacuum is compete junk. After owning it less than it for a month my wife and I had it into the Hoover service center 4 times. The store technician said
0, A Headache of a Vacuum: The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years
1, good product: I've used this hoover for one month and it works pretty well. Easy to use and all the parts work fine. The filters are effective. A little bit stiff and heavy
0, Broke after one year: I know that companies design (very cleverly) products to go bad after a certain amount of time
1, fuzzfree: I have newer carpet in my military housing home. And since it isn't the best of carpets we get alot of fuzz from it
1, Fantastic Vacuum - Hoover: We brought this because of the reviews we read and they were right
0, Wish I'd Read Reviews Before Buying: Purchased this vacuum just after Christmas
0, Poor Quality construction: I purchased this for my 7 year old. He is really in to hot Wheels. He is pretty good about being careful with his toys but with an hour of opening this new toy he was taping the doors back on. This product is very low quality. The wheels have fallen off the cars. I would avoid buying this.

1, An Underappreciated Capra Classic: I love this movie. All of Frank Capra's films are great
1, WARREN AND MAY ARE GREAT!!!!!: I love this film
0, Broken!: We bought this as a birthday gift and when it was opened - it was broken inside the box. I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed! And
0, A broken item was sent: I received a broken item from the seller. This is the first time I received an undesirable product from Amazon and I will think twice to order something in future.I needed that item for a special occation and somehow managed to glue the pieces.

1, Awesome game: If you like action and great moves

0, Comments on Crowd Madness: Was disappointed that so much of the original book was left out in order to focus on investor psychology. MacKay was a master of crowd psychology in its many forms
1, Informative and interesting - Maybe not for a beginner: I really enjoyed this book. Written in the 1950s
1, A great second volume: As of always Norman Geisler pumps out another book 
0," Curious about this book!: I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia. I think it does a bit of a disservice to people with serious mental illness who have to take or often refuse medication with difficult side effects to advocate an experimental and risky ""cure"" with no significant treatment outcomes but it's a definite read."
1," Travel Prep for Italy.: I checked this out to get more background before a trip to Italy. I am going to recommend it for a young (middle school) friend in anticipation of future travel.I appreciate things more if I know why it is so special. I can imagine this age group could be pretty bored if they don't ""get"" why this stuff is so special & they'd rather be home with their video games. Donatello is more than a turtle with attitude."
0, Komplete Mess: This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful
0, What planet am I on?: What planet am I on.....isn't this earth? I have to check because I recently saw a terribly boring and vastly overrated movie called Dreamgirls. You would think from all the hype this movie got it would have been the best musical since the Wizard Of Oz! Instead what I saw was another example of a bunch of snob critics trying to sell me a chocolate covered lemon. I won't criticise each aspect because there isn't anymore time left to spend on this waste of a good two hours of time. Jennifer Hudson.....an Oscar.....for this.....FOGGEDDABBOUDDIT. And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets. This is worse!
0, Not at all what I expected: No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson
0, It does have a story
0, Ouch: So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical
0, Boring: This movie is totally boring. There is no plot. I am glad I just rented it from the local library.
0, NightmareGirls: At about the 90 minute mark
1," ""Dreamsgirls ""- A Dream Movie!: ""Dreamgirls"" is an absolutely outstanding adaptation of the stage production. Jennifer Hudson absolutely shines. This is the first movie I have seen in many"
1," Best dvd edition ever: This edition is worth the price. A 3rd disc which is a Target Exclusive features: ""One Night Only"" dance remix video (4 mins.) I luv the remix video. It's Faboulus!!!!"
0, Totally blah: This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first.
0, First greek zombie flick ever...: Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.Anyways
1, Like a drug you take by listening: This music is incredibly relaxing. I have never listened to anything that helps me chill and think like this cd does. It leveled my thinking to a pace where I wasn't slow
0, Nice retrospective... but not too informative: Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders
0, Not For Those Who Wish To Build Boats: The book is filled with stories about boats
1, good purchase: Thank you very much! I Recommend mixing this with apple juice
1, Actually Awesome: For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being
0, Excess Sweetness and Filler: What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not
1, Awesome piano trio jazz: On this disc Kenny teams up with two other heavyweights
1, Never Cry Wolf: Amazing True Story of Life Among Artic Wolves: You'll laugh and you'll cry at the early adventures of this real life naturalist. Farley Mowat's writing is a joy to read
1, Wolf Behavior: Interesting and Entertaining: This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves
1, Which version to get?: Well
1, Hypnotic: A quiet
0, What was i thinking?: I bought this game because it seemed like a pretty cool product. I was wrong! This game is not thrilling and it just doesn't seem to have a point. What were they thinking when they made this game? I sold mine because it was just useless to me. I didn't get very much but anything was better than keeping it around.
1, Lyrical prose. Masterfully told.: The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier
1, Just what I expected: Everything about the purchase was good and the meter is just what I expected. I have had cheap meters before and am thrilled with the upgrade.
0, Great visual
0," A Lite Alternative: Songs like ""Follow My Way"""
1, I wanted a LITTLE more Soundgarden: I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan
0, Wow... this is one awful CD: I was hoping to be blown away by Mr. Cornell's cannon of a voice
0, best of his solo efforts and that's not saying much: This is the best Cornell solo effort and thats not saying a lot. Try out his AudioSlave or Soundgarden stuff it's amazing but this is bland and soulless like his Scream album.
0, How can anyone take this seriously?: Lyrically
1, Cornell shines in Euphoria Morning: Now you see why Soundgarden really broke up. Cornells' music was going in a different direction from the band. After a long wait
1, Euphoria Morning Glory: One of the best CD's I have ever heard! Chris is so unique with his singing and compositions
1, Awesome CD: This was a great solo debut for Chris Cornell. I still cant believe that people are comparing it to Soundgarden
1, oh honey
1, Chris Evolves With Spectacular Results: I was a moderate Soundgarden fan
1, Really Good Album that doesn't rip-off Cornell's past...: This is a really good album that manages not too sound like Soundgarden. In fact
0, will not work: I have a high end sony blu-ray player
1, The Longest Day: A wonderful classic
0, gkardd: Don't waste your $ - it wasn't worth buying the blu-ray version. I should have rented the dvd first before spending the blu-ray version.
1," Water Conditioner: This product has been excellent for dosing when performing water changes. Subsequent to its use we have found that our corals ""bloom"" as full as possible and appear to be at their healthiest. Even thought we produce R/O water using a high end filter with four cartridges including resin and deionization"
1, what a voice: It's old fashioned and has the fun sweetness of something we no longer have as much......innocence.
0, Bad.: Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music
1, Interesting
1, Good Sci-Fi flick!: Although I might not go into great detail
1, Quiet Earth and Quiet Film: I liked the quietness of the film and the simple idea behind the premise of the sci-fi story. It's neat to know that Kiwis seem to have a sense of humor even if they were the last people on Earth and take things somewhat in stride. So this film is a little different and underdramatic but has a neat perspective.What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s. Strange
1, The Quiet Earth: Great movie that arrived in perfect condition and played perfectly as well. I would recommend purchasing for this seller at any time.Cheers
0, The Quiet Earth: Waking up and finding himself alone
0," Do Not Waste Your Money Like I Did.: I hated it. I watched it the day I got from Amazon (great service-no fault there) and threw it in the garbage after a lame viewing. My first clue should have been the ""winner of 8 New Zealand Academy Awards"" banner. As with most PC movies this one involves"
1, Leisurely read: I liked the book Inspector Iminishi Investigates
1," Selleck Continues as the Modern John Wayne: Tom Selleck is one of two current western actors who continue the realism of the ""old west"" western actors in the mold of John Wayne and others. Westerns in todays age are an ""acquired taste"". Selleck is a natural and in this tale he continues his best efforts as he did in the Sacketts"
1, Powerful and efficient: This product is more durable and powerful than the B&D version. It has one housing with battery with inter-changeable blades where the B&D is two seperate houseings with non-inter-changeable blades. I have had this company's grass shears before and would definitely buy this brand again.
0, powerless cutter: I purchased this grass cutter to trim a small area around my sons grave which takes about five minutes. when I first received this item it worked fine. Now after the battery is fully charged it does not last more than a minutes. I have wanted to return it because it has it has a lifetime guarantee please let me know how to get a replacement
0, poor life cycle - not a smart buy: We bought this in 4/09 and gave it VERY moderate use. We have little trimming but the product looked like a good buy. Initial use was impressive with good battery life that was always kept recharged. it was never exposed to wet conditions and never used inappropriately.We did buy an extension handle that did not work because the plastic electrical connection was misaligned. We returned that one and asked for another
0," Worth equal to toilet paper: do you want a summary of this book?Stupid kid: ""Hey Mr. Manager"
0, Not a big deal!: Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple
1, Worth more than One Minute: A little oversimplified and repetitive
1, For the real manager.: This book is for the real manager who is looking for ways to improve efficiency
1, Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!: Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.
1, Grandmas Bliss: I love all the books by Debbie Bliss. Lots of patterns and Ideas. If you love her yarn you will love the books too.
0, Cannot even compare to the book!: Terrible
1, The Shining: I'm a sucker for a wonderful love story and I love watching movies with history to it and it takes place when I was born.
1, SPY
0, Worst. Economics. Text. Ever.: This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered. This 466-page soft cover text is absolutely miserable
1, Pretty Darn Good: I normaly spend my time cringing at the writing of computer science authors. This book is fairly straight forward. It skips a beat here and there
0, Tuner Technology: Analog: This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology: Analog
0, Tasteless and pathetic: A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives
0, May I use your Umbrella?: ....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel
0, BAD MOVIE: My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie
0, Awful: This book just isn't worth it. Whether one is or is not an Imus fan
0, IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY: This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio
0, Huge problem with this book!: There is one huge problem with the premise of this book and that is that MARY DOES NOT HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. She is ever-virgin and has only birthed Jesus
1, Most Relaxing: My husband bought this CD for me many years ago...copyright date 1993. After 14 years of listening
0, The Digital Caliper Did not work!: I am very disatisfied! I purchased this as a Christmas present. We got a call 2 days later saying it did not work! I tried to contact Apex Tools and they never returned my calls! Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and that I cannot return because no one has returned my call!
1, Nice for the price: Really nice quality for the price. Nice case for storage and protection when not in use. Easy to use and the spare battery is a nice bonus.
1, Digital calipers: Good quality calipers with digital readout at a terrific price. Very useful measuring device for my wood shop.
1, Good Tool Low Price: This is a great tool! it is quite accurate for a low price. not much more to say
0, Worth what you pay for it - no more!: If you think there's some magic and you're getting a precision digital caliper for $9
1, Great condition: Another book with which I was very pleased with its condition. It also came in the time allowed for. I was very pleased.
1, Wonderful Period Piece: Most of us know the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - likely through Disney's well-crafted and true to the original adaptation of this Washington Irving classic
0, I'm done with this show....: I used to love this show
0, Please send me the product: Many weeks ago I bought this product and it is not shiped yet
1, Having fun watching it: I love it. the story is interesting
0, naked truth: I was not trying to buy this because I already bought the entire season. I just could not get it to play so I think I ended up paying again.
0, still waiting: I think one have to be very passionated about the delivery time
1, Captured Live!!: NRBQ have released a few live recordings but this one seems to capture the band's comraderie. They are having fun and so is the audience. Everything seems spontaneous yet well coordinated. They are a fun
0, bad: i dont like to read books but i will read a book that gets my attention and when i started reading this book i hated it this book was very boring and uninteresting and just dull nothing interesting happened. the main girls sister had diabetes then shes hospitalized because she doesnt want to do what she has to then they get a new house guest who tells the girl about the pirate queen and the dad isnt around much in the book but thats not really anything interesting because the way it was written it just didnt get my attention at all.written by courtnee E.
0, Total Waste: This is one of the greatest wastes of talent I've seen in some time - and I've seen some stinkers. Why Caan and Powers accepted this script is beyond me but at least they survived its embarrassment and went on to much greater things. I can forgive a lot in a Western and can avoid the others but this one should just quietly be forgotten.
1," You need to give this one some time. Rewards will come.: The first time I heard this I thought I'd finally found it. A truly unworthy Robert Pollard/GBV release. The first impression you'll get is ""where's the tunes"
1, The Offical All My Children Trivia Book: I bought this book because my FAVORITE show was taken off. It is a great collector book for people like me. It contained things that I had forgotten about even though I had watched the show for 40 years.
0, Survival Island
0, Sucked: You know those movies that make you feel sick and disgusted
1, 5 Stars for Kelly Brook!: If you like Kelly Brook the British bombshell you should see this movie! Kelly is hot running around the island in a white bikini. There are also some nude scenes and Kelly shows off her perfect legs
0, Really?: So
0, useless product: when i first received the product
1, Satisfied: Other than one of the two screws needed to install this product was missing
1, small but mighty: great product if you only use 12 oz cans; had a party
1, Best Can Crusher: I can't believe I have been crushing and recycling cans for 30 years and have been wasting my time with other crushers. I just installed the Easy Pull crusher and got to work crushing the cans that have backed up since my old crusher died and all I can say is Wow! Easy Pull is hands down the best can crusher I have ever used
0, Junk!!: This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.
0, No caller ID: As the last review says - I too did not realize this model does not have caller ID. Sellers should state this specifically. Very disappointed as well. Wish I had seen the previous complaint before purchasing.
0, Cats had fleas within a month: Both cats were infested with fleas
1, Space Invaders: Space Invaders rocks!!! The cool 3-D graphics are so cool! I have it for Game Boy Advance SP. I got all the way through the game and won!!! It is a great game to play!
1, Just Plain Fun: Sure the graphics aren't stunning but for some unexplicable reason this game is just plain fun
0, The only book that I actually wish to never even see again.: The first time I tried to read this and failed I assumed that maybe I was distracted and would try again later. The second time I convinced myself that I had too many books on the go at the one time. The third time I told myself that I was too busy to give it the time it deserved. Frankly
1, Tender: One of the most tender and true to the heart works by E.M. Forster
0, Blurry
0, I would rather scrape: I dont care for this item. I would rather scrape the windshield off. The elastic is to short to hook onto anything. I bought two and they are going in with our rummage sale items
1, GREAT PRODUCT.: the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for 10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
1, There is no better Physics text for the non-Ph.D. reader.: This excellent series of texts covers almost every topic in modern physics. This is the only book on Physics that covers all this complex physics topics that could be understood by anyone with a college degree. However
0, The lame observations of an unfunny man.: I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics. He presents his humorless observations as if they have some bearing in absolute truth
0, Can you say boring three times fast?: Oh
1, clever: I liked this book. I can't say I loved it (hence
0, you're better off reading cocoa puff box.: This book is a complete waste of time. I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities. The author says that there's only one probability in life: 50/50
0, Limited Coverage: I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country. For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $50. get an AAA book
0, Rip-off!: Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product. The coverage is absurd. In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location. Nada
0, Hampered by use of custom libraries: Being an O'Reilly fan it is hard for me to find fault with their no-nonsense approach to technical books
1, 'The Engager' - works good: Our company had some trailers that had dead batteries in the 'break-away' systems. Instead of just replacing batteries - (which were quite expensive) I decided to replace the whole system. Found the 'Hopkins Engager' at Amazon. It was cheaper than a battery for our existing systems and came with a switch and everything else new. It was easy to install and it works good. I really like the battery meter that tells if your charge circuit is working on the pull vehicle. Good product
1, Prior Reviews Are Not of This Set: I have not heard all of this set yet. I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great. The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music. None of the reviews are of this set. All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.More later.
0, Terrible quality control.: The Charge TTi that I received was stuck on one side so the bottle opener and screwdriver would not open or lock correctly. I understand that titanium can be difficult to work with
1, Perfect Tool!: This product is really nice. I love how light weight it is
0, Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.: I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
1," Founding ""god"" father: This streamlined synopsis of the teachings of Jesus Christ is drawn from the gospels of the bible without any religious dogma. The parables Jesus spoke are compiled nicely and provided me with the life lessons which I attempt to live by."
1, Piece of American History: This bargain is an impoprtant piece of American history. Jefferson was a diest
1, Wolf Woman is the best book I have ever read: Wolf Woman is an exciting story I read. It was about a girl called Wolf-Woman by the clan.Tanith is meant to be part of a family but is treated like an outsider. Then this man
0, Borrrrrring: I heard about the game on TV & thought it looked like sooooo much fun
1," erinsmom: Love this diaper bag-the only negative thing about it is that I tend to ""over fill"" my diaper bag"
1, Not Much Room: I like the bag. It's stylish
1, Hillman is authoritative
1, Way to go
0, disappointed: this item did nothing to educate nor inform the audience of the artist Vincent VanGogh as a person nor his work
1, a bomb ... streetball title for your ps2: When I first purchased this game
1, STREET HOOPS: STREET HOOPS IS THE BEST BASKETBALL/AND1 GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.IT IS SO TIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY GAME MODES LIKE ;KING OF THE COURT
1, This book speaks to the heart of life: I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life. I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference. Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed. I have given a copy of this book to both my sons. I want them to be fulfilled men.
1, Hope in Suffering: Viktor Emil Frankl
1, Search for Meaning: At times this book can be a little dry
1, Interesting: This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps. It examines our behavior in times of extreme stress.
1," A path from apathy...: From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the ""existential vacuum"""
1, Get a hard copy: If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you. If you need a change in perspective this is a book for you. If you feel like a victim
1, Very meaningful read: This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
1, Inspiring: I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
1, A book that can help you lifelong: This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power
1," A MUST Read!: This is life-changer upon one's mindset for facing the trials in life. A truly awesome book. I first received this book as a gift and when I saw the title I knew that this was a book that I would never have bought for myself because of the title ""Man's Search for Meaning"". Because as a Christian I understand the meaning of life. But this book deepened my understanding of adversity and I found it to be of great value. I then ordered two more books; each for 2 men serving life in prison and I hope this turns their despair to joy."
1, A Must Read: This is a book everyone needs to read at least one or more times.Viktor Frankl has given us invaluabletools for living. His experience hasbrought Logotherapy into being.He gives hope a whole new meaning.
1, Best PS2 Motorcycle Game.: This is the best PS2 bike game available. It isn't perfect
1, Sundrinker by Zach Hughes: A great page turner!! Over much too soon!! This one is heartly recommended and most readers will simply devour it!!
1, Money
0, Fails at its basic purpose Try another brand: These type of toys are supposed to slide out of your hands when you grab them. However this one has a very large (about 1/2 inch) seam where the two pieces are fitted together. That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes
1, Yeah for Little Bear!: Once again Little Bear and his adorable
1, bear flick: very sweet. keeps our three year old entertained for a while. little bear has always been a favorite in our family.
0, Books review.: Paper material is bad
0, Could have been way more fabulous: The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series
1, Good show
0," From Fab 5 to Drab 13: One of the best parts about the show ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" has to be the music - bouncy"
1, Good for working out: Good work-out mix but I could have done without two of the songs on this CD. Otherwise
1, Except for the theme song no biggie: CD in perfect condition. I was hoping the other songs were as good as the theme song. Would perchase only if really into the background songs used on the show.
0, Not as good as the rest: My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time
1, oh yeah: this is one of those albums with atmosphere. listen to the whole thing through
0, okay game: this game [disappoints]i thought this would be a good game but the graphics [disappoint]and the camera views are awful
0, What?: I am very glad I rented this first. I thought it would be good...judging by the good rating. But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I've played.
1, Jim Croce Classic Hits: I received this CD as a gift for my birthday as I had heard it at a friend's house. The music is soothing
0, WHY this single on BILLBOARD HOT 100 top 10
1, Audubon Guide to African Wildlife: Excellent book with awesome color pictures and good concise narrative on each species and subspecies. It was very easy to identify all the various animals (large and small) and birds when on safari in Tanzania. Highly recommend .
1, If you Love textile art
0, Disappointing: After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future.
1, Very old.: The original build fest game imo
0, There are much better games out there: I recieved this game with several others. The graphics might have been good in 2003
1, An Excellent and Practical Guide To Grammar: I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical
1, well done: well written
0, Kimi is disgusting: She is a little poser!!! Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper
1, Brilliant Movie!: This movie is great for the whole family ! I love it ! Its cute 
1, LOVE: SMARTEST IDEA EVER AMAZON!!! I HAVE BEEN HONESTLY WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO HAPPEN EXCEPT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY FULL SEASONS. I WANT A FULL SEASON OF RUGRATS!:)
1, Great Family Movie: I took my daughter to see this when it was in the movie theater and she loved it so much that I purchased it for her when it came out on VHS/DVD! This is a great movie for young & old! Great family fun & entertainment! Fans of the Rugrats will be cheering for more!If you want to purchase a movie for a child that is a fan of the Rugrats then this is your movie!
1, Wow...: This statue is an amazing piece. The level of detail and craftsmanship is top notch. I'm glad I was able to pick up this piece while it was still available. I'm kicking myself for missing out on the Skeletor statue that was available a couple years ago.
1, Mind and Finger Stimulation: You not only learn how to type more words per minute
1, A Great First CD: Elliott Yamin's new CD is a great new summer release.His easy going
1, Just wonderful!!!: It is so nice to listen to a cd without the usual AI overproducing touches. This is music to not only enjoy listen to but music that you feel!! The songs are so real and heartfelt and I am just enjoying this cd so much. I haven't felt this way about a cd in a long time. There is something for everybody. ballads
1, One Word: Amazing...: I woke up at 7AM to go get this CD and it was worth being tired all day at work. Elliott's voice can bring a grown man to tears. There is not one bad song on this CD. I still wonder how Mr. Yamin did not win American Idol 5. He is the most talented person to come out of the competition. I highly recommend that you get this CD and buy copies for all of your friends. Look out world
1, way to go Elliot!: Great cd. I listen to it all the time! Can't wait for his next one. I'm proud of you Elliot!
1, Elliott's AMAZING: I love it. I have never bought an American Idol record before... I've heard the songs they HAD to put out and hated them. I thought Elliott was so good on American Idol that I thought
0, Late: This book took forever to get. I didn't recieve it for a month! Emailed and recieved no responce.
0, A good approach but filled with errors.: There are too many errors in this edition to recommend it to a beginner. Approximately 75 errors were encountered. For a second edition
1, Fantastic: My husband says this cd rates in his all time favorite top 5
1, Where to find on DVD: Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit. She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father. If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD
0, This is the one: to get if you don't really want to hear what Bird was all about but want to have something in your collection by him. That's what this record was designed to do
0, Couldn't Deal With The Strings...: If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker
0, yeah ... right!: Why are there two prats giving this 5 out of 5. They are so obviously joke reviews. This is an awful movie and the zombie scenes are shut with a low shutter speed
0," BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE!: i saw this movie on SCI-FI last night! this movie is supposedly a ""zombie"" flick! after watching the part were they come in i was like ""wait .. wait oh wait they aren't zombies their ghosts!""even killing scenes were AWFUL i swear this movie looks like if it were a MADE FOR TV movie or something! the ""killing"" scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen! but this movie is more of a family drama about a son who finally gets to meet his dad after so long and they both save each other!this whole movie should have just been an 1 hour instead of 2!you could sum up the whole flim in 1 hour cause is all their doing is driving in the dessert and encountering revenageful ghosts and only 3 of them surive!skip this movie and go for ""return of the living dead""!"
0, Surprisingly BORING.: I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here
1, if you enjoy music...get this: very well produced...great musiciansif you enjoy the guitar or rock at all
1, Fantastic!!: Such a great experience watching three generations of Rock guitarists come together to share their stories an experiences.I hope other musicians and fans get an opportunity to view this. It's quite a testament to music and how it has a profound effect on musicians and music lovers alike!
1, Best guitar movie ever!: I went in special search of this film on blu-ray
1, Innovative Gem: A factual docudrama-like film. The visuals in this one are so cool
1, I'm stunned there is no US DVD...great film: Can it be that the only DVD edition of this is for non-US countries? I think this film is brilliant. From start to finish
0, DO NOT BUY this published version: I'm suggesting not buying this text
1, Retro gaming at its best.: This is a wonderful collection of games from the creative heyday of the video game industry. These are bit-perfect ports of the original games; the Playstation is emulating the 1980-era hardware and the original game code is running on the emulator. All the original gameplay is there
1, VHS very good new 
0, Not as good: I rented this game and I am glad that I didn't buy it right away. The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it. Bottom line
1," The weakest of Jordan's series.: I believe this book had only one purpose -- to be a seg-way into the next. But where is the next? This novel lacks the exciting conclusion that I've come to expect. It ended so ""wide open"" that a reader can't help being frustrated. I hope that Mr. Jordan is alive and well"
0, That's it...: After spending a lot of time with this series
0, Crown of Bores: I really enjoyed the first three books of the Wheel of Time. In fact I thought they were excellent. Book 5 was horrible
1," Another great adition to the Wheel of time series...: Some people will say this book is slow. Well it is only true for the slow minded. This book is an addition to the series in a more ""fill-in-the-blanks"" way. It is very good that he did it because sometimes you look back on a story and it just doesn't make any sense. -A very smart adition to the series."
0, To rest on one's laurals...: To rest on one's laurals is to write the later installments of the wheel of time series. I feel like I have been taken for a buggy ride... at my own expense. Stick to the earlier parts because they are something else.
1, I can go on with this forever: Robert Jordan is maybe one of the best authors I have ever read. From the first book to the seventh and soon eighth everyone was a wonder in itself. These books are filled with evergoing suspence
1," Very enjoyable: Like the rest of the series. This book was gripping from the beginning to the end. Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time Seriers is the best I have read. It is more compelling than David Eddings ""The Belgariad"""
0, the beginning of the end: Indeed
1, GGGGGRRRRREEEEEAAAAAATTTT: Finally a series of books that takes the time and does it properly. My feeling when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings was that it all finished too soon. Leaps are made
0, ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH: At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am. What started out as an epic
1, Jordan is Awesome: This is by far the most gripping series of books I have ever read. I hope this series goes on FOREVER ! Kill off the Forsaken slowly....and bring back Moiraine-We miss her. I buy the hardback edition of each book and do not sleep until I have finished the book !! I have read these books over and over again....I love them
1, Should I or shouldn't I buy #7?: I went through much of the reviews for book #7 and it's pretty split between the pros and cons.I'm almost done with #6
1, The best fantasy series since Tolkien: I waited a long time for this book
1, music with soul: i am sick and tired of reading all these reviews that diss g. love and his sound. music critics desparately try and pigeon-hole him into a category with little sucess. i have heard him compared to acts as varied as beck and soul coughing. why don't people understand that this cd is just fun music that you can move to? i'm not trying to act like i know g. and what he is trying to do with his music
0, Nice but short life: The device is nice
1, So many twists and turns: This is a fun film. You never know what will happen next or who the good guys are. Unlike most standard Hollywood films where you know who's the good guy
0, Poorly Written: I admit that my programming experience is rather limited
1, City of God: I received my order on time and in perfect condition. I would definately buy from this seller again.
0, Mold: Bought this book for class and the text was covered in mold. Working on trying to remove the mold now.
1, Pilot's Perspective: I like adventure books
0, Presentation of concepts needs improvement: This booked is packed with information however the presentation needs vast improvement.Specifically the inclusion of a concept map at the beginning that gives a graphic view of hte concepts to be presented. Then concepts maps of each chapter's topics is necessary then. And if possible more concept maps for topics with in each chapter. These concepts would be more understandable with concept maps as graphic organizers of the information presented.
1, More blues and less rock on this one: Marcia is a fine singer who writes many of her own songs
1, God bless you Jake: This book was our Brass Tech. textbook in college. It was great reading it and understanding so much. What helped was our professor had studied with Mr. Jacobs and had a little more insight. This book is very informative
1, Great game: Picture quality=5sound=3gameplay=4over all the only mess up is that the controls were to loose
1," soon to be the greatest guitar player ever.....great music!!: not as technical as his last cd but the music reflects exactly what the title is ""undiscovered soul"" Great job Richie"
1, Superb camera -- Buy it now!: I've used this camera now for 6 months and own 3
1, Cute: These shoes are better than I expected. They are adorable and decent enough quality
1, Great Time shoe!: I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on! They are pretty comfortable and fun!
1, Halloween Shoes: Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
0, Rent before you Buy: What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie. I fell asleep half way thru this bomb and didn't want to waste another 3 bucks renting this a 2nd day to finish it.
1, Worth it: Surprisingly
0, hm: I would say that the only thing less interesting than the movie itself were the special features included in the disk.Ok
1, yes!: this is the best movie I've ever seen. the story is great and the actors couldn't have been chosen any better. I love u vin diesel!
0," Tied with White Chicks for worst Movie of 2004: How many science fiction and fantasy cliches can you put in a movie? Just watch Riddick and start counting. I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD. Pitch Black was great but for this ""sequel"" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie. The acting was laughable. The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars"
1, Beautiful butterfly book: I loved the book because of the beautiful color pictures
1, Audubon Society Field Guides: Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.
1, Peterson's is better: This one comes in second. It's definitely for the amateur and is very nicely illustrated. My main beef is it requires too much page flipping and the organization is poor. The one I prefer in the field is Peterson's. It's more pocket sized and quicker for reference use.
0, TOO OLD: It was last revised in 2002
0, slow and repetitious: Having made it to page 88
1, one of my favs: This one of my favorite books of Chris'. I have read them all and can't wait for the next one to come out. He's a great story teller and has a great duo in Jon and David to carry from book to book. Exact.
0, Don't even bother with this one: It it wern't for Russell Crowe
0, Nice but: I saw this movie about four times on a transatlantic flight yesterday (well I really watched it only once...) and I found it somewhat entertaining but not really exciting. Maybe that's a good thing. The drama side was refreshingly life-like (too bad it doesn't cater for today's scandal-hungry soap opera audience).On the other hand
0, So So Movie: This movie had decent ratings on imdb. I wanted to see an action flick with a mix of thriller. This movie was ok and that exciting. All this have going for it is Russell Crowe.
1, Very Realistc: Although it takes a little while to get rolling
1, Superman like you've never seen before: You like superman? You like Russians? The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter
0, Shallow vision of Socialism. Mediocre at best: Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind
1, One of the better Disney films of the 1980s.: Full of adventure and mystery
0, It stinks: All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes
1, MANKIND'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT: When the aliens land in my backyard
1, Very good movie: A Very good movie
1, Great movie!!!!: Godfather director and great cast. Besides the known big names in the movie
1, this isn't a bubble gum
0, Poor DVD quality: I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor. towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying.
0, You really have to be kidding me.....: I'm sorry but I just don't get it.This is a long movieThis is a boring movieI could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
0, I wanted to turn this disc into a coaster...: It may be a classic to many people
0, BORING
0, New BluRay: Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
0, Don't let the packaging fool you!: I own all 3 apocalypse now's (original
0, Two stars for redux five for the original: Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place
1, Another Coppola Masterpiece: Indeed Apocalypse Now is one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces
1, Haunting Film
1," The greatest war film in history: It puts ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"" in the shade. This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever. It topically transfers the setting of Joseph Conrad's epic novella ""Heart of Darkness"" from the Congo to Vietnam"
1, ''this is the end..'': astonishing film
1, Good classic: This album made earth wind and fire a pop group. Shining Star
1, EWF is still the best.: I listened to this album as a high school student and am happy to have the remastered CD in my possesion. See the Light is still my favorite song
1, Greatest of All Time: This
1, Mortal Kombat Trilogy the bomb?: MKT is really a great game! It takes all of the best features from MK1-3 and translates them flawlessly onto the Playstation platform. This allows die-hard fans like me to play it without the Sega or SNES. However there are two glitches that kind of bother me. One is the fatalities. Sub-Zero's old rip of the head is cut out
1, Mortal Kombat!!!: Personally I think that this is the last of the good Mortal Kombats
1, if color doesnt matter this is for you: Fits perfect just a taupe color but it was cheaper to get this color than to get black. We needed for an extra vehicle so it worked perfectly.
0, Elevator Bensusan.: Yuk. Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts. In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different. The problem is
1, This has been my absolute favorite movie since i saw it: This is movie fosuses on an 11 year old girl's life.she has no mother
1, My favourite move EVER!: This movie is good too the end! It shows the uncertainties of being a young girl
1, She is Strange
0," Let Down: I heard a lot of people talking up this album on the Grammy's so I bought after hearing only the too much played cut"" I try"". I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about dragging some black girl off the shreets to prop up in front of a mike. I miss spelled streets similar to spelling ""you"" ""chu"" . Come on folks this is not even audable english. I bought Tracy Chapmans new one at the same time and WHAT a contrast. Macy Grey is going to the used dc store."
1, Talking all night long: I sat up all night. I talk to this beautiful lady I met all night long while this
1, Macy Gray is one of the best: I loved that song I TRYED and the rest is really good too. I am looking forward to buying her album
0," Puh-lease!: I can't turn my radio fast enough when I hear ""I Try"" coming on. It's like a car wreck. You don't want to see it"
1, Gray Matters: This is a strong
0, Turkey Rather Than One Star:: What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough
0, the dishwasher !!: I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell
0, Pretty much what you'd expect: I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer
0, Have no interest in it: I just got this for my class and I just not interested about other people. I'm more interested in creating things than reading about it.
0, Help your Dog Fight Cancer: This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject. Also a very moving story which I will read over and over again!The info on veterinarians
1, great camera: a great camera to take with you every day takes great pictures and takes up no room in your pocket
1, Best game I've ever played: If you like video games this game is a must have. It features awesome graphics and is 3D. If you can get only one game for your Game Cube get this one!!!Pacman has always been my favorite game except it has been in 2D this is the 1st Pacman Game I've Played that is actually in 3D!!!VERY long game that takes weeks to beat!!!tHE BOTTOM LINE IS TO BUY THIS GAME!!!
0, The movie was positively dreadful: I didn't have high hopes for this film
0, Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen: Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell
0, ... really?: Will Ferrell has been in some hilariously wonderful movies. Elf
0, stay away from this movie: I have seen many movies
0, Warped tale should get lost and stay there: Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Bad dialogue2. Bad acting3. Bad script4. Bad movie - bad
0," Two hours of my life wasted: If you are a fan of the original TV series you will be sorely disappointed. This movie bears little resemblance to the TV show other than character names and some sleestak. If you are not familiar with the TV series and have no expectations then you might find it mildly entertaining if you have a ""simple"" sense of humor. But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb."
0, Horrible! Absolutly horrible! Worst movie ever!: Horrible
0, Terrible and a waste of time and money: This is the worst movie you will ever watch...no plot
0, 1 star = 1 laugh: this movie was terrible. the dialog seemed as if it was written by a high school student
1, A VERY FUNNY SEQUEL TO AMERICAN PIE!: I got a VCD of this movie from my friend (which was in terrible quality) and thought it was hilarious. I even invited a couple of girl friends over to watch it with me
1, A Better Pie: American Pie 2 was an excellent sequel to the first American Pie movie. The story is pretty simple. Everyone's now in College
0," this cant be happening: I cant believe that a sequel came out for american piesame tasteless humorsame story linesame starssame everythingthis is just another attempt by filmakers to make high schoolers think that when they go to ""college"" its going to be one beer guzzling party after another and they will get through their first year with flying colorsI know this because it brainwashed a buncha of students at my school"
1, Hilarious!: Irreverant comedy at its finest! The sequel was better than the original
1, Fusion jazz gem from the masters: This hard to find CD is a must for fans of fusion jazz. The groundbreaking quartet of Chick Corea
0, This DVD has not been released yet: Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received. I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04. Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet.
0, More like The Snore.: OK
0, A caveat to DVD purchasers: WARNING to anyone thinking of purchasing the D-Vision DVD edition of THE TERROR: It is not the letterbox edition touted in Amazon's writeup (my sole reason for ordering it). REPEAT: It is not widescreen; it is in full-screen format
1, Humourous Insight: Potpourri of life is a poetic and humourous look in the problems that so many of us face in our everyday lives. When is the second book coming?
0," Leave your brain and taste at the door: ""Danger Kitty"" has mass produced some of the worst music in the history of Pop. To all of the BJ fans out there"
0," So incredibly overrated..: Bon Jovi are in close competition with Nirvana for the ""Most Overrated Band in History"" award. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the cr@ppy ""Living on a Prayer"" played on the radio"
0, Wow was this bad!: I just got back from seeing this terrible
0, Ridiculous!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Heath Ledger
1," Don't buy the ""Extended"" Edition!: If you're a fan of Brian Helgeland"
0, Save Your Money: This movie ranks right next to Red Tomahawck as one of the worst movie I have seen. The acting is not bad but the story was as cliche ridden as the fifth sequeal to a Rocky movie. You see better stories in old Tarzan movie's. How many time's can you watch a knight get struck while riding a horse. Heath Ledger is the Babe Ruth of knight's. There are no odd's he cannot overcome and man those he overcome the odd's. Superman better watch out. Now if Sylvester Stallone was a knight then you would have a contest. Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish.
1, The Best: I saw this movie and LOVED IT!!!! It was the best ever. The soundtrack is really good too. The characters are well delveloped. In my opinion it is a football movie but with horses and lances. This is my all time favorite movie!
1, Rock and Roll Jousting: The soundtrack is a character all its own in this film. This is the story of a poor young boy who grows up in the shadow of a jousting champion
0, Drivel: OK
0, Nobody want's to be this Mama's boys Valentine.: Your typical
1, The best moddern day horror film of them all!: Let me start out by saying that this movie will make the easily scared piss their pants! The origionality of this film is so hard to come by these days. When a group of attractive young girls humiliate a nerd at the valentines day dance
0, Tom Savage should sue: This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen. Whereas the book was a five star thriller
0, This game sucks: Yes
0, HUH>?: I rented this game expecting some fast and furious gameplay
0," Extremly desapointing!!: I first read ""Kane & Abel"" also by J. Archer"
0, Soap opera: This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
1, Recommendation with Enthusiasm: Before reaching the end of this novel
0, Lost interest after the hot tub scene.: This movie had plenty of laughs
0," Since When Does ONE Deleted Scene = ""Special Features?"": If you loved this movie and want the DVD for the outrageous special features you can't get on rental DVDs - outtakes"
1, Great purchase: I chose to buy this during the Black Friday deals weekend and it's a great purchase! This was a great purchase!
1, Good Movie
0, Not as funny as I expected: This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).
0, a very disappointing movie.: whats up with hollywood? what a big disappointment. I want watch another movie that Peter Farrelly directs or if he's even is involved with it.
0, Sucked: Some funny parts here and there
1, HIGHEST Recommendation: I loved every word of this book. Knock your socks off story
1, Best of a Classic: He may be old
0, This book was just terrible: I think my title says it all
0," Buy the Update: I bought this book for $250 and I also bought ""How to Create and Manage a Mutual Fund or Exchange-Traded Fund"" 9780470120552 for ~$70. This book was paper back and the ""How to create..."" book was hardback and copy written 3 years later (2008 compared to 2005 of this book.) The words are mostly the same on the mutual fund side"
0, Did I just get a lemon?: I find the reviews that extol this as a long-serving workhorse quite interesting -- and frustrating. I had this chopper and used it only about a half dozen times
0, Junk: Creates mush
0, Frustrating and ineffective.: I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective. Food is always getting under the blades
1, chopper/mincer: This Black & Decker chopper/mincer although small provides an excellent service for us. Perhaps we are easily satisfied because of the size of our hosehold
1, Infrequent Chopper: I don't cook much but when I do
0, The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.: The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than 1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one
1, Great: I work at a fire dept
0, The worst chopper I have ever used
0, Don't watch this movie!: This movie is total Bull! anybody who claims to like it
0, dissapointing: The book is pretty good
0, dull and pointless: This movie starts off like a mystery/thriller
0, Bad Movie: Typical excellent acting by Nicholson
0, Just bad: Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance in this slow plodding movie.Jack clearly made this movie as a favor to his friend Sean Penn.Penn should stick to acting.The cut aways the distracting music
1, Classroom Teacher Loved It: The first time I heard this book was while I was a guest teacher in second grade classroom. A parent choose to read this book to the class and they were enthralled. They could not take their eyes off the book and they could not stop talking about it afterwards. The next week when I was filling in for the librarian I decided to read this book to the third graders. They loved it partly because it was a new book to add to their holiday favorites. I wanted to add it to my library before the holidays but the book was nowhere to be found
0, Don't buy: Stay away from baseball game this year. Without MVP baseball having the mlb license
1, Great Game: It is a great game. The rosters are updated really good. Except it doesn't have my favorite baseball player Barry Bonds. There is a lot of new gane modes like Rivalry Mode. I like Franchise mode a lot it's fun.I thought MLB 2K6 would be better but it's not I rated it 5 stars to. I think you should get MLB 06 THE SHOW if you like really realistic games but get MLB 2K6 if you like kind of realistic games but is real easy.
1, What are you waitn' for?: Hey everbody this Cd is awesome...the girls rock
1," great album: I really like this album. ""So Good"" is a really good upbeat song"
0, an OK album
1, COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!: I thought this CD was sooooo cool. At first
1, One of the best Courtroom Dramas: Amazing screenplay put on screen. A three hour journey back into the JFK controversy which shook up America and the world. Costner in rare form gives an unbelievable performance. A must see.
1, Most Accurate Movie Ever: Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
1," Blew my mind.: I relived the same moments JFK had.And Oliver Stone saying that ""JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive.""Not just chilling"
0, Poor history
1, So
0, Some good advice
0, dull!: its a dull film- theres not nearly enough JRM in it as id liked and some unknown reason we keep getting these pictures of rivers and babies and this Adam and Eve duo! does anyone understand what its about except the director?
1, Gotta see it to believe it.: 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Blue Velvet. It's as carefully paced and music-laden as the former
0, B.S.
0, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION: Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches all right
0, Dumb As Hell 
0, Lied about the size: We love this movie and it was listed as 1:77 in size. When we recieved it the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don
0, Whiz Bang Ending But it misses the mark.: Well after watching a wonderfully violent
0, Boring!!!!!!!!!!!: Kurt was pulling a arnold job. I think he had about two lines of dialoge through out the intire movie. The story is pretty good.I'm sorry I purchased it. Should have rented it first.
0, Stay Away!: My experience with this device was horrible. It took weeks to get it to work right
1, The Shop Around the Corner: They don't make romantic comedies like they used to
1, What You've Got Mail Should Have Been: With an ensemble cast that could only exist when the studio system was in full flower
1," Corner Shop review: wonderful movie! Classic Jimmie Stewart. Great for the entire family to watch. If you enjoyed ""You've Got Mail"" with Ryan and Hanks"
1, Excelente livro!: Uma rápida olhada no índice do livro atestam que estou diante de um conteúdo bastante promissor. O papel e a impresso deixam a desejar. A encadernao é frágil para o tamnho do livro.
1, I echo the 5-star rating of this book: I was introduced to this book by staff at my local children's book store. I was intrigued with the concept of the book being written from the perspective of a boy's journal
1, Love that Book!: It's a charming
0, Simply disappointing! I don't recommend this album to anyone!: It seems that all the energy
1," Authour recreates his own life story.: Neil Albert's ""monthly series"" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do"
1, A Classic from an Early Hippie Band: The themes of the songs may seem dated to younger listeners
1, Excellent CD!: I only recently learned about this band. This greatest hits CD contains lots of the songs played on satellite radio while I'm driving to work. Great band ! I love the singer. I only wish they were not broken up. An excellent bargain for a fan
1, Very good: The cd was purchased as a Christmas gift and I assume everything was fine with it. Your service was excellent and was received in a timely manner. Thank you
1, Full Poster Sized: Nice poster for a violin teachers room. It would make a nice chart for beginners. Really everything on the chart is in your beginning books
0, even schwarzenegger must hope this one goes away: with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!
1, Better!: I liked this book a lot better then the previous one! I really liked how Christine really pursued God in what she should do concerning her relationship with Eric! Overall great read!
0, NOT worth 10$: I bought this set a while ago because it looked unique and fun. Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it
1, good product: really like this product. I would recommend this product if you are looking for this type of item for your computer needs.

I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!In this book Arthur enters the story (actually

0," Aggressive Defense of Marriage: The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie (""I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22"") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed"

0, Star Trek: Gateways Book One - One Small Step: This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!
1, Life is just an edless waltz: Endless waltz is an awsome movie. the special edition DVD includes the OVA episiodes of the movie
0, GRAND: I watched the movie on Cartoon Network about two years ago. It's an excellent movie
1, You Get What You Pay For: This is not a bad product
1, Eternal Truth: These reflective
0, Torture: When Marvin Mange is involved in a fatal car accident
1, The Animal (Uncut Special Edition): rob's funny and it can sometimes not be funny but over all it's a great laugh.
1, Schneider does it again!: If you've seen Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and liked Rob Schneider's performance (no pun intended) as much as I did - then you'll love The Animal! Same kind of goofy humor. Will definitely be buying this on DVD when it's released.
1, Listen to it again: When I first heard this album
1, In My Opnion: J.R.R. Tolken is an amazing writer
0, boring!!!!: most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux
0, I only put 1 star so people would read this :-): Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think 
1, The Two Towers
1, The Heart of ot All: We return to Middle- Earth in <u>Return of the King<u/>
1, Wonderful Storytelling. Worthy Tolkien Novel.: In the Second Volume of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy
1, Ella and Louis: Now this one is a no-brainer:EVERYBODY knows by now how great idea was teaming Ella (at her peak) and Louis (close enough to his peak) on this album
1, not so bad: although i would have to say not my fav movie of all time
0, crummy crummy crummy: this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
0, Ouch This Movie Hurts: I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews. I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film. The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched. Outside of that this movie is a train wreck. The plot is a waste of time. The acting is over the top and hammy. On of the most egregious parts is the sound. The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing. Beware the casual movie goer won't be swayed by girls in bikinis.
0, I wish no stars were an option: I believe catching every disease on earth at once would be more pleasant than watching this movie. It's not even worth a penny
0, I had no other choice but to read this book.: This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait
1, good movie.: My daughter was doing a report on Christa McAuliffe. We rented this after she had done her report. She enjoyed actually seeing how the space program worked.
1, END OF ONE SERIES AND ACTUAL START OF ANOTHER: Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for
0, Don't waste your time or money: I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money. Every dream I have looked up so far was negative
0, Not a good Kindle edition: Unfortunately
1, Alice's BIG Adventures in Wonderland: I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful
0, Only Two Stars for the Penguin Edition: It's a fantastic book
0, In the Rabbit Hole: This is not a pretty edition. For a serviceable edition just to read the wonderful words of these stories and to have them together
0," get a magnifying glass: I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no ""preview"" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book"
1, Not Just a Beloved Children's Book!: This book is a delight to both young and old
0, Where is the Looking Glass?: I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel
1, alice in wonderland: this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!
0," Too little technique too much speculation and opinion: With phrases like ""Because extreme physical regimens like bodybuilding are so unhealthy"
1, Very Excellent: This game is a must if you like first person 3d shooter. Quake provides a wide variety of game play. The multiplayer aspect of the game makes it worth playing over and over. There are many mods (modifacations) that you can add on for extra and different game play. Team Fortress
0," not the first choice: Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful ""Getz/Gilberto"""
1, Great read!: This was my first Stuart Woods book. It has a great pace
1, Stan and Ollie in the Trenches: Fully restored to its original 68-minute length
0, One of the worst movies I have ever seen: Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum
0, A let down: The Simple Minds (a brass band in african chimes) and Mansun (wide open space) tracks are super
0, Slow and amateurish: Poorly done and as stated quite amateurish. It simply did not get moving and finally turned it off. If it got any better I'd be surprised.
0, boring: Movie was very boring
1," A ""Must Have"" for college dorm rooms: We have 4 kids and got our first Hot Shot when they all lived at home. We love it and use it almost everyday. It became the ""must have"" for college item as each of them went off to college over the last 7 years. We just bought the last one for our youngest who is going to college this fall. We've also bought them for graduation gifts for friends and general family gifts - they are greatly appreciated and used. Wish Amazon would buy these in bulk and make them available for free shipping ; )"
0, This guide sucks: After ascertaining that this was the best market guide for me to purchase in order to get my novel published I gladly ordered it. Well
0, piece of garbage: I bought mine almost 1 year ago
1, Had to send it back!: I really like the product
1, Good: Three CD set of piano music.Long
0, Quality could be better: It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
1, Best Music Video Ever!!!: This is a video that you will want to watch over & over & over - and love every time. Absolutely the best music video ever made.
0, wasted money: I am restricted to a wheelchair
1, Desert Island Essential: I have made a gift of this album to a number of my friends. If I had to pick only 10 pieces of music ever
0, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT SPYING: This is not an espionage thriller as the cover and title of this book would have you beleive. The vast majority of the content in this book is about how two people working in the CIA fall in love with each other and how they are so excited being around one another. I for one
0, Poorly written love story
0, Poorly Written with Virtually No Story Line to Follow: WOW....I never thought a publishing house would allow a book to be published without having an editor read it first. The authors desperately needed to employ a ghostwriter for assistance.The story line is almost impossible to follow
1, Hilariously slanted look at history: This movie is great! Highly entertaining
0, Whatever you do don't waste your money on this movie: Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it. All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This movie was terrible. I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie. The movie was supposed to be a comedy
1, Keeps you laughing: Well you don't have to be a history buff to get the gags in this movie. Both lead actresses have that ditzy
0, Love Ella; didn't love this CD: This was a very jazzy album and just seemed to try too hard. I know singers must get tired of singing the same type of songs
1, Something's happening here....: A haunting
0, Good as paper weight: Never been able to sync with computer
0, does not live up to promise: A cute book
0, More motivational than substantive: Although the book covers quite a bit in its 250-some pages
0, RCBS 130: I have not used it yet. I tried to balance the scale to zero
0, Worst movie ever: The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible. Save your money and order one of his later movies.
0, The 39 Steps: The VHS tape was inpossible to watch. I tried it on 2 different playback machines that were in perfect working condition and played other tapes just to see if the problem was in the machine or the tapes. I found that the problem was only with the 39 Steps
0, BE CAREFUL - ONLY BUY CRITERION EDITION: If you don't get the Criterion Edition
0, Deep: This is a very hard read
0, Ugggg...: I'm all for reading soul-searching materials
1, The Power in Metaphors: Estes has provided a great service to us all by preserving and interpreting these archetypal stories that pass on the wisdom of the generations that precede us with regard to living
1, Beloved: I read the book first
0, Prysock vs. Harvey: I ended up here because I was trying to see if Laurence Harvey's version of This Is My Beloved is available on CD. Alas
1, great for what i do: This toy is great for customization as well as overall playing... I'm actually going to get another one just so I can customize an Ice cream van out of it... I recommend getting this if you customize toys... or as a gift for your kids
1, Standard Breakfast: I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling
1, Good Stuff: It was because of the other graphic novel based in Arkham Asylum that I heard of this one. Sure enough
1, Almost perfect Batman book: From the start I was enthralled. The art
0, should have gone with another flavor: DId not like the chocolate oatmeal raisin. wasnt very tasty. It is filling and wholesome but I would not buy again at this price.
0, Not worth watching--nothing Keaton put out really is and maybe never was: Like so many of Keaton's films it is more fun to wish you could watch them than it is to actually tune in.This film has one novelty only--the ship looks expensive. Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set). Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster?
1, it works: what more do you need to know. Only 4 Stars because the unit responds a bit slowly to the remote control
1, Three women reflect on sandplay: If you've wondered what sandplay was all about from a Kalffian/Jungian perspective
0, Good product bad deal: this is being sold for 5-8 dollars on most of the internet. word to the wise
0, Didnt work for me: I used the pest control product for cloth moths. I placed several of these around my house
0, DOES NOT WORK
1, Safer pantry pest trap: After buying these traps in a local hardware store
0, Safer moth traps no longer work: I had been using Pantry Pest traps successfully for years. Recent purchases haven't worked at all! I will not buy them again.
0, Safer Pantry Pest Trap: I was unimpressed by this product. When I put this product out on my counter
1, Works but don't depend on it to rid the moths: We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap
0, Did not do the job: The Pantry Pest did not work. The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths!! I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap--nothing! It bounced off them like it was super moth!! The lure is tiny and did not attract many moths. I would try other things first before buying this.
0, This product does not seem to be working!: I picked this product up at my local Ace Hardware store. I had high hopes for these traps
1, Pantry moths and larvae: Found product to be effective. However
1, So far
0, A dancer: Based on the reviews that were available last year
1," Nina the Torch Chanteuse--Highly Recommended: Nina's voice is like no other vocalist--the emotional intensity she brings to her covers and originals are non-pareleil. This ""After Hours"" CD (formerly on Philips"
0," If only I could vote ""0 Stars"": I am continually disappointed in Boy George. He has such potential"
0, I don't know anyone in this book!: Ok
1, mexican way: Well
0, Not DTS
0, could have been better: THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF
1, Please
1, I blurted out laughing so many times!! Mama Ruby is Madea: The narrator did such a fantastic job with bringing all the characters to life. The book is off the hook! Terrifying and funny at the same time. The story is crazy and makes me think about history. I sure hope people didn't live like this for real but I am sure they did. Mama Ruby thinks that satan is a low down
1, Pam's Opinion on The Upper Room: I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my 1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend.
1, **** EXCELLENT PAGE TURNER******: This book was so captivating!!! It kept my attention right from the start. I could not put the book down! I stayed up late at night and had to force myself to put it down
0, Returned. Way too specific for my needs.: I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a 12 week program. I'm a school counselor
0, Smiley
1, maximum WHO: In my opinion
1, Bag It
1, BRAVO! CHER!: This is one DVD you'll want to watch over and over again.As a child I grew up listening to Sonny & CHER.The songs from the 60's brought back memories
1, We don't have Cher in Brazil: In fact
1, That's just how it is: I had a lot of fun seeing myself in many cartoons
0, Cheap
0, Buy it from a department store: The La Mer Concentrate is great... but it doesn't cost anywhere near this much. Even Neimans sells it for less.
0, Misleading: This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description. You have to take the phone out of the case to do that. The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though. Good thing it was cheap. I bought other things from them that worked out really well.
1, Can't wait for his next book...: I'm a little late getting to read this wonderful book
1, Wrong color sent: The item itself is very good; however
1, Not too seriously: This is a great book for lover's of vocabulary. As you can infer from the title
1, A great book about a great pitcher!: I have almost no earthly idea why this book is out of print. It is one of the best books I've ever read. When I was in fifth grade
1, Dying to have known DVD (Gerson Therapy): The Gerson Therapy represents the courage and unselfishness of one man
0, Great service but . . .: the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape. That information should have been stated in the description.
1, Excellent analysis of Knowledge Management: Ms. Dixon does an excellent job of describing knowledge management and its role in making an organization more successful. Through the various models she builds
0, What an unpleasant surprise ...: Yes the concept of the book
0, Why Isn't The 2009 Anniversary Edition Widescreen Format???: The old Dvd from 2001/2003/2005 (whichever!) states its Widescreen Format(1:85.1) with a Running Time of 93 min and Rated-R.The 2009 reissue DVD says its full frame with a Running Time of 91 mins and Unrated. (???)I'm glad that this release date got pushed back until January 2010 so that maybe I'll just cancel the new reissue order that I placed
1, good slasher: instead of the lack of creativity that most slashers have this film is good. the style is wonderful and the charecters are real. they really got good actors for this movie. has lots of twists and you can tell where i know what you did last summer got there idea. the film had some scary parts. i would recomend this.
1, It's the greatest book about AST I've ever read !: There's everything about breed history
1, One of the best movies of all time: If you haven't seen CASABLANCA
0, Did not know it did not download to your device.: Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased. I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.
0, Casablanca: My disc is bad; It would not get past the 8th scene. I probably need to buy a new one --from somewhere else.
1, Great movie!: This movie is a must-see for folks of all ages! I can't believe I had never seen it before. Wonderful love story.
1, Great film
1, A movie fan's dream..film noir and romance combined.: What is striking about the movie first is its setting: The waystation between Nazi Europe and America. The characterization is excellent. Bogart and Bergman play opposite each other extremely well
0, How should I put this?: I hate this movie. Its not even a movie
0, If you love this film
1, Casablanca: A marvelous movie with all the foreign intrigue you could want.A true love story wrecked by war.The movie worked very well and I feel great about this purchase.
1, I Bought this as a gift: I got this for my Father
0, fornication: same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust
1, Love this movie: I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up. It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone
1," A Package of Nostalgia: What a wonderful gift! A numbered souvenir box containing ""Casablanca"" on 3 DVD's"
1, Fantastic old movie!: I rented Casablanca as I hadn't seen it in years. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight. It was great!
1, Hookah: The hookah is great. The delivery was fast and the company was very helpful. They called and explained the various tobaccos and helped me pick some out.
1, I Love Steve Coogan...: and this was another jewel. Many of Coogan's characters aren't that familiar to U.S. audiences so this was a trove of unexpected fun. Hope I can see him live and in person someday.
1, beyound the sea of ice: a very interesting book that follows a simular theam to Auel but is much more exciting and with less romance
1," Best Illustration book I could ever wish for..: ""Creative Illustration"" is an amazing book. It is extremely useful"
1, Grill skillet: This is a great item to stir fry of vegetables or shrimp over the grill. I love the detachable handle which makes it easy to take the skillet off and on when using on the grill. The pan cleans up easily.
0, did not work: product did not work. wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it wouldn't charge the device either
1, Pretty
0," Too much revenge.: Not much of a story. There is sympathy for the main character but too much repetition of the hurdles involved. At times the ""revenge"" theme just isn't enough of a story"
0, Not worth buying: If you are a thinking person
1, Excellent Album: This is an excellent album
0, Not a bit of freshness to Horace Silver's masterwork!: Musical projects based on singing lyrics to jazz standards are not to my taste. Just because they usually do not add a least bit of motivation and artistry to the original instrumentals. Horace Silver is a particular victim of that situation. In other words
0, Offset dialog screens: Story and picture quality aside
1, Great wave board: My grandchildren asked me to order this for them to give as a surprise to their mother who
1, very fun: I bought this for my 10 year old for his birthday - it was too big for him
0, fun
0, Cheap Plastic that Cracks from normal use: I bought one of these several years ago. I was riding it within a few minutes. I am an adult (under 200 lbs) and don't do anything fancy with it. I noticed after riding on occasion over a few weeks that small hairline cracks started forming on both platforms where the torsion bar inters the plastic. This is not properly engineered and I would guess that someone doing tricks on this board could easily break the plastic.
1," GIVES PEACE OF MIND: I am very happy with this product as it gives me assurance and peace of mind that all of my photos will last (at least) my lifetime on these discs (or so they promise). It has been difficult for me to locate any ""archival"" quality discs in local stores. Once I found out that other (cheaper/regular) discs may lose data over time"
1," Learning can be fun!: I purchased this for my 4 year old when she started telling me she wanted to learn how to ""tie shoes like a big girl"". She was excited to start as soon as we received the book"
1," Where to purchase this book (and PDF) online...: This book (under the name ""MMURTL V1.0"") can be found on Sensory Publishing's website:http://www.sensorypublishing.com/mmurtl.htmlYou can purchase a PDF of the book (and the source of the OS itself)"
1, So well written
1, Loki does it again: I've recently downloaded the demo. It contains the first 2 maps of the windows version (which I also own). The gameplay is great! I'm using Linux X4 with a 3D Prophet GTS 2
1, Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge: This is the first time that I have used the Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge in my Canon PC (E-40). The price was reasonable and I am satisfied with the quality of copies that I have made so far. I recommend this brand for routine copying. I have no complaints and intend to purchase it again!!!
0, Suck(s): Don't waste your money. This movie Sucks. Iggy and Alice
0, Directions are AWFUL: Ordered this based on the product name. The directions are horrendous and make no sense. It is cheaply made and I had to rig it up in order to have the basket sit on the side of the pan as they said.. I would NOT recommend this item!!
0, Pretty but lame: This unit performs well while it lasts
1, Really worth the price: This cute discman manufactured by Koss have a 40 sec memory for the hard bus time. The overall sound quality is ok and there's a bass boost option that work very well. Beside the cool design
0, KOSS is a terrible CD player: KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul. BUT THEY DON'T! Trust me
1, Great CD Player!: This CD player is great! IT looks cool
0, 1 pen
1, One of my favorite movies: I love action comedy flicks
1, An excellant book for all ages and nationalities: I love reading it
1, Great IS and Bokeh: With this lens
0, A Solid Lens with drawbacks: This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one
1, The Canon EF 70-300 mm IS is a GREAT lens for the price!!: Bought this lens a few months ago and have been very happy with all the photos since. I don't think you can take a bad picture with this lens. I've taken everything from drag racing pictures of dragsters going 320 MPH
1, great: i feel like paparazzi
1, Awesome Lens Great Price!!: I had the 70-200 L F/4 usm without the IS
1, Great lens: Thrilled to see the price drop and I'd been waiting for the telephoto lens for awhile. I weighed the pros and cons of getting this one for my Canon 40d vs an L series lens but decided in the end that this would do nicely in the meantime. I took some excellent shots through my kitchen window of some baby birds and was very pleased with the detail.
0, Over priced...: This lens sells new at Best Buy for $500+
1," Makes Guero look thin....: ...and I gave Guero 5 stars. Beck does it again. DVD is awesome as well. Of all the ""keepers of real"""
0, a mulligan: Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project
0, Cumbersome and cheap: Forget this camera. After owning several digital camera's over the years and knowing how to operate them after only a couple of days it takes constant programming for every picture you take in order to get a good photo. This is not the camera for just grabbing and taking a photo. It requires thought and total concentration to just get an acceptable photo. I'd buy an off the shelf Kodak from Kmart before buying this one again.
0, The Camera that wasn't: I cannot review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me. Nor has my money been returned. I am very disgusted with the whole business. It's too bad. It looked like a good camera.
0, worst movie ever!!!!!!: don't waste your money one of the worst movies I have ever seen no plot
1, Too Large: I had to return this card because it wouldn't fit in the available computer space. So I really did not have a chance to use it. I have an HP 8760C. The card is about 10 inches long. So just make sure you measure the available space.
1, Better than the original: It pains me to say that. But these instrumentals are much better than the versions with vocals. Sorry dude
0, Good Product money wise but not Safe: I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser 
1, Very
1, Like the mat
1, Very pleased: The process was very quick and easy. My book arrived quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition.
1, Victims No Longer: This is an excellent book. I am a counselor and the issues addressed regarding male child sexual abuse are so important. So many males have been molested and/or incested and carry shame
0, Unsatisfied: I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you. The item frequently freezes and stops
1, A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!: Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one
1, gone with the wind: One of my all time favorite books
0," A wannabe ""War & Peace."": Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism"
1, The Best Book Ever: My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil
1, Used but Good Book: The copy is a 1940's print
0, It didn't work and spoilt my coffee maker as well: Well
1, great gift for soon-to-be moms: I bought this and a few other Bella B items for my sister-in-law who is expecting; she loves all of the products.
0, .: This book was just not for me. I don't see the sun let alone the beach...that should have been my first clue.
0, Not for every taste.: I'm not into this eccentric approach of this major work. After having a long tradition of superb recordings of thissymphony by Karajan (1963)
0, Ended up not liking Bobby Fischer: I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.
1, A Good Sample: This is a good sample of swinging tunes Mulligan recorded with other top notch saxophonists. A nice blend of standards and Mulligan originals. The highlights are the Zoot Sims-Mulligan and Paul Desmond-Mulligan teams. Favorite tunes are 'Chelsea Bridge
1, THE 1.33:1 ASPECT RATIO WAS HOW IT WAS INTENDED: Some customers here
1, Great collection for a film buff !: Any time a Criterion Collection edition of a DVD comes out
1, One of the greats...: A cinematic giant
0, The template: Like many of Akira Kurosawas films this is a template for basic storytelling that has been referenced
1, A great story: There are many accolades and volumes of in depth analysis for this film
1, One of the top ten best films -EVER.: Not only one of the best Samurai films
1, Unforgettable: This is absolutely the best movie to be filmed. Ever. I have seen a ton of movies but this was the best. Even though it has a simple storyline
1, And you thought kids watch teen movies!: I first saw this movie on the action channel. I remembered it and bought it on a DVD. Me
1, The best movie ever made: This is the best film of Akira Kurosawa and the best film ever made. Citizen Kane is as good as this movie
1," Check the original aspect ratio nefore you complain...: I'm sick of all the people that complain ""Why isn't it in letterbox/widescreen?!! I can't believe they butchered it and put it in fullscreen!"" etc. It was shot in 1.33:1 ratio"
0, didnt like it.: didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful
0," One of the most boring movies ever!: I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't ""get"" them"
1, A Monument to the Writing Life: No cartoon series is followed more closely by writers than Peanuts and no dog understands writers better than Snoopy. Writers love the Snoopy cartoons but most writers will be amazed that there are so many of them. Now you can have a complete collection.Barnaby Conrad is the director of the Santa Barbara Writer's Conference. Charles Schulz drew huge crowds each time he spoke there.As an author
0, CAREFUL: Cheap
0, As a teacher
0, Disappointed: First of all
1, High on the list of movies that p**s off liberals: While this movie seems to flaunt its disregard for historical accuracy
1, Great for Travelers: I recently came back from a trip to Australia. Not only was this book invaluable for everyday communication
0, A Semi-Interesting Mess: The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading. Some terms were terribly out of date
1, Love it or Hate it
0, Not Believable: The book is unbelievable as in NOT believable. No way is it reality to beleive eight-year-old boys in Iowa
0, You have to love this book: When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say
0, Adobe InDesign CS2@work: This book would only suit a desktop publisher rather than a Prepress or Graphic Designer
1, This book is fantastic.: I have long wanted to cook Indian at home
1," The Last Trail: This is the last of a trilogy published in 1909 after ""Betty Zane"" (1903) and ""Spirit of the Border"" (1906). It's a historical novel set in the Ohio River Valley in the late 18th century shortly after The American Revolution. It focuses on two bordermen assigned to protect the settlement at Fort Henry. Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also"
0, not a novel: Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan. Instead I found a detailed and tedious history of tea. I gave up after a couple of hours.
0, Ok: Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages. Probably wouldn't buy again. To others though this could be their book.

0, McLaughlin leaves us waiting: I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful
1, This Novel Is What Great Writing Is All About!!: I recently finished reading this novel and fell in love with the characters
1," One of the 5 Greatest Novels Ever Written: Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is outstanding"
1," A ""boring masterpiece"": There were times"
1, Steinbeck goodness: This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone.
0, Plastic!: It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
1, I work here. Trust me. It's the best thing ever written.: I am a writer for the new National Lampoon that is launching in late September. There are only 3 of us here now
1, Please Reprint!: Will the world listen to the plea of thousands and reprint this masterpiece of 60's parody!!! I cannot face the future without seeing Ms. Armbruster one more time! Also
1, Go PATS!: Bought this for wife as a stocking stuffer. I'm sure she'll enjoy backing her team without taking up the whole window.
1, Classic: John Carpenter's Halloween tells the story of an escaped mental patient Michael Myers(Nick Castle)Michael was locked up for 15 years after he killed his sister.Dr.Loomis(Donald Pleasence) is on a frantic search for michael
0, Nowadays
1, The best! I had to watch the last of it with the lights on!!: This is my favorite movie of all time. It all begins when Lori (CURTIS) is babysitting 2 kids when psycho serial killer Michael Myers murders her friends and comes after her. I loved the ending and the rest of it. About half way through the movie
0, They Cropped out the Boobs: The movie speaks for itself. However
1, Absolutely Scary!: This would have to be one of the alltime scary movies.The roleof Michael Meyers steals the film. Meyers escapes from an insane asylum and returns home. His doctor played by Donald Pleasancegoes hunting for the evil Michael Myers. The villain of this movie starts killing the members of two groups of teenagers whoare celebrating Halloween.He is scary. After several killings by Meyers the movie comes to a conclusion. The doctor finally locates Meyers and shoots him several times blowing him off the balcony. The movie has a creepy ending with the supposedly killedMichael Myers nowhere to be found.The music at the end of the movie is absolutely creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of thebabysitter does an exceptional role. This is a must see movie. Buy it.
1, Best Slasher Film Ever!!: When a little six year old boy named Micheal Myers stabs his sister in cold blood to death
1, Best horror movie ive ever seen: If youre looking for a halloween movie to rent or buy then i definitely would go with halloween1. This is a great movie with plenty of violence and gore. It is interesting and exciting to watch. This movie should be every horror movie fan's favorite.
1, An absolute masterpiece of Terror!!!: This DVD
0, Oh
0, This sucks...: This is the worst movie of all time. I rented it once
1, Nice but not what i expected: i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
1, The Classic Horror Movie: The story deals with a character named Michael Myers
1, The Begining of the best Horror Series Ever!: Halloween is an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleansance did the best acting. This movie is very mysterious
1, A Must Have For Every Horror Buff: Halloween is a original and scary horror movie that deals with a disturbed male named Michael Myers that goes on a infamous mass murdering rampage in his hometown Haddonfield.
0, Poor DVD transfer: The transfer to DVD is very poor (worse I have seen yet). There are so many artifacts in the video as well as black portions of the letter box that is can be quite distracting. The movie is a great movie but save the dough and by it on VHS or see in when it is on cable.
0," ""Kane Hodder should have played Michael..."": Well"
0," Utterly Ridiculous: Anyone who thinks this is a ""definitive"" version or a ""director's cut"" is sadly misinformed. For the record"
1, Halloween Blu-Ray: I am grading this solely on the blu-ray quality since everyone and their dog has seen this movie and probably come to the conclusion that this is a horror classic if not the best horror movie of all time.The quality of of this blu-ray is great. They did a great job cleaning this up for blu-ray material. This blu-ray paired with my LG7600 Clearmotion technology made this movie look like it was filmed yesterday. This movie was not filmed in the best of conditions and the equipment and film was not very good
0, Where's the ending?: There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself
1, Grandmothers life: I liked the book because it gave me an idea what my grandmother's life might have been like. She came west in 1903 with her parents to homestead in Washington.
1, Look at life from one womens perspective.: Great look back to life at a slower pace when our country was younger. One womens recanting her life after a move to Wyoming to settle our land.
1, Letter from a Woman Homesteader: This was not my favorite book. I thought it was to simplistic. I received the book in a timely fashion and would consider buying from this seller again
0, lois: I read it for a book club. It was a Kindle free book. It was over priced. It was a waste of time.
1, Water wings: They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company
1, Great price
1, Very interesting: The book that I read was So. B. It by Sarah Weeks. This book is realistic fiction because it could really happen to someone.So. B. It is about a girl named Heidi. Her mom has something wrong with her
1, Excellent: I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it
1, Forgotten movie: I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember it from when I was just a kid. It was nice to have finally gotten my hands on it and been able to see it again. The movie was ahead of its time. The basic idea is a company starts using digital representations of real life models and no longer needs the real person anymore. This movie came out in the 1980's
1, A Good Story: My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller.
0, Redemption: As other readers have noted
1, This is a gripping epic that leaves one filled with emotion: This is one of the best books I have ever read
1, Superb collection of short stories about southern life.: After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness
1, Nice Fit: I bought this clutch hose for my old 95 Ford Probe. It fits perfectly and working great. This part is rare to find and I have tried different local auto part dealers but no luck. I then tried Amazon and found it. Great price!
0, A Student Perspective: As a student
1, Good Read: This is a good view of the triumpial entry and Christs lasts days on earth from the perspective of the high priests right hand man/jewish slave. He is asked to be apart of Christs arrest and is the man whose ear is cut off and healed. He of course is transformed into a follower and we see his journey and what's required of him from then on.We did his in book club
1, Doesn't get any better!: I had never read historical fiction until this
1, They are amazing: I can honestly say that I have never had the experience of the other reviewer
0, Don't bother: Interestingly enough
0, Short Lifespan: This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much.
0, Poorly crafted
0, it broke: I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke. I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions. While I was using it it did the job but not for long.
0, Complete piece of garbage: Purchased this item
1, Works like a charm...: This Chill Pad works great. Keeps my P4 notebook nice and cool. My notebook fan
1, Targus Chill Pad: Other than the powercord on my previous chill pad coming undone due to wear and tear
0, Stopped working after only 2 months of having it: I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct 16 2007 it stopped working. I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working.
0, Don't buy Targus products!!!: I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought. They last about 2 months before they stop working. Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off
0, Wobbly: Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it. Needed a second one
0, bad connection soon after purchase: The design for this is terrible. The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch
0, Didn't know it was so noisy.: It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy. I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan. It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan. If there's a different chill pad that's quieter
1, Cool Air From the Chill Pad: I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed. Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler. I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much. I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration. If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance. You have to turn it off and then spin it back up. Overall a great deal for heat venting needs.
0, Horrible!: I orderd this chill pad in May. Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August. it has abruptly stopped working as of last night! Piece of garbage..........
1, useful product: Pros:-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk
0, worked for a week: it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable. I have yet to find a chill pad that works well. I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
0, bad connection: I own two of these laptop coolers. Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops. Both have the same problem. After about one month of use
0, OKay but not long lasting and loud: I purchased this from Staples a few months back. It worked okay
0, Power Cord issues after a few months: This fan was easy to setup and use. It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p. But
0, WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER!!: I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart. This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year. Every one I have had has died within 4 months. So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one
0, actual product model delivered is not of the pictured shown on amazon: I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller. seller needs to update the image. chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy. the fan noise can become annoying over time. I would not recommend this model.
0, The USB cable is a piece of crap: The pad cools better than nothing
0, Cheap quality: Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot
0, better than nothing@: This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook. However
0, POS - and that does not mean point of sale!!: This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can. Fans are in the center
0, Decent while it lasts: The pad ran quietly
0, Great for first 3 months....then quit working.: This was a great cooler out of the box
0, Plastic and cheap: I received a different chill pad than the one pictured. It is a very undurable plastic
0, Didnt get the one in the main picture!!!!: Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture. I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle. Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent. The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here. Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side. The one i got does not. So beware when u order this. U wont get the item that is in the main picture. Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead. Not happy!
0, Not what it seems: This product is not as show or described. It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand. The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands. However this model is super thin is low speed fans. There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans. The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use. I ordered two and regret it. Don't let the fake picture fool you
1, good book: Good information in the book
0, Disappointing device: I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a 15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid
0, FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great: I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however
1, best purchase: I purchased this camera just before a trip to New Zealand. I had two requirements wide angle and macro. This camera more than delivers. It was very easy to learn. The battery life was good I used a battery a day. I purchased a back up battery. I took over 2000 pictures. Thus the back up charged battery. The camera took awesome photos the zoom was a major bonus that I was not really after. Overall I highly recommend this camera and Amazon has the best price going. There are some bad pictures posted on here that I feel do not represent this camera. A camera is as good as the person pushing the button. I have never taken a class and I find this camera user friendly. You judge I have posted pics.
1, Very good camera.: I have used this camera for two vacations and many back yard pictures and am quite impressed with it's capabilities! It was a little hard to get used to because it has more complicated settings than our previous Kodak digital camera
0, Panasonic Lumix: While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light
0, Lacks quality great concept!: Im a photographer. I compared this head to head with My Canon S70. The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera. After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations. It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs 180 DPI with my Canon. The highest MB image it will take is 3.51. My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5.5 often. WHY is this important. Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion. It was sad. I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA 100 and used a tripod. Im sending it back
0, After 1 month pump does not work.: The pump does not work after 1 month of intermitent use. The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor. The motor is now locked up. Pump area is fine
1, This is a wonderful book: When I opened the package I was surprised that this book was so big. I was expecting something a lot smaller. Then when I started reading I was surprised that it held my attention as long as it did. Some of the items take up a page or two
1, Very
1, Golly.: Showy and theatrical makes women swoon and men's chests swell lush breathless passionate no-holds-barred romance more powerful than any film soundtrack. Above the keyboard
0, Perfect in the beginning
1, power washer: For the home owner it does what ever you need at 1750 psi. My last one was gas @ 2500psi. This electric washer is a no brainer. Easy operation and at 1750 psi can still do damage to wood if not carful.
0, Really inappropriate: I don't like this film and because of it
0, Sex and nudity in the city of gambling: This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
1, Elizabeth Berkley is a babe!: Having been a fan of Elizabeth Berkley long before this movie was made
1, A big slice of cheesecake: Elizabeth Berkley stars as a hooker who wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl...only to find out it's not as glamourous as she anticipated. All I can say is
1, hey hey hey what is going on here?: first of all laugh all you want but i actually thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.i do think that gina gershon played her part really well.i also think she could have played elizabeth berkley's role too.i thought the movie was way better than striptease.i've seen both the r-rated and nc-17 versions and i saw no difference.i also didn't see much reason to rate it nc-17 either.the funny thing was i was sitting there thinking to myself
1, Highly Underrated
0, TRASHY: Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
0, This is by Thrustmaster!?: Totally disappointing. The dead space is unbelievably large and the 8-directional button keeps misinterpreting input strokes. Can't believe this junk has the Thrustmaster name on it. The wheel is cheap plastic construction and has a very flimsy feeling. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
0, Arcade OK
1, Good But with a few flaws: This wheel is really good. The only major flaws are that when you change racing games you may need to change the sensitivity of the wheel. I was really looking foward to having a realistic gear shifter but it only shifts up and down which makes it good for the games like cell damage but not so realistic for games like project gotham racing. The foot pedals are great and i recomend you get this game wheel.
1, A Tragic story: As one of the characters in the book
1, A True Account of Lethal Deception for Profit: The author Andrew Schneider tells the story of uncovering a scandal of major proportions. It is a frightening
1, Pioneer Families of eastern and southeatern Kentucky: My wife thought this book was a great book of info to help with her research. Wll look to purchase more books on the subject.
1, Unparalled story craftmanship: I have just finished this book. It was a delight. Uncle Remus is one of the most alive characters ever to be portrayed in literature. Now
0, Low Quality Filter: The white filter has an inferior quality to the one that came originally with the machine. It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time. That did not happen to the original one even when I washed again and again. I wonder if the replacement is fake.
0, Beware-- shipping ruins these planters.: I bought these planters because I had owned them before and they were very durable and attractive. I especially liked the high-gloss look. Unfortunately
0," Okay: ""Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2"" was an okay film"
0, Easily the worst movie ever!: Blasting in my right eardrum

1, Neanderthal Man: I gave one to my 14 yr. old grandson who has AD/HD. He loves to take things apart and usually keeps me on edge when he comes for a visit. However
0, Item is Not as Described!: I ordered two of these pans. One for myself and one for my sister. We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior. The pans we received were from the MC2 collection. Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan. So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one. We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware. I am very dissapointed. Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan.
0, One of my least favorite Nora books......: Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end
0, Old and Tired: This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development
0," Dorf: I did not review ""Dorf Goes Fishing"" however I did See the Complete Dorf Set. I did not find it funny. Even as much as I enjoy the comedy of Tim Conway. Probably would not recommend this title."
0, Not Socrates Cafe.: The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend 15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise.
0, Do Not Buy: I wasted money on four packs
0, Waste of money: This makes for a good late night HBO movie when you are bored. Not worth the money spent to own 
0, A ridiculous waste of paper!: I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN'S GRAVE
1, Even an avid suspense fan won't foresee the surprise ending!: When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel
0, What is on the tape?: It is hard to know if you want to buy an item when the descriptioin does not include what movies are on the tape?Could someone post that info?I'll rate it higher when I know what it is?Phillip
0, Disappointed: I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
0," Kind of junky: Not really worth $250... ""leaves"" are just cut from flat sheet-metal"

1, MARIETH DAVILA.: ENRIQUE TE FELICITO LA CANCION ES MUY BUENA
1, Bailamos: Me gusta mucho: Great music! Does anyone have any idea how I can obtain the lyrics to all the songs on Bailamos?
1, Great: I love this song but I would really like to get ahold of the words
0," The names of this book's reviewers seem fake ...: ""Warren Buffet"""

1, Terrific
0, Many Miles Away..a tribute to The Police: Some things are better left untouched. And this is the case with this cd.Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink. I can't believe someone would release this to the public. Not a single track on this cd is worth anything.Next time leave it alone...The Police are the masters and you people are still in kindergarten.
1, Tells you what it really means to let go!: This book tells you what it really means to let go and what happens if you truly let go. Many times we think we have let go of something in our heads but we are just in denial. Our heart has not really let go. This book has helped me overcome some of the most painful experiences in my life. If you want to really understand what letting go means
0, Ok: Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted.
1, Life doesn't always go as we want. This might help.: Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless
0, The worst proofed book in the universe: This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review
0, BORING: every teenage girl should watch this before her first datebefore going to makeout lane don't forget yor diaphramgirlfriend
1," Good educational supplement: My 3rd grade special needs child enjoys reading these stories and the reinforcement of the ""dot pen"" with its lights and noise is a lot of fun for him when he has to work on the reading comprehension questions. The downside is that the stories range from 1st to high 5th level (guide marks each story). I would prefer to have a box of stories with less range (maybe just 1-2nd then another box of just 3-4) but we're using these and will continue."
0, Cheaper Than It Looks - Cheaper Than It Costs: The product looks nicer online than it does in person. When I opened the box

1, Beautiful and Practical: This is a beautiful
1, I'll Be Watching You: I loved this book...it kept you guessing right up to the end. Very fast paced and exciting. I have really enjoyed all of Andrea Kane's books. You get involved with the story and almost feel like you're there. I hope she keeps writing a lot more.
1, Absolutely essential to your collection!: I used to have this recording on vynal. I got rid of it when I converted to CD's only. Needless to say I did not hesitate to spend the $25.00 to have it again but on CD. VERY good listening. Some of my closest friends were skeptical
1, Very good value and performance!: This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 6 1/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
0, ?????This Game is confusing and stupid?????: This game is confusing and stupid!! It is hard to find out what each butten means but please use your money wisely and dont get this game!!!!! Get Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
1, Great Game: This game is a great game! You learn about the economy as well as build what some people think is great. It is true that the tutorial does not finish but this still is a great game. I highly recommend this game
1, I would give it five
0, Not worth my time: Despite its colorful vocabulary
1, Great for different types of beds: I have a weird shaped bed that means I can't use most bed skirts so this was great. It wraps around my bed frame perfectly and looks very nice. The only problem is
0, DUST RUFFLE: Nice material. Well made but way way too short unless your looking for a 10 inch drop don't bother. Way way too short...also can't return because Brown's Linens enclosed a letter that said 10% re-stocking fee
1, The dark side of the river is revealed.: Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs
0, Needs better editing- mistakes found: The judges for our trivia contest used this book as the arbiter for disputed questions tonight
0, Give me a break!: Kiss have more compliation albums than I have had hot dinners. This is just a rehash of other compliation albums. Nothing new here. Double Platinum is far better
0, Kiss it Off: If you're a die hard Kiss fan
0, POOR SOUND: I HAVE ALREADY SENT THE T.V. BACK TO TOSHIBA TO HAVE THE VOLUMN REPAIRED
0, Not all that great...: I finished this in one day. It is that easy a read. Its got a virtually non-existant plot. The characters are also rather flat and unrealistic. It does try to have some humour here and there
1, Gift of the Red Bird: Very inspirational. I was totally filled with the Holy Spirit. I think I would like to go on a retreat like that. We have so much to learn. Please try it.

1, Another Great Novel by Peter David: Great story
0, Disappointed: I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them. I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit. My daughter is 5 and wears a size 12-13 shoe. The package says 4+ but I think it should say 4 and under. Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it. I guess I will see about returning.
0, Ruby Slippers Shoe Covers: I was very unhappy with my purchase! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt; I should have went with the majority! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first 15 minutes! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes! Not worth the money! :(
0, Cute but Not durable: The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place. The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage. As they began to dance the shoe cover came off. They are cute but good for dress up only.
0, Formulative: That's actually more of a 2.5 than a 2
1, human growth master mind group: This collection of works by the various authors offers the listener an opportunity to have an easily accessed master mind group in the field of human growth. The morning commute's blahs are a thing of the past when the driver plugs in a tape or cd and visits with the likes of Jack Canfield
1, I just love it.: I just love this cd.I like every one of the songs but
1, sultry...blissful...awesome: I've been a long time fan of Mazzy Star
0," Useless don't waste your money: No material of substance. Don't waste your time or money. Look somewhere else. ""The Idea Hunter"" by Andy Boynton is a better book."
0, O'really..: The contents' probably great
0," VERY MISLEADING!!!!: I just ordered this item and no where does it state that the dvd is missing it specifically notes that it is a blu ray & dvd combo pack as well as on the front it has where it said ""blu ray +dvd"" the +dvd is taken out. It should just say Blu ray since i got this so my daughter is able to watch it in our car as well in the house...which now i cannot"
0, Some inappropriate moments for family viewing: There are a few inappropriate scenes in the film
1, Adorable movie you'll be surprised how much you love!: I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie with my kids and husband. It was adorable! And it was updated
0, Horrible movie!: Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!
1, Gnomep & Juliet was GREAT!!: The movies arrived promptly and was in great working condition!!! The movie was very funny and I cried at the end.
1, Volume 3: It's good to see the characters in a different setting. Rowan Atkisson plays a very different part in each of the four seasons. Great take on how to develop a series.
1, Brilliant Rowan Atkinson: I positively LOVE British comedy... Benny Hill
1," where did it go: i know this album had the bonus-cut ""its a man's pride"" or ""man's pride"" where can i find it? that song should be in his top five"
0, Driller Killer: How horrible! I waited years to see this (it's only now allowed to be seen in Britain again) and was so dissapointed. Let's face it..Abel Ferrara movies are crap..he's probably the most over-rated independent director around and Bad Lieutenant his most over-rated movie. The only films of his worth seeing are Ms 45 and Dangerous Games (only because it's the only film ever that Madonna acts well in). Budget restrictions aside
0, Moto-X: Lets see I really dont like the game at all
1, Great reference: I have a 30 year old version of this book that my mother used in college. If you want to know how to integrate any weird function
0, Huge pills impossible to swallow: I have never had trouble swallowing pills. I can even swallow 4 normal sized pills at a time. But I can't even swallow one of these pills they are so huge. They don't even fit in a pill cutter! It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat. My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful. I even tried cutting one in half
0, I didn't receive the product ....: I bought the product but I didn't receive the product. The vendor service was bad.
0, William J. Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home: Not a bad book and it might be just what you're looking for. 300 pages
1, Jimmie Johnson Cooler: This cooler goes everywhere with me. It has a great design with a front pocket. It is large enough to fit several smaller glad wear containers or 6 cans of soda.
0, Not the same color as on the detail page!: So disappointed and will be returning this. The color of the product on the detail page is an elegant dark-grey with a smattering of green
1, A Glowing reiview of a classic band.: This album typifies the sound of the late 70's post-punk scene in England. The sound is tight

0, Was sent a used item: The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously. There are scratches along the sides
0, Good-looking but poor performance: We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote didn't work
0, Great idea
0, Expensive Piece Of Junk!!: I was actually able to convert some vinyl to digital
0, crosley crap: I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear. and the tapes were clear
0, Junk-Save Your Money: This player was a Christmas gift that was opened Christmas morning. The player had a bunch of screws or something rolling around inside the sealed player when we took it out of the box. There was a larger component rolling around inside the player also. Must have been where the screws came from. We still tried out the player hoping that we would not have an electrical blow-out when we plugged it in because of the components rolling around inside the player. It seemed to work ok. We returned it for a full refund.This item was very cheaply made and for the money they are asking for it it is not worth it. Do not go by the pictures because the one I received did not look like the same wood color. And thats because it is not real wood.I am not sure where this was made but it is typical of the junk that is being made in China these days. When I was a kid this kind of junk was being made in Japan.My advice...stay away.
0," Crosley recoreders are junk ""DO NOT BUY THEM"": I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it (3) times and the cassette player quit working...sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work....just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button doesn't work you have to use the remote control only to use it....junk"
0, CROSLEY CR248 SONGWRITER CD RECORDER: THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. 
1, Very funny movie: This movie was great it was hysterically funny and is no more tasteless and vulgar than low brow movies that have come out since this
0, What's the Big Deal?: With all the hype
1," The funniest movie I have ever seen!: I am very skeptical of comedy. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The American mass-media concept of what is ""funny"" rarely"
1, Great for those who understand the comedy: I have read all of the other comments and laghed along with the great comments but was a little upset with the one raters. In this movie you have to understand the comedy.. not that you have to be a teen but the comedy is not for your average person. It's for the people that like outrageous unusual comedy like the scene with the dog or witht the hair gel. And the story is great too especially the end where all the guys who like her are in her house. It is SO FUNNY! If you know what comedy is.. you'll enjoy this!!!!
0, What an appalling movie !: I listened to the hype but borrowed the DVD before I bought it. I am so glad I did - one of the worst films I've seen in ages. The whole theme of guys trying to get their leg over is far better done in Notting Hill. There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well
1, Loved it: I love the idea of a bunch of guys being in love with the same woman
0, Cat: If you can read and/or spell the word above
1, I have never laughed so hard at any movie.: If you haven't seen it
0, What a stupid movie!: This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid. If you want to see a movie that's more funnier go rent American Pie that movie's hilarious. Stay far away from this movie it's dumb!
0, Funny.: The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot.The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story.But the funny are very great I really laugh.
0, There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!: This movie starts out with a lot of promise
0, What are they thinking??: I hate it when they don't create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy! Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this??!?! It's just plain lazy. Don't bother buying
0, There's nothing about mary....: I only gave this movie 1 star because you can't give negative stars. This movie is painfull to watch
1, Classic: Who doesn't love a classic? The only thing I missed were the pictures
1, A classic tale with Amazingly beautiful artwork: My son constantly wants me to read this book to him. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is a classic. I'm sure this book will become a family heirloom.

0, Text without pictures.: This edition includes just text
0, Poor quality: I was greatly disappointed with this item. Nearly every page was torn. Some drawn on & some had tape over the pictures. I bought this as a gift and I am hugely disappointed. The book couldn't even function.
0, Book's animotion is barely viewable.: The animotion is very dark and can barely be seen. It totally ruins the book. I will not be able to use it. It would have worked better to just had regular pictures.
0, Don't buy it for the pictures... there aren't any!: I was looking for this title to share with my first grade class
1, Great book: My kids found this book very beautiful. The illustrations are amazing too. We definitely will read this book as often as we could!

1, AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FROM HEAVEN: I can't explain the timeless quality of this album...themagic created by songwriters David Holster and Suzanne Paris
1, Pretty Cool: Although this wasn't one of my favorite books in the story it was still informative. Rand goes is STILL in the Aiel Waste which is tiring
1, Wheel of Time keeps on turning
1, A good book but Jordan is starting to slip.: I thought The Fires of Heaven was a good book. But Jordan is starting to slip. It seems that Jordan is repeating himself. But when I finished this book it seemed to me that the six book was going to be better.
1, TFOH-- two thumbs up: I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done
1, Great series: These books have well developed characters and plot lines that remind me a bit of the Game of Thrones series.
1, A step up from Shadow Rising: After a couple of chapters to set the stage
1, Much improved: 'The Fires of Heaven' is much

0, terrible adaptation of.........: a very good book. Much like Bonfire of the Vanities
1, Ideas for Language Arts Instruction: Ideas and Insights: Language Arts in the Elementary School is an excellent book every educator teaching at the elementary level should own. This book focuses on the whole language approach to teaching elementary language arts. It connects classroom practices with the theory that undelies them.Moreover
1, New insight: This book offers an interesting insight into the writer Vasily Grossman and contains a fine selection of some of his best writings during the war. A worthy publication that brings an important writer to life.
1," A real suprise find at my public library: Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was ""human"" in his writing"
0, The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your 18 wheeler!: I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
0, good for 101 courses
0, Gagged: I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher
1, My second favourite Vonnegut!: Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far
1, Awesome. And so on.: I found this book thought provoking and hilarious. I really enjoy the writers easy style. The character development was excellent. All these parallel lives summing into one big crazy soup.
0, A Waste of Time: Breakfast of Champions is the first Kurt Vonnegut I've read. I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point
1, Vonnegut's funniest book: It would be hard to describe the plot of this book. I've read it more than 5 times and I cannot explain it. Something about a transvestite guy named Harry LeSabre who sells cars
1, A Giddy
0, Mixing totally different languages and cultures: Baltic countries has distinct difference from Slavic cultures and languages
0, I didn't like it.: I just didn't know what I was getting. I don't like this one. I didn't even watch all of them. The first one was so bad.
1, Best sub drama of all times: This movie is the best sub movie of all times. Sean Connery plays Captian marko Ramius who intends to defect. Alec Baldiwn plays CIA agent Jack Ryan who goes on the hunt for the Red October. Finnaly Scott Glenn gives an excellent secondry perfomence as Capt. Mancuso of the USS dallas. All in all this is a great movie for any one who likes sub movies.
1," Absolutely wonderful!: ""The Hunt for Red October"" is an absolutely great adaptation of one of the best novels ever written. The producer's of this movie took Tom Clancy's masterpiece and made one of the best military action movies ever. While they didn't stick to the novel perfectly"
0, Do NOT buy from this seller!: I ordered a video tape from this seller about six weeks ago
0, Terrible Picture Quality: This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing. It looks like a used VCR tape that has been watched many many times. Don't waste your money on this one.
0, Horrible Video Quality: I love the Hunt for Red October and the makers of the DVD did it a horrible injustice. The video quality is horrible. I tend to buy DVDs for the enhanced video quality
0, Film 5 stars
1, Exciting!: An excellent portrayal of intelligence and cunning by Sean Connery. The movie is both exciting and thought provoking
0, Do not buy this!: Great movie (as we all know) but the BluRay edition if horrible. We can barely make out the audio even with the TV turned up double the volume. Save your money!

1, Monster Book: Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
1, Space by Andrew Chaikin: This is a coffee table size book with many spectacular photos from space and from other aspects of the Space Program. Andrew Chaikin has don his usual marvelous job with this book. It is even more than I expected and it was received in new condition on a timely basis. I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books.

1, DVD Elvis Thats The Way It Is: I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus 15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers
1, Disappointing: The background music is not clear and the CD was a waste of money. One star is too high.
0, Pretentious and Too self-involved.: I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character

1, Captain Jack's woman: This is the pivotal novel of Laurens' Cynster series & Bastion Club series. For those unfamiliar with Mz Laurens' writting
0, weak effort: The book starts well
0, Poorly written and ill-organised: This could have been a very good book but the author seems to suffer from an inability to identify with an audience that doesn't already know the material.The material is all there and if you struggle through it you can find alot of useful insights...but more times than not the struggle isn't worth it. I can't suggest getting it unless you feel compelled to collect books on Apache or are in desperate need of more documentation.
0, Online docs will do...: I bought this book
0, Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice.: This book is definitely a poor read. I got It because I thought the second edition would be a better read. These guys need to learn how to write and organize their thoughts better. There are other books that I'll buy over this one. The trick is to make it simple and have good flow; even the choice for the website (butter*) sucks. This review comes from a guy majoring in computer science.
0, Only a synopsis of info already out there: I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact
0, It's all uphill from here.: Usually purchasing an O'Reilly book on any topic is a virtual guarantee of excellence. This book is a notable exception. There are many other Apache books available
0," I need something better: I did not like this book. I think you can do much better with another Apache book. The authors basically wrote a diary of setting up a webserver from start to finish. They seem board out of their mind and try to be funny ever once and a while. They copy the man pages word for word occasionally.I need something serious and authoritive where the authors are passionate about the subject like the authors in ""Unix Power Tools"" or ""Unix System Administration Handbook""Come on O'Reilly"
1, Somewhat helpful.: This was somewhat helpful in my study of vintage clothing. It is not as helpful for my needs as The Dictionary of Costume and Fashion.
0, Best of Bobby Rydell: After placing one order over a year earlier
0, rating Of 1 Not For Bobby Rydell But For This CD.: This cd is a remake by Bobby of his songs

1," Great Book But Buy the Infinity Reprint Instead: ""Saint Jack"" is a great urban fantasy but the other published book is superior to this edition. The new edition has a larger type font and so is easier to read and contains great drawings which this edition doesn't have. So you should buy that instead of this. I happen to have both books being a big fan of this particular author."

1, DVD: In a cardboard/plastic box. Mine came with the middle tab broken so the DVD is a little scratched from rattling around. Can't really complain for the price.
0, movie: Bought this item because it was a old time favorite from when I was a kid. Thought my son might enjoy it. Was shipped fast so I was happy with that. However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all. It looked as if it had been a poor copy of an original.
0, TERRIBLE job
0, nonononononononononononononono: I suppose most of you who are raving on haven't read the book. If you do you'll realise the movie is trash. It stops where the book actually begins! Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is 10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.
0, Zero stars. Please don't buy this.: I'm flabbergasted that they put the dumbed-down tv version of this movie on dvd and not the theatrical version. They took scenes out
1, Talk about a classic...this is definately one!: This movie is one you will want to watch over and over again. It is an 80's classic and has far outlived it's decade.
1, This book is good on what it hits.: But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS
0, Mesmerizingly Dull: If you have ever been cornered by an innkeeper or B & B owner whose life contains five minutes of interesting tidbits
1, Please book the 1st flight to Anguilla!: If you have had the good fortune to visit Anguilla this is 'must reading'--you'll want to savor every word
0, Never mind: I ordered this chandelier for a small bathroom. I was very pleased with it when it arrived
0, Too gaudy: Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room. It's cute but the larger plastic crystals are too big and so they all hang close together and overwhelm the overall look/feel of the light fixture making it entirely too gaudy and cheap looking. The same goes for the matching table lamp.
1, catchy story!!: at first i doubted it'd be like old-foggie style and really boring
1, Fantastic book - and more!: I love this book. I love this film. It is a rare gift to love both a book and the film made from it
0, The Princess Bride 1st (first) edition Text Only: I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it
1, I love this book!!: This is a book everyone can enjoy It has Action
1, The BEST book ever written!: I am 14 and this is my favorite book. It has everything a book should
1, Who are you people?: It's been some time since I read this book
1, That rare thing
1, An all-time favorite
0, For once
1, GREAT READ!: This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since 1997
0, I liked the real book
0, Not really...: I loved the princess bride. I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But
0, The Princess Bride by William Goldman: I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long
1, Book club: My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it
1, Always an adventure
1, Did the Trick: This book was a great help when I decided to take on the task of developing my company's database! It showed me all the tricks and tips that I needed to get the job done.
0, I don't know what shape person this is supposed to fit...: This jacket is basically just a windbreaker
1, Nice: Well made jacket. Rugged
0, Good songs but technically flawed recording.: While the 2 CD set contains some good songs
0, Too big
1, A tragic tale: This book will keep you awake all night. Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen.
0, A great book... in its time. Check out the 2nd edition.: This was a great book in its time. It helped introduce me to SCSI
1, great: The item came in excellent conditions
1, great movies: we have watched these over and over. this is a great movie and the price for both movies was so worth-it. these occassionally come on TV but with the disks we don't have to fuss with commercials and can rewind
1, Good movies: both like I remember them and good glad the I got them haven't seen in a long time
1, Even if you know how to write a Complier over the weekend...: and no one can teach you anything new
1, Great product! It is 614: I have been using GUM proxabrushes. it is very difficult to find in stores. I usually get them at Wal-Mart. But recently I don't have any luck at all. They always run out of it. I am very glad to find it here. It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart. Shipping is fast
1, Why make it from scratch??: I was a bit skeptical about a packet mix
1, A lot of fun: Another film that was showing in selected theaters only - not where I live!!!!! Couldn't wait to get this one after seeing a brief trailer. This movie was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the whole shabang. Easy to watch
1, could be cheaper: I like the .mac account
0, Forget the storage case: I bought this saw just to have a handy second saw in the garage. I figured the storage case would be handy
1, HTC PM7000 Portamate Miter Saw & Power Tool Work Center: Excellent product. Good value
1, AWESOME: This thing is sweet. I do however wish it was easier to get replacement parts (extra mounts for new stuff) you can pretty well only find stuff online for this brand. But overall it is great
0, Way to floral: I didn't like this fragrance its very strong and floral. It does last a long time if this is they type of scent you're into.
0, Clichéd: This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd
0," Paradise Lost: I am innately suspicious of films that were bombs that later develope cult followings which appears to be the case with ""Phantom of the Paradise"" after perusing all the 5 star reviews(?!). I enjoyed director Brian DePalma's earlier forays into comedy with ""Greetings"" and ""Hi"
1, Ready for something different ?: Phantom of the Paradise is a breath of fresh air. The first to give you split-screen and more is a classic love story. And good against bad. Root..Root...Root for the good guy. Hiss at the bad. Is it a nightmare or is it the music industry. Suprise: It's both.
1, High Quality Bag: I was looking for a small bag that I could use on day trips or hikes. I did not want a huge bag to keep all my lenses and accessories. This is perfect for my needs. I have a Konica Minolta 5D with a 28-75 f2.8 lens attached
1," This completes the Kindle ""Nuala Ann"" Collection!: I originally had to buy ""Irish Lace"" in a print edition because it was the one Greeley novel missing from the Kindle collection of ""Nuala Ann"" stories. I'm glad that the omission of this second novel in the series was finally corrected. It carries on from Nuala's arrival in Chicago at the end of ""Irish Gold"" until her engagement to Dermot Coyne prior to ""Irish Whiskey"". It's nice to have all twelve novels in the series available on my Kindle."
1," As good as ""Gold"": Continuing the saga from ""Irish Gold"
0, Junk: Optima battery is garbage.. mine failed in 2 years and optima wont honor warranty because I bought it from amazon.
1, awesome.: This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right
0, Viewer BEWARE! This is not a Horror Movie or even a good movie for that matter: My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover
0, Started interesting: It certainly doesn't lack a twist
1, Warming to the cause: After reading the first of this series I decided to jump straight into the second book and was glad I did. Following the various characters and their adventures without to much back-writing to introduce the characters for those who had not read book 1 was a great advantage to being able to follow the story into this second book. The story continues without too many new characters to hold up the continuity. And so the adventure continues.
1, Not as great but still very good: I was a little disappointed in the sequel
1, Jordan takes off: While I enjoyed the prequel
1, Roads To Koktebel was ANOTHER great Art House Film: I agree that the pace was slow
0, Lame: This movie drags on and on
0, Como arreglarlo: Esperaba mucho de este juego... lamentablemente cuando por fin llego venia con las 104 cartas.. de color verde!!!.. sin artefactos ni los otros decks...que lamentable que no pongan atención en esta manufactura... ahora tengo un juego inservible.. a la basura los 25 dlls
1, wonderful toy for preschoolers: My daughter just loves Little Leap - she considers him her friend. We spend hours playing with Little Leap. She has learned the alphabet and loves to sing along with Little Leap.She gets so excited when Little Leap asks her to pick the next letter and she gets it right. It is teaching her so many concepts relating to pre-reading. She is able to identify letters and is very proud of herself.Thank you for such a wonderful
0," Makes too much noise!: The sounds that the frog makes are very ""tinny"" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off"
1, This Diverter Draws Attention: This is THE best diverter -- primarily because it is the valve AND trim in one!! I will
0, What a disapointment :(: Didnt like this series at all ... cheap production very disapointed.... would send back if I could ....would cost me too much in postage ... dont buy :(
1, Vermeer's Genius Revealed To All: This was the most interesting treatment of art and artists that I've ever been exposed to. The various art experts that appeared in the film went into great detail about the techniques used by Vermeer to obtain his wonderful lighting effects even showing
0, A Great Disappointment: After looking forward to this recording with much fervor
1, WHAT?: These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers. This is not a greatest hits album. Why so few tracks over 2 cds? Roll With It
1, great shipper!: I had to purchase this book for my daughter's AP Biology class. The book was just as described. Excellent condition and everything included. I received the shipment promptly.
1, Out of Exile: A moving story of a life of the mind by one of Indonesia's seminal political thinkers and actors
1, Wife loves it... which makes me happy: Got this for my wife's Christmas gift last year. She loves it. It matches our other bedroom furniture too. I was impressed because it wasn't as cheaply made as some of the comps. I was hopeful the back would be decorative as well
0, Disappointing!: Although Juliette Binoche and William Hurt turn out imaginative perfomrances
0, Aikido is not a sport: Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training
1," A really good young song writter: My girlfriend and I went to go see Jessica Simpson in concert and Ryan opened up for her and everbody loved him. He played about five songs and all of them where great they had great song writting and the music was very catchy and he has a great voice I really like ""Shame On Me"" on the new album I cant wait til his CD comes out Ryan is going to be the next big thing look out for Ryan Cabrera and buy two of his CD one for home and one for the car."
0, meh just buy the whole album: which has 11 other songs just as good as this one. Just buying the single is a waste of money.
0, worthless: I was very displeased with this book. It is shallow bunch of trite
0, Yawn...: After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before
1, What are the critics thinking?: I don't know who wrote the reviews panning this book. I thought it was GREAT! The history was NOT inappropriate
0, Don't waste your time: Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story
0, How disappointed can a Book Club be?: Based on a review of this book
0, Dumb.: As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel
0, Silly story: I read it quickly and thankfully it was soon over.Not much to the story except to highlight how one teacher dealt with her midlife crisis.Sky61
1, Christmas Would Be Just Another Day without Brenda Lee!: This is a great CD. But of course all Brenda's are. If you aren't in the Christmas mood
1, Obsessed: After just one show of Dexter I was hooked! Every season seems to get more and more interesting. I love this season and this show!
1, Great series!: I bought the first 3 seasons for my son and ended up enjoying it too. I can't wait until the newest episode airs tonight.
1, Dexter Blu-Ray: I haven't watched it yet
1, The series that keeps you coming back for more!: We've been watching this from Season One to Season Seven. It's truly awesome. Every season just gets better. You'll love all seven seasons from beginning to end. Don't miss any of them.
1, The best TV show ever: I have seen both season 1 and season 2 of Dexter and just can't wait for the third one to come out on DVD as this is our prefered way to watch it because my husband and I become so hooked we can't wait a whole week for the next episode to come on. We would watch 5 or 6 episodes in one night.It is by far our favourite TV show full of suspence and twists.Highly reccomended to all.
1, Love Dexter: I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played
0, Just not getting it: Since many languages are based from the Latin
0, Broke my kindle.: In short
1, Tale of Two Cities - Baltimore / Indianapolis: This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd! I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense. On this viewing
0, ONLY 20 MIN LONG! NOT A REAL MOVIE: Full price for a 20 minute short? I feel ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the entire description
1, Overall Very Good: The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is great (except for Bergeron). Powerful story. Worth two bucks to rent on Youtube rentals.
1, fleece bone pillow: I love this pillow! I have had neck problems for years and this pillow has really been a lifesaver. It is so comfortable and has stopped me from waking with neck pain. I take it everywhere I go so I always get a good nights sleep. I would highly recoment this product to anyone but especially those with neck pain issues.
0, Uncomfortable: I was disappointed with this purchase. I had a neck-bone pillow for several years that was just wonderful. Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement. This one was much wider at the spot where you would place you neck. The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least. I would not recommend this to anyone. Wish I returned this the first day I got it.
0," The 8th Man episode is incomplete: I have fond memories of ""Tobor the 8th Man"" from the mid-60s and I wanted my 4-year-old son to experience the character. Since the quality of everything on this DVD is cr*p"
0, Customer service: Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx 11 months. I read some of the customer reviews and learned that I am not the only one that has experienced this issue. The reason for my submitting this review is to inform others of the outstanding response I received from customer service. They are shipping me a new item and have provided me with a return shipping label for the broken item. GREAT SERVICE!!!
1, An exciting ride!: I enjoyed the development of the novel and found that I could not put the book down. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels
1, Another winner: My kids LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. The whole family has learned something
0," Misleading material: I purchased this book after taking the 029 test. I can honestly say that the ""test questions"" in this book bear very little resemblance to the questions on the actual test. The questions on the test are complex and difficult (often taking more 4 screens to present)"
0, Uh uh
0, Big Let-Down: The whole idea of the book is fasinating; I bought it without any recommendations because it sounded interesting. I kept hoping there would be a wonderful ending to tie all of the scattered writing together
0, Mostly disappointing: This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak
1, Farm Torch: This is a really great tool. It burns hot
1, Fiesta Napkins: FIESTA.....what's not to love? These are great
0, Price increase
1, Art and Pharmaceuticals: An astounding
1, Great!! a must buy if you are going to pass: I just took the network essentials exam and passed with room to spare. The book took what I had learned in the McBook (Microsoft Press Book)
0, The manga is better.: The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.) For those not in the know
0, KIMERA is and anime joke!: This is the most horrible Anime I'v ever seen! DONOT buy this tape! It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad! I only rented this movie thank god
1, Woolf's last novel: Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel
1, Pretty good.: I still liked this book but there is other chicken soup books that are more interesting
0," Doesn't compare to the first ""Teenage Soul"" book: I recieved both books for my birthday"
1, Sad
1, A paper best-friend: To put it succinctly
1, Almost better than the first book!: I stayed up all night reading that book and even if I almost fell asleep in class the next day i consider it well worth my time
1, Nothing lacking: I'm satisfied with the brightness
1, I love Willie.: I may wear out the CD just by playing it while in the car. The lyrics are so amusing and just fit the two singers and their life style.
0, Bummer: Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base. Could not return because of the liquid used in the themometer. =( Looks and feels cheap.
0, Don't bother with this brand: I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects. 1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful
0, Couldn't watch: I started trying to watch this and couldn't get more than 20 minutes in. Others my find it a good movie
0, RoboHelp 2000 for HTML Help: I was greatly disappointed with this book. It is poorly organized
1," Underappreciated WWII fiction of Panzer Grenadiers on the Eastern Front: Really good fictional account of a squad of Panzer Grenadiers as they fight to survive on the Eastern Front during WWII. This guy was actually a Panzer Grenadier on the Eastern Front during WWII and by the descriptions you can believe it.This author also wrote ""Panzer Grenadiers"" which is slightly better well known"
0, Collapse by Jared Diamond: the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
0, Pretty Basic: There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages
1, Five ways Civilizations Die - We are working on it: An excellent book that details the various ways those civilizations can collapse. He studies civilizations that have collapsed
0, Surprised at how bad this was: Jared Diamond can type a lot of words
0, Plates missing from the Kindle edition: This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images: 1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island
1, Important
0, Interesting
0, A lot of phaff and only directX 5.2: First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes
0, Chasing Ghosts from an Invented Past: Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf
0, Disappointing!: I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written
1, TO COMPLETE YOUR GIORDANO COLLECTION: AMAZING. TWO UNKNOWN OPERATIC JEWELS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. FIRST; LIVE PERFORMANCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WELL RECORDED
1, cannabis growing: This is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen on growing cannabis. A must for any one serious about growing marijuana or curious of the process.
1, 5 Stars: Amazing work
0, New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary: The book arrived promptly
1, The best product for crosswords.: This is my second copy of The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. I am replacing the first copy that I have worn completely out from constant use. I have over the years found no better assistance for crosswords than this product.
0, Disappointing: The potential for this to have been truly great is lost by the focus of the film. If you are not familiar with Mr. Carey's remarkable work
1, EMDR: This is a must have book for those using EMDR
1, Nice
0, For Programming Novices Only: This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you would like a good MSMQ reference buy Designing Applications with MSMQ by Alan Dickman. It is not perfect but is the most comprehensive text on MSMQ that I have read so far.
1, Never an IPOD believer..now I'm sold: I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear
0, BATTERY SUCKS: So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO
1, ipod nano 4gb-white: I love the ipod nano. It started when my friend got one
1, It's an iPod --- what more do you say?: I am giving it a 4 due to the simple fact of battery replacement. I am not looking forward to the day that it simply doesn't hold a charge anymore. But
0, Won't work with Windows: Don't waste you hard earned cash on this if you plan on using it with MS Windows. Windows recognizes the iPod but Apple iTunes does not. After 32 hours of trying to get it to work
0," No customising!: I should have paid more attention to the title. It's called ""Administering"" SAP R/3 and not ""Customising"". It explains how to use the different SD functions not how to implement them. Unfortunately"
1, A National Treasure: This double CD is stuffed full of great songs and amazing stories. My favorite stories are of Elaine's date with Marlon Brando
0, Disappointing!: This book was so disappointing! It lacked applicability to using the Active Directory.
1," Comfort food and reading...: The recipes in ""The Country Gourmet"" spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats. The remembrances of the author's mama and her love of food and life does more than feed the reader's soul"
0, It had it's good moments: I'm not sure what to say about this book
1, A thrilling life size novel.: This book was great. I was actually made to read this over the summer. When I first looked at it
1, An Exciting Read: Unique in that the narrator and heroine
1, Extraordinary!: Even a voracious reader (such as myself) can sometimes be unaware of a new voice in the land....I was unaware of Barbara Kingslover
0, It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.: The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately
0, Asimple REVIEW of us
0, H8ted it: I thought that it was really boring
1, AN ENJOYABLE READ: This is a story about a Taylor - a young woman who leaves her small Kentucky town and heads west - hoping to make something of her life. In her travels
0, A very disappointing read.: The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption
0, Interesting
0, Don't Waste Your Money: This book is an autobiography of Nicolas Darvas' life. There is nothing describing in clear detail the system he used and how he used it. Nicholas gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it magically shot up in price overnight and was restricted from anymore trading. He sold one stock that magically shot up for 171 dollars a share
0, Entertaining but not enough details: I got this book based on so many 5-star reviews posted here. This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However
0, hope for the stupid: This book illustrates that if someone as stupid as Nicholas Darvas can make money in the stock market so can you.After all
0, One of the VERY WORST!: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology
0," False advertising - avoid: Amazon claims ""training DVD to teach you all the features & functions & HOW TO USE & MAXIMIZE your Garmin unit"". What can I tell you? There are many many features and functions that are not mentioned at all. I have told Amazon to modify this claim and of course I am retuning it to them."
1, One of many great anime: Im 13 years old and I love this anime.Why
1, A Must Have
1, Great...: This show is my fav Anime series... its even my first..it has a killer story and very like-able charactors....
0, WHY??!WHY?!?!WHY?!?!: Why did they do this? why did they make a direct to video sequel to a movie that made money?It screams for a big screen sequel that starts off where the original ended.not a flick that takes a simple premise and dumbs it down
0, Definitely not Carpenter's best..: Definately not one of Carpenter's (who I am not a huge fan of anyway) best; it was written very lazily & directed (and acted) badly. Maybe it was the stupid/lame title
1," Come on....it wasn't that bad.: The movie wasn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It surely wasn't ""the worst vampire movie ever"". Jon Bon Jovi didn't suck in the roll either."
0, 0 STARS: Los Feces: Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor
0, Dont quit your day job...: Dont waste the money on this stinker. Jon
0, Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldJP: I Didn`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So
1, Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldEF: I really
0, great music
0, Not for those just starting ms sql server or ms in general: I was presented this book and told 'learn how to set up sql server'. Not from this. Aside from grammatical problems that make it hard to read
1, Strange and wonderful: Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play
0," Ideal for the Web developer new to the Microsoft tool set...: After reading ""Professional Active Server Pages"" and ""Active Visual Basic 5.0"""
1, Baking Book That Takes The Cake!!!: This book is full of wonderful recipes that just prove that Maida Heatter is the expert on baking. I started off with the Zucchini bread
0, Magical shrinking leggings: These leggings were great out of the package. They fit perfectly and were very soft. However
0, Big Fail: These leggings sit low on the waist
0, Shrunk and See Through: These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality
1, Works for Me!: I've had these leggings for about 2 months now. I wash on gentle and hang dry (like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer). They do sit a little below the waist
1, Egg shaper: Bought this for my husband. I had a metal one but the eggs stuck to it. This one I thought it would melt but it doesn't and the eggs don't stick either. It's easy to clean. This one is a keeper.
1, WE WERE SOLDIERS: Sorry some people have been disappointed that this is not the soundtrack. But...the music is a perfect tribute to the film and the men portrayed there. I am a veteran and a close friend of Joe Galloway
0," Misleading: This ""soundtrack"" should have been titled ""Music inspired by We were Soldiers"" or something to that tune. If you want the actual score/ soundtrack of this film"
0, Excellent movie but very poor soundtrack album: The movie is one of the best Vietnam era movies I have seen but this soundtrack had only 2 songs on it that I recalled being in the movie. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with the movie instead of paying also for the soundtrack.
1, I LOVE this book!: I initially got Kathryn Marsden's little book on Food Combining which is a great beginner (explainer). This one goes into much more detail but still keeps everything so simple. Once you learn the premise
1, A real gem: Just as good as 'Silk Roads'
1," This album is a ""OASIS"" for kitaro-fans !: When I first came over this album for many years ago"
1, brilliance.: crimes is absolutely the best album of the year
1, SCAN DISK SANSA MP3 PLAYER: THE ITEM BECAME DEFECTIVE AND AMAZON REPLACED THE ITEM WITH NO COST TO ME
0, The dreaded STP error: It's amazing to me that there could be an MP3 player that allows one to corrupt it by simply uploading slightly more data that it shows. That's what happened. Pathetic. Playng volume is weak
0, anything but an ipod: i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative
1, Great Value: I bought 2 of these for my daughters
0, OK if you ignore the FM abilities: I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time
0, I was very unhappy: What can I say. I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it. I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features. However
1, Excellent tutorial to Python language.: Learning Python fills the gap for a printed introduction to the Python language. The layout is natural and methodical. Although I had picked up a good deal of the material beforehand from the online documentation and trial and error use of Python
1, still a good read: Having read this book a couple of years ago
0, The Above Reviews are Phoney: It's some writer working under a pseudonym
1, Rodan you bet: Rodan is a complete story. It includes people elements and the state of the arts special effects for the times. I have been looking for a clear copy of this film and this is it.
0, You've got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!: This has to be the all time worst sci-fi flick since the mesozoic era. Poor acting. Poor directing. Poor scenery and effects...
0, Subtitles? Original Japanese language track? Didn't think so: I've always been a big fan of all the Toho monster movies and had been awaiting this DVD release with baited breath. Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing
0, This book is not detailed enough.: You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book. (thats unacceptable to me) I was disappointed with this purchase. Novells online manuals contain far more information and its free.
1, Ironpants for the people: The heavy denim material seems to wear really well and the workmanship is excellent. For a working man or for someone hard on pants
0," Not Nearly So Good As I Had Hoped: After reading ""Generation X' and ""Shampoo Planet"" I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in ""Generation X"" and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were."
1, Insightful: Thought provoking. I would expect nothing less from Douglas Coupland. He has his own unique way at looking at the world and it comes across clearly in this book
1, Catcher in the Rye
1," These are our children!: How many books can you honestly say made you cry? I cried over these ""letters"" from young people trying to get a college education. They have seen such terrible violence and yet they find ways to write their hearts out for two splendid teachers"
0, so horrible we couldn't endure it
0," Hackneyed magic realism: Hackneyed magic realism - kitsch and cliche.The cover of this edition features a quote from Marquez:""...unmistakeable reading pleasure.""Surely the complete quote must be something along the lines of:""Even Stefan Zweig"
1," Dali produces a little gem: I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june 09. Amongst the exhibits was a 7 minute dvd of a surrealist love fantasy which Dali made in collaboration with Walt Disney productions.This film is a whimsical lyrical glide through Dali's surrealist world. Truly a little gem.I also saw some of his ink and pencil drawings.They depict a technical mastery which has been compared to that of DaVinci. Most great artists are masters of drawing.You won't be disappointed with ""Destino""."
0, Junk: Mine was dead out of the box. Hey America
1, Texas slice of life: Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I
0, Possibly the worst Godzilla film made: This sequel to Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla makes its predecessor look like Oscar material. Godzilla doesn't appear in this movie until mid-way through it. When he finally does show up
1, A Must read for students of all ages: Well-written with rich universal themes
1, Fantastic!: I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things
1," The Chosen:Understanding: in reading ""The Chosen"" i was very pleased with the book. The plot was very touching as we saw the boys (Danny and Reuven) grow from the grounds of a baseball field to the advanced college campus. Their friendship was very strong and was normally able to overcome most obstacles...except for the silence that Danny and Reb Saunders had between them. Mr. Malter brought Rueven up in talking"
0, Over Exaggerated!!: This book is based on teenagers. In todays society children can not relate to the characters of this book
1, A superb story: 'The Chosen' is a story of friendship that considers and is impacted by the relevancy of an ancient faith in a modern world and the clash between the different ways of approaching such faith. The debates within the book hold particular interest for religions in which faith tends to also become a culture and lifestyle. Potok vividly presents both the joys and the frustrations associated with such religious culture. The story is beautifully told
1, a great example of the struggle for zionism in the 1940's: ok
1, He reads very slowly: I like the guy's voice
0, Ordered over a month ago and still haven't received it!!!: The person who I ordered this from took the money and never sent the product. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back!!! Never use them!!!
0, boring and waaaayyy too much detail: like most people
1, Good Entry HTPC case.: The Antec NSK2400 case is a good entry level HTPC case. It is a nice size with a pretty nice finish. It is a quiet case that cools well. However the 380 power supply is a little low on the power end
1, extra hanging space where you need it: This product is great for the laundry room
1, Great device: We did not have any place to hang my wife's dresses so they would not touch the floor in our laundry room. Installed this and solved the problem. When it is closed you never know it is there.
1, best idea: Just wanted to say that my grandaughter is so taken with anything that Elmo does that at 18m she is so brilliant
1, Up Down
0, Disappointing: From the advertisement
0," Big disappointment: The version that was released on DVD a couple of years ago is by far the best. This version is supposed to be ""restored""? My copy still has the scratches in the frames and skips every now and then. My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version. Yes"
0," Misleading Title: The description of the book ""illustrate them with 150 inspired examples"" is very misleading. The author talked about 150 riffs. You are supposed find the actual riff tabs somewhere else. After buying this book"
1, Interesting and informative.: A well done presentation of the story of O author and here perspectives on the book. The quality of the film is also very good.
1, Excellent work by a master.: Although it's not as well known as some of his other work this is Pohl at his best! Take the worst trends of society right now and that's where this book starts. This is the sequel to Space Merchants and in some ways it's a redrafting of that story. Excellent.
1," Pretty Good: My son really likes the ""Dave Series"". It's very informative and funny for my 4 year old. The only thing I didn't care for about this series is that Dave seems to get angry (in a funny way) a little too much. My son has commented about Dave hitting Becky."
0, High speed adventures: I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed. Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action. Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.
1, Robert Frost: For anyone who love Robert Frost poetry this book is an amazingly wonderful read. With each poem is an article telling about the circumstances when the poem was written. In this way more understanding of the poem evolves.
0, Grossly Outdated Material: While this may have been a very good book in 1979
1," A must have for the Godzilla collection...: I am not sure what the fascination is with Godzilla but my son loves these monsters. This collection is good for the ""b-movies"" of Godzilla. I was not aware of the monster symbols noting the monsters contained in all the Godzilla dvds(but now I know). This is very good price for amount of Godzilla dvds you get. I would say that this is good quatity-wise rather quality. However my son loves it"
1, Audio is underrated...: I found this review to be clear
0, Shallow coverage of servlets
1, 100 Times Better Than Jason Hunter's book...: This is a great book on Servlets. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book. It teaches you the basics and goes beyond the API docs.If you want a thorough walkthrough of the Java Servlet FAQ
0, Who edited this thing?: The book seems like a bomb someone dropped then ran. They leave no contact information for book updates
1, Absolutely terrific ! 1: LOVED IT ! What a great story. Gabe and Kelsey are great together. Both strong and gentle. Suspenseful to the very end. This story has it all
1, True Betrayals: This book starts with a woman named Kelsey who is trying to get over her divorce
0, Old map: This map is out dated and doesn't show many of the secondary roads. I lost this map the first day that I was in Belize
1, Just what I needed: Having recently bought a jeep
1, 4-Wheel Drive Trails: This book is very helpful to the novice or experienced off roader. It is very descriptive of trails
0, disappointing and overpriced: This 14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable
1, This book is a must read for anyone: This book takes you from group homes to the mean streets of Harlem where Claude Brown tested fate and even some of societies taboos yet was able to pull himself up from the ghetto. He looks at child hood frineds that slipped through the cracks of society that became heroin addicts
0, Avid true crime reader but;....: this book was the only book I have purchased in true crime that I could not get into. I would be lucky if I read 10 pages. I only wish I could have returned it!
1, Fun: This is the best comic book game out there. The actors capture the characters perfectly. Especially Spider-Man. The graphics are great for Playstation. It's just a fun game to play. Oh
0, Horrible Printing: The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes. It seems every word that should start with 'h' starts with 'b'. How can this occur in the age of spell-checkers? Chesterton deserves better. This printing is absolute garbage. The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.
0, Low Quality Edition Full of Errors: This edition must have been created by scanning an older one
0, Good book ruined by an incompetent publisher: This may have been a fine work in its original form
0, Disappointing: I was initially excited about this book.Hearing claims of wit and graceful apologetics. Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good. It seemed hard to follow and the points or arguments that were used were poor.They could've easily been refuted with other arguments that I didn't even agree with. I know that wasn't the main point of the book but honestly after reading it I'm not sure I know what that was anyway.
0, Great book
0, Egregiously cheap
0, Misleading book: This seems to be a converted thesis to book
0, It is NOT a starter kit
1, Previous reviewer reasonably unhappy: I understand perhaps why the previous reveiwer was unhappy about this new book. Although I am relatively new to Kohl
1, Blue Ray vs DVD: I own both the original DVD and the Blue Ray Disc of this movie. I have played them both and it is impossible to compare the two together. The Blue Ray Disc offers much more clarity and sound to that of the standard DVD. It was given to me as a present and I plan to gradually replace my standard DVD's - at least those I particularly want to see in Blue Ray - to get the most out of the movie experience.I highly recommend this product to those interested in an incredible Visual and Audio experience.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]
1, Off the Chain!: I don't know why this film didn't get more attention? The authenticity is amazing
0, The longest plane trip ever: Master and commander
1, An Excellent Naval War; Strategy and Action Movie...: If you like war
1, Good movie: This is a very good movie
0," Defective DVD: ""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" is a great movie. However"
0, Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: Wow! Am I ever happy I did not spend 10 bucks to see this in the theater. It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Granted
0, Damaged DVD: This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it. It was returned and picked up on 1.4.10 and I have not yet received a credit for it. Please let me know how to proceed and receive my credit so I can purchse another DVD. I was very excited about viewing it and would still like the opty to do so. Thank you.
0, A movie about blond hair
0, Beautiful But Boring: England is at war with France. Russell Crowe plays a sea captain chasing after an American-made French ship. Not throughout the entire movie was I made to feel like I had to chase the ship too. I never felt the obsession on the level I was intended to. First it was a Moby Dick movie
1, Good movie
1, Top notch audio
1, For God and Country: The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However
0, Yuck: Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe. He did not really have a lot of lines to say. The movie was very boring in my opinion.
0, no go: my husband got himself all set up for a peaceful aftenoon viewing
0, Expect nothing and you may not be disappointed: I walked out of this film with nothing
0, most disappointing of any Crowe film...........: The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.The dialogue was often drowned in it.....Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........If you think that this film is exciting
0, waste of time......: I wanted so bad to like this movie
1, Good step by step guide: The book is spoton and easy to follow. However I need to use scripting for version 4.0b. Is there one available for that? Is there one coming out soon?
1, Outstanding: This was my first O'Reilly book
0, ok
1, An Almost Adequate Dvd II: The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However
0, Good movie
0, Wannabe Beatles: It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.
1," Admitted Oasis fan says ""Go buy this CD!"": Okay"
1, Classic Oasis is back: This album to me far out weighs Be Here Now and to consider the kind of mainstream music out there now
0, Damn
0, Oh come
0," Where's Liam?: I'm a big Oasis fan. I was one of those few people who actually thought ""Be Here Now"" was brilliant"
1, Oasis is finally back!: Oasis is probably one of my fave rock groups ever. I've been waiting for a long time for this album to come out since The Masterplan. SOTSOG is great! I think I got the explicit version (it has two red X's
0, what a waist of time: Who would have thought
0, Boring Movie: What a disappointment this movie was. It had really good actors but it was slow
0, Bad language alert: When a movie gives Jesus the F word as a middle name I can't watch it and it is all over for me.
0, Then she found me.: Hard language was not expected! The F bomb is dropped including
0, helen hunt is like a piano with one key: From the beginning of the movie
1, Kind of Slow but Good Story: Watched this with my mom and four aunts. Totally a chick-flick. Good story
0, Bette Midler Saved This Movie From A One Star: This movie started slow and an hour into it I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen
0, Where's the comedy?: The bright spot in this movie was Bette M. I don't understand how an actor of Firth's calibre could waste his talents by appearing in this drivel. To characterize this movie as a comedy is a total misleading fib. Nothing like the book!
0, utter tripe: this book is down there with linux unleashed. It tries to cover every linux topic under the sun
0, Imports are silly/don't buy it.: Sorry
0, Awful: This book is horrible. Written as if the person reading it chews rubber-bands and drinks glue for entertainment. Avoid any class using this book. Would give .10 star if possible.
0, Hair: Its Power and Meaning....: An awful atrocity of the literary genre. It was like the personal notebooks of various authors compiled into an uneven mess. Too many articles
0, Where's the heat?: This one's going back to the store. It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat. If you ask me
0, This Book Doesn't Deliver: I bought this book after it was rated one of the top ten real estate books of the year in the Los Angeles Times real estate section. Boy
0, Lacks detail in Backup & Recovery Section: I used this book (Exam Cram - Test 3 & Test 4 for OCP) and the Jason Couchman (Oracle Press) DBA Exam Guide (the one that's over 1000 pages in length) to review recently for the Backup & Recovery Exam for the Oracle Certified Professional Track. This book's section on Backup and Recovery really wasn't adequate in my opinion to pass the test. It did provide a very good general overview
1, EXCELLENT: Excellent at removing small scratches from auto finish without damaging the paint. I have used this for years and found nothing better.
0, bleah: Schlock Rock
0, Only good if you know the program: This book is a good reference but not for those who are not proficient already in MAX. As others have stated
0, the pill splittter did not work at all well the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin): the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin). I am very disappointed in it. Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one?
1, Boxes
1, Great Book: Easy to follow instructions. Every recipe I tried was a success. The lack of pictures is a minus. I strongly recommend it
0, Publisher's Dream: It is fairly obvious that the publisher is going to milk this series for all its worth.There are indications that a number of writers/editors may be involved with writing for the series.Nothing at all wrong with this
0, A long series made seemingly endless with this book: I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos
1, Lord of Chaos: This book is my personal favorite so far in the series. It had many pros and a little con. the pros were: the creating of the black tower. the healing nyneave can do. and the last chapter is very good. there is also much much more. the bad sides are there are still long talks between nyneave and elayne. The boring tugging of braids
1, The definitive exploration of fantasy writing in our time.: Robert Jordan continues his complex tale of Rand 
0, This book may just make me quit reading this whole series: I can't believe the number of good reviews I've seen on this book. This volume advances the plot by so little
0," Never ending: I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:""how many books there were going to be in the series?"" 7 to 9 he says"
0, Great book
0, Yawn....: ....when I had trouble sleeping at night...all I had to do was pick this book up and I'd be passed out within 15 minutes. I've read the first six books of this series
1, I don't understand people: I really don't understand the mindset that would say this isn't a good book. It was spellbinding. There is character development. You care whether most of the characters live or die. There is ample development of the storyline and you feel a move to the end of the series especially with the massive developments of the end. It may not be great literature (but then it may be)
1, Excellent purchase!: I was not willing to spend the $700 for Toyota to put the towing kit on my vehicle so I picked up the Hopkins adapter and a towing kit off ebay for under $200. Installed all in under an hour
1, Great Product
1," ""Dave"" video series: My son LOVES all these videos! I think the guy ""Dave"" is a little corny but he does do an amazing job showing kids all the trucks"
0," This book is complicate and ugly: This book starts with ""What is PL/SQL?"". But through the following 900 pages"
0, Not a reference book: This book is useless as reference it doesnt fully describe basic functions like to_number. author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers. waste of money
1, God's love
0, Not quite the Originals: Beware
0, Don't bother ordering these: The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic
0, Bought for Mercedes: I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
1, Ray Ban Sunglasses: I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon
0, Confused look at ATL: While I respect the authors as programmers since this book does contain some valuable information
0, There are better books than this: I was looking forward to this book for several months. It was supposed to be released originally Oct. '98
1, We love it
1, Simple - It's good to be me!: The one who loves Gene Simmons or Kiss will love this - Gene is crazy - but perfect and this is why we love these DVDs. We bought the 1st two packages so it was clear to us - to also buy No. 3. In germany you are not able to buy these packages and in TV you will always get a translated version - that's boring.
0, Another fake reality show: This show is entertaining
0, One of the least useful I've encountered!: I find this set to be next to useless. The Italian on it is so very basic that it's an insult to anyone who has already made any effort at all to learn the language. For all its faults
0, ELP Goes POP - Lets Us All Down.: I am a lifelong fan of ELP. My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall
0," C++? I don't think so!: The caption on the front of this book says: ""Provides a concise"
1, Very good book: I truly enjoyed the book. Very interesting story line and very thought provoking. Well written and I couldn't put it down.
0, too far fetched: Find something else to read. This is not believable. I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle.
1, LOVED IT TO THE END...: This is my third Picoult novel and I have the fourth ready to start. I was riveted by this book and stayed up until 6:00 a.m. 2 nights in a row to get it finished. I LOVED it until the final paragraph. Then she lost me. I still give it 4 stars because she's an awesome writer
1, God
1, Keeping Faith: Jodi Piccoult is the most amazing author! Her in depth research and portrayal of controversial subjects is astounding. Every one of her books seems as if she's telling her own story. Great read!
1, Keeping Faith: I love this book
1, Excellent book!!: Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult
1, so wonderful: wonderful writing
1, always enjoy her books: Jodi's books are predictable (drama + court case) but I always enjoy her writing and find I always learn something new.
1, a nice surprise!: I have been reading Jodi's books wayyyyy before she became so mainstream. I never bought this book though because the topic seemed really iffy to me. I just didn't see how she could pull off this topic and make it into a good book. After getting her newsletter though and seeing one of the characters would be in her new book
1, Keeping Faith: This is an unusual book
1, keeping faith: An easy read with a good story line...keeps you guess til the end! If you a Jody Picoult fan you will enjoy this 1
0," Not a page turner: I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the ""deeper message"
0, You have to like the heroine and I didn't: My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people
1, Great Book for Learning about TCP/IP !: I found TCP/IP JumpStart very helpful on a topic that is new to me. Computer networking field is a new topic that adds dimension to my portfolio. Andrew Blank has a wonderful way of teaching so a novice can understand yet an intermediate doesn't get bored. He brings examples and illustrations to the text enabling you to understand or actually visualize the technology concept. TCP/IP JumpStart brings technology into terms for beginners
1, A collection of one of the best comedies ever: This collection of all 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers is great! It is a nicely packaged 3-disc set and the episodes are all classic and gut-bustingly hilarious. I highly recommend purchasing this complete set.
0, Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series
1, Classic Cleese: It's such a shame only 12 episodes were made...This is great English comedy... in fact great universal comedy..I loved it... John Cleese is a Genius.
1, Laughter is the best medicine: My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage. The episodes have never let us down
0, overRated!: I'm sorry
1, Fawlty not Farty: I love BBC comedy & this was a great addition to my collection - FUNNY! I can just play it for great background slapstick when I'm piddling around the house even...
1, BUY THIS TODAY!!: I'm a stickler when it comes to comedy-especially tv comedy. When I saw this series back in the 70's I laughed very hard. Now that it's on DVD complete with all 12 episodes
1, A must have.: Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid. A must have in any collection.
0, dissapointing!: only good song was lyla and even that was no good
1, Oasis rockin'!: This album many not blow you away on the first listen
1, Oasis are generally good.: Really
0, Waste of paper. waste of plastic
0, Modern Oasis is Rubbish: The one star is for Liam's hair on the inside cover. At least that still has it's dignity.As for the music
1, Love it even more!!!!: Again
0, Could be so much better: Housing is made very well
0, Died... On a self-destruct logic board: Until the logic board went and self-destructed
0, Refurbished but not tested?: I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box
0," Digital ""remastering"" is horrible: This CD does not do Mr. Rifkin justice at all. It sounds like a cheap ""MIDI"" version of Rikin's playing - like a cheap $50 electric keyboard. Gone are the acoustic sound that can be heard on the concert grand that Rifkin's original recordings are played on. You're better off buying the ""UN-mastered"" original CD from Nonesuch Records. This is an insult to one of the greatest Joplin interpreters."
0, Not worth the money: Don't publishers proof read these books anymore? Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions. This book also does not cover things on the exam such as Compatibility settings. It seems as though the author just took the exam topics and wrote something that he thought was important
0, Not a well written book: Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read. I read many travel books but this one is awful.
1, Cassette? This is 2010. Where's the CD Version: I just want to say that this is my favorite book of all time. The writing of William Least-Heat Moon is filled with wonder. I give it a 10 out of 10!!!However this is 2010 and I still find it strange that Audiobooks; for the most part are only available on Cassette. Heck
1, Wonderful for the whole family: Little Britches is a fantastic book. It takes the reader back to early 1900 Colorado and a family who loved each other and worked very hard as they struggle to build their ranch. This is the first book in a series and once you start reading you won't want to stop. Ralph (Little Britches) learns a lot of life's lessons the hard way. His father's parenting skills gently lead Ralph to make the right choices. There are horses
1, Pretty good reading: The writing style was simple; The storyline was engaging
0, Absolute trash ...: I bought the first edition of this book - which was about 700 pages;It cost me $44.95 - and the book was not worth a penny! I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!
0, Heavy Paperweight: This book starts strong
0, Where is the real content?: I purchased this book on the strength that it was written by the creater of SGML so I figured 'how bad can it be?' Well I found out exactly how bad. This book fails to explain anything thouroughly
0, WORST book I have come across in a LONG time....: This is a seriously awful book. It is without doubt the ugliest most badly designed book I have ever seen. Much worse it is badly written
0, Where are the examples?????: For the money I shelled out for this book
0, Useless: An absolutely useless source for information on xml. The examples were not clear or useful
0, Advertising in a tech book?: One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend. The authors sold corporate sponsorship of chapters and let each company write an chapter-length ad. Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos
1, Excellent book! Well written and full of great information.: This book is an excellent choice for learning about XML and the technologies (both new and old) that are utilizing or planning on utilizing XML. This book has something for everyone in the XML world
1," Great XML Overview: Just wanted to say that this is a great book especially if you like ""real"" XML implementation examples. If you want an overview of what XML can do for you go get this book."
1, Good transaction: Product arrived quickly
1, Abduction to the Ninth Planet: I am blown away by this book
0, Doesn't work with itouch: no wonder it was only [...] bucks
1, SPITTING NEARLY: I
1, Enjoyable BUT....: I thoroughly enjoyed this book but
0, Coming out story made by straight people: At first I was gonna give it 3 stars. But after I had read some other reviews (I didn't have a chance to watch additional comments on dvd)
1, Great story
0, Worth the price and not a penny more: I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $20. With how little I paid for them
1, Triumph's Most Consistent: I thought this one was gonna suck and I only bought it because I'm OCD and a completist. However
0, Complete waste of money!!!: I bought this book based on the review I read in InfoWorld. I will have to say that this book provides little more than your IDE's online help. About the only thing this book is good for is kindling for my wood burning stove.
1, R & B Season 5: There are a lot of excellent reviews of this set
1, good reference book: this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later.
0, don't buy the kindle edition: i got the kindle edition and returned it the next day
1," Winter boot: Love the boots. Very warm and thick. The boots are ""heavy"" but it's just want you need in real bad snowy conditions that require good treads. They also fit very snug - but soft & comfortable with the interior padding."
1, Beats of the heart: Amazing music. exellent explanations
0, You get what you pay for: It is unfortunate that Guy De M is known in the USA for his short stories. They are well-written and were ground-breaking 150 years ago
1, Cool Watch: Honestly
0, SHM CD version of Trilogy: This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive
0, Not thorough
1, WOW!!!!: Que has done it again!! The leader in advanced computer books bring one of the best books for beginning Linux system operators

1, Cookers for Dummies: I purchased this book with my new pressure cooker. It has some wonderful tips. It gives you an idea of how long to cook beans
0, For smart dummies: The book didn't answer a lot of basic questions for me
0, Not as good smelling as I thought.: Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.

0, waste of money: i needed some comments on the linux ip code
0, It didn't do Lord Soth justice!: The book
1, Review of Village Centenary: Miss Read books are lovely stories of the everyday life of a village schoolteacher. They are wholesome
1, Good Start for beginers: This is a good start for somebody who never build a PC before
0, out of date: It's a good book but is a few years old so the material is dated. I wouldn't recommend it.

1, This book should not leave your desk...A very good reference: If you are new or have been using Linux or Unix this is a bookfor you desk next to your computer system. This book has been a pleassureto read and use. I am using the book as a teaching guide forfriends
1, Banana Hammok: Want your banana just hanging in the breeze or do you want your banana hanging in style. Well for the stylish hangers this is the display you want. Looks great and is very heavy duty.
1, Not just for bananas
1, Outstanding director: Daugthers of Darkness is more than a surreal masterpiece.It's an unforgettable experience.But for when on DVD more of Harry Kumel'sfilms
0, Save yourself! Don't see this hideous film!: Worse than a merely bad film is a self-important bad film. This monstrosity drips with artsy pretensions
1, Amazingly deep for its length: A slim book
1, Live and hilarious but missing something.: Hi
0, Cheesy Heroes: My three-year old grandson loves anything to do with firetrucks and firemen
1, safer replacement for traditional wax candle: Safer than a traditional wax candle. Gives the same amount of light. I use this on my Nursing Graduation while reciting the Florence Nightingale pledge. Looks nicer on a low light room.
0, Don't last: Batteries don't last very long
1, EXCELLENT FLICKERING LED CANDLES!: I bought this 12-candle pack for Christmas decor and I'm really satisfied with product quality. Flame effect is life-like
0," This was a disappointment: I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the ""right answers"" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary."
1, great book if you want to know the science behind Cryonics: Goes through and explains the science behind cryonics. It disproves what many of the cryonics detractors assert. Over all a good read!
0, Why is Amazon charging for Kindle version of this?: This story is well over 50 years old and in the public domain so why is Amazon charging for the Kindle version of this? It should be free. And it is free - a quick Google search will reveal full text versions that you can read online for free.
0, Where's the 3D?: I watched the whole thing without the glasses - with them it was just dark and not 3D at all. Very disappointed.
0, One boys dream of flying and finding the girl of his dreams: I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids
0, Ultimate Writer's Cramp: Once again Imax has tried to combine a story with spectacular photography. I would think by know I would have learn my lesson. But you mention the word Imax combine with the Grand Canyon
0, Disappointing Quality and Content: This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful
0," This is definitely NOT ELP!: ELP should have quit while they ahead with ""Black Moon"" (1992) and ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall"" (1993) in terms of their ephemoral 90's comeback. ""In the Hot Seat"" was just tarnished by quick-fix greed in terms of the quality its tracks are presented in. There isn't a single shred of any timeless ELP instrumental quirks to be found in any of these songs"
1," It's Good; Not Sure if ""Superfast"" is the Word"
1, A very good reader: I thought the reader for this book was very good. He did Palpatine's voice especially well. I also felt that the book filled in gaps about character motivations that there wasn't time to cover in the movie. I felt the book enriched my experience of the movie.
0, Where's the witty dialogue?: The thing that hooked me on the Star Wars saga was the incredibly constant bickering and arguing that happens in episodes IV and V: C3PO and R2D2
1, I Envy Lee Pulos: When I pulled several hypnosis books off the library shelf to review
1, A part of our history
1, the reason we have 5 stars: The first epic saga. Vivien Leigh is magnificent and Hattie McDaniel deserved an award. You sure don't need me to tell you about Gone with the Wind. A must for and and all movie buffs.Just wanted to say I'm pleased with the DVD version.
0, i would have rated it higher if only I can watch it: It keeps stopping
1, 1.33:1 Ratio: The only thing bothers me is this movie is not a widescreen format.But after careful research
0," Not Wide-Screen Version: Re: ""Gone With the Wind"" (The Scarlett Edition): Beware. Even though this 3-disc set is Blu-Ray"
1, This is the greatest movie of the century....: This movie is an epic....and while
1, One of the best movies of all time: I love this movies so much. I forget how many times I have watched it. And every time I watch it gives me new excitement.
1, What? No widescreen? Sacrilege!: I was very disappointed to find my all-time favorite film
0, Romantic Racism: You have to give credit to this film for its glossy
0, Awful
1, Gone With the Wind: Very happy with the DVD and the timely manner in which it was shipped. Amazon always does an amazing job of gettingthe product out to the customer. Thank you. I give this item a 5 star rating.
1, Gone With the Wind is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!: There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said about Gone With The Wind. What a magnificent motion picture for it's day and now for today as well. The DVDS' are a tribute to this must have film for your home library.
0, boring: I hope I'm watching the same movie that got so many 5 stars!! I found this movie to be big time boring. Couldn't even handle fast forward :)
0, gone with the wind: This sucked because it arrived with only one dvd in it
1, most excellent: At least for the beginner (myself)
0, These books are terrible!: Before you buy the Remote Access book from Tom Thomas read my comments on Tom Thomas's BCSN book.
1, Wonderful!: Despite having seen and enjoyed the film featuring Humphrey Bogart
1, For Maggie the Mod dog: If you are one of those consumers (as I am) that will purchase products because of aesthetics
0, Rabin Solo Album + Yes: If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes
1, Best Yet!: I don't know what makes this product different from the others but so far it's the best I've used yet. I'm able to do just about anything within minutes of painting my nails.
1, Amazing!: I love this product! I really love all of OPI's products... but this works really well for me. After a minute they are dry to the touch and after 5 minutes they are set. I will say that if you apply base
0, Doesnt work.: Honestly I dont think this product works. I followed instructions carefully and it did not work. My manicure was not fully dry at all.
0, DW may be better than MS-FrontPage
1, Place in the woods: Ecellent book to read. If you like wilderness books it is hafta read book. Interesting through out. Book keeps your attention through out
1," I keep going back to this book!: Green Darkness is one of those rare books that I keep rereading year after year. I just read it again after seeing ""Elizabeth"" and am reminded of what an excellent book this is. It is truly one of my favorites!"
1, 100 Stars!!!: This book was amazing! I absolutely LOVED it. It was hard to believe that this book was written in 1972! Just like in Katherine(written in 1954!)
0, Trying to be Cujo: Okay
0," Possibly the worst book ever about motorcycling: The author may be a great guy but this book is just plain awful. I've read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down. If you need to read a ""motorcycle"" book to know it's hot in Texas"
0, doesn't shoot: when it does shoot
0, brothersjudddotcom barely recommends: When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses
0, What am I missing? I found the book dull and unsatisfying.: I have read all the positive reviews and I am a bit stumped. I found the early chapter about the relationship between the mother and daughter very tedious and meaningless. I almost stopped reading after that chapter
1, Emerson Lake & Palmer at the top of their game!: This U.K. Sony re-master is the best sounding of all there re-issues of this album
0, Save Your Money: I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds. Go back and find the original Atlantic version...crank up your stereo...and enjoy the *dynamics* of the music.
0," recall: We obtain a vinyl disc ELP ""Brain salad surgery"" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive"
0, Pfaltzgraff Dinnerware Set: One Plate already cracked. I ordered round Serving Bowl
0," Could have been about skateboarding: Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled ""Hiking with your bar buddies"
1, Indian Territory: You cannot get much better than a good Gene Autry movie. The Quality is very good and the restoration is top notch.
1, Singable Psalms: For over ten years I have shared these settings of the Psalms with Christians and Jews in worship services. Webber's wording is creative and current. His choice of metrical patterns makes these psalms usable with literally hundreds of tunes familiar to all who worship with these ancient Hebrew poems. I could wish Webber had versified the entire Psalter
0, Leaves much to desire: The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.
0, LOVE Jim Croce
1," Oustanding collection: This album was a must-have for me because of all the tracks in general and one in particular. It is also a well-made album with very good acoustic quality. ""Time in a Bottle"" is a special song for my wife and I. So is ""I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song""; and there are other favorites on this and other albums. In January 2011 we celebrated our 40th Anniversary with dinner at Croce's Restaurant in San Diego. (Owned by his widow Ingrid. If you are a Jim Croce fan and in or visiting San Diego"
0, Horrible text: My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies. I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen. The book is written as a narrative with no bullets
0, Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.: Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After 1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a 10 year old Casio watch that is used in swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
1, Fantasic HRM with all the features you need
1, Tarzan rocks: My son had this game when he was young and I just loved to play it. This copy does try to act up on me a little but with patience
1, A poigant book: This book was wonderful when I read it as a child
0, Very disturbing book: I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact
1, Strange
1, Excellent Resource: O'Relly books are generally great sources and this one is no exception. I've been programming with Perl for CGI
0, Short-Lived: When it worked
0, Poor Quality: I don't recommend this microwave. Think it only lasted about a year. A little over...spend a little more and get something that will last longer. Evidently the parts on this were not made to last long. One day it just started being really noisy and no cooking think that says the magnetron (microwave producing element) was dead. I am glad i did not review after purchase coz now can let folks know it is not made to last...I will get another brand this time around!
0, HORRIBLE!!!: I bought these last spring for trapping and they lasted the one week I trapped muskrats with just a small leak
0, Waste of money: These waders only lasted three outings. They were always rinsed off after use
1," A starter for any potential Orb fan!: I remember the first time I heard an Orb song. It was during one of my weekened/midnight excursions around Dallas and they played ""Fluffy Little Clouds"" I got the weirdest sensation when I first listend to this song. Felt like someone was lightly running the tip of a very cold knife up and down my spine. I LIKED IT! So I ran out and grabbed this particular album. Some of the songs grabs you immediately. Others take time to grow on you.Having said that if you get any of their other albums"
1, A great album: This is a really nice ambient album
0," Your 10-year-old brother with a trance track: Once again I've been suckered by glowing reviews into purchasing an album that could have been made by an auto plant robot. It's basically the opening track of ""Dark Side of the Moon"" overlaid with old newscast voices and your little brother blowing bubbles through his straw. The best I can say for this is that it's not as obnoxious as Lesiem's ""Mystic Spirit Voices."" I'm sticking with Steve Roach."
0, USB connection in tablet fails.: I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
1, Sounds immediately attracted my 7 year old Grandson: The musical sounds immediately attracted the attention of my 7 year old Grandson. It is a charming disc and one worth purchasing.
0, great propoganda: This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
0, A decent mug
0, Doesn't flow; big disappointment: I had the prior version of this mug and loved it. As other posters have noted
0, Disappointed: When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out. I tried to adjust screw of lid as was suggested. It worked but next time I used it it went back to allowing very little of liqui to come out. I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from.
0, The reviews are for the wrong performance!: The performance is
0, Only symbols and images
1, Classic!: I first heard about Larry from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The thing I like best about Larry is he shows you can be funny without cursing and making sex jokes left-and-right. I think most commedians curse just to get people in the audience.Larry is funny
1, Excellent book
1, It takes a lot of time and practice: The graphics in this game were somewhat bad
1, ...Here's To One More...: Not often does an indie band make such a hugh impression
1, Excellent Reference for BIND version 4: This Book is a must have for anyone seriously doing DNS work today. The upcoming 3rd edition will cover BIND Version 8
0, Great idea...too much errata: I bought this book thinking it would be a nice kick-start to ASP and Visual InterDev. I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day 1.The coding
0, Arabian Prince bombs on his comeback CD...: I got this CD not too long ago
1, Excellent production of a classic story: If you enjoyed Good Bye Mr Chips and Harry Potter
1, Five Easy Gardens- Anyone can grow the prime...: This book is an invaluable asset in showing the home grower something that all the other books virtually overlook
0, Out of date: There are still some sound principles in this book
1, good for sensitive skin: truly good
1, Good old fashioned entertainment: First of all
1, Great band: Why didn't I heard about this band?Back in the seventies listened STYX
1, Dark and disturbing: Intense
1," A drug movie that's really a love story: I like this movie. I saw it years ago when it first came out and it really ""stayed with me."" The thought of having to immerse yourself in the drug culture to do your job"
1, Red Hart Magic: This book gives insight into the history of England during one of its turblent periods. It also gives a clear look at the problems facing children in new and strange circumstances. It is great reading for early teens.
0, boring: I am a confirmed obsessive Linkin Park fan. I personally found this a bit boring. This is unauthorized so it did not have enough of the band contributing to the project.
1, White Plasti Dip: I use this product to cover my metal flower baskets that hang in my garden. I wish that it covered better and I didn't have to spray so many coats. Very time-consuming and uses product up quickly. However
1, Outdoor thermometer: The Thermometer itself seems to be a good product
1, outdoor thermometer: pleased with the size of the numbers....easy to read and the accuracy of the temp is reasonabley close to weather reports.
0, it stopped working accurately!!!: I had one similar for many years that was accurate until someone's dog jumped up and knocked if off the fence breaking it. I bought this to replace it
0, Disappointed: I ordered this thermometer as a gift for my mom and didn't even give it too her. It felt flimsy and cheap.
1, Misunderstood?: I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film
0, a real piece of junk: This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful
0, Worst mop ever!: It doesn't pick up the grime just moves it around...you think you get quality when buying a trusted name such as Mr. Clean. I can't believe this is on shelves...
0, SUCKS! SPONGE WONT STAY ON!: This product sucks. The sponge that pops in really easily also POPS BACK OUT even more easily.Basically you get a mope handle that assembles fairly easily and no mop to go with it.
1, Again I have the movie/book/and tape series...use them in class: The first time I read this I knew this was perfect for teacher
1," ""A Voice Many Seek but Few Ever Hear"": I first came across the works of Denis Waitley in late 1996"
0, The Psychology of Winning: Your ad made it look like I was purchasing the actual book
1, cd review: The classic Oscar Peterson Trio makes jazz music like no other and the quality of this re-mastering is exceptional. As an audiophile I can't recommend this cd highly enough. It has become one of my reference cd's. The opening cut has some of the best recorded bass I've ever heard and the other instruments are equally well represented. Buy and enjoy.
0," really for dummies...: It was my first ""for dummies"" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free. I gave it two stars because the book actually helps a small tiny bit contrary to its size.I recommend instead ""Alfred's Group Piano for Adults"" it's much better but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there."
0, Look elsewhere.: Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano
0, Who's the Dummy?: I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke
0, Worse remake than Planet of the Apes
1, tremendous!!!: Just go see it!! Art for the sake of art. please ignore sierocks review...the message of the film is beyond him!!
0, Silly and Too Dramatic: I love the other films Peter Jackson has made. The best is Heavenly Creatures
1, Spectacular!: Peter Jackson takes the metaphor
1, Great But Not Quite Five Stars: This movie was excellent. It borrows a lot from the original with incredible special effects and amazing recreations of 1931 New York! King Kong finally moves like a real gorilla and the destruction that gets wrecked throughout the movie is very convincing! The natives of this movie look like something out of the Exorcist although there was a tribute to the original natives during the scene where Kong is displayed to the New York public at the theater.There are a lot more dinousaurs in this one including a lot of prehistoric insect creatures that look convincingly real. I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen. I am sure people being introduced to Kong for the first time will love it!
0, King Kong & Bionic Woman: Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises
1, Kong
1, Best King Kong yet: I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white. But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects. The dinosaur fights were excellent. I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl. She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually. Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island. He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature. He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism. I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm. The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one. However I still loved this movie.
1, KING BONG !: Great movie in HD. Almost as good as the theater. But I had to go to a freinds house to watch it because it wouldnt play (obviously) on my standard DVD player nor (curiously) my Bluray player hmmmmmmmm.... You should probably mention that in the HD descriptions
0, Visually stunning. But a terriable movie: BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black
0, Too much of a CGI fest: Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.The bugs
0, Over-Rated
1, AN INSTANT CLASSIC!: This was incredible. I cannot wait for this to come on DVD. I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
1, Fun but not Classic: Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action. On bluray it pops and u have yourself a fun popcorn movie.
0, Largely Irrelevant Scholasticism: After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general
0," Doesn't work: I plugged it in to my machine. Windows made ""Chirp"" sound it makes when I plug in a flash drive"
1, The BEST bread flour I have ever used!: The 50 lbs bag arrived in just a few days.. $4.95 shipping is unbeatable. I bagged it n 1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour
1, I love him: IT WAS CCCCCRACK!!!i love him and the album i think that it was betta lyrically then from me to u~but i love santana and the whole movement ever since it start i loved cam back when he was with mase so i am a dipset fan but really its good
0, Juelz should be missing his tongue: Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs
1, MUST HAVE!: Awsome movie! Colorful! Entertaining! Funny and Sad! You will never get tired watching it over and over again!
1, It's A Wonderful Life: This is an awesome and timeless classic for the entire family. Just when you think you're life isn't going so well
1," One of the Greatest Christmastime Movies of All Time!: I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was 10 years old. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are two of the greatest actors that ever lived! My sister and I love to sing along with the ""Sisters"" song. (Speaking of which"
1, White Christmas DVD: My mom and I would watch this movie every year when I was growing up. It just did not seem like Christmas until we watched White Christmas.
0, Terrible transfer: bad color alignment and often audio sync issues.: Unfortunately the DVD I purchased is worse than my aging VHS copy of this wonderful film. The color on this copy is out of alignment
1, One of the best Christmas movies: One of the best Christmas movies. Our family has been decorating our Christmas Trees for over 20 years
1, My favorite holiday movie: Such a deal getting it as a digital download. It will always be available when I need it! doesn't clutter up the DVD shelf for the remaining 11 months of the year.
1, Great Classic!: A must-see for the Christmas season! I love Rosemary Clooney. Danny Kaye is wonderful in this movie - fun music.
1, good movie: I havent seen this one yet but my wife says its a good one so I bought it on her behalf. thank you amazon
0, The critics are right -- this movie isn't very good.: This is a subtle pro-war film that has nothing to do with Christmas. I can't believe Irving Berlin himself liked it. There are only a few things that make it worth watching. (1) Grady Sutton
1, It's a Wonderful Life: A Christmas classic. All these years later
1, good movie: Loved the movie I haden't see it for at least 20 years and it still managed to entertain and delite me

0, There is a useful part: Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially
0, QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS: I recently purchased the Maxxima 2 LED Night Light with White Lens (Pack of 2)
1, Human Resource Management: The book was in great condition and the delivery was timely. I am completely satisified.
1, This game is soooooo AWESOME!!!!!!!: I got this game for christmas. It was actually the only computer game I got for christmas. What I like to do is mix dif herbivores in the same exhibit (e.g. Savannah herbivores together). You get higher ratings from the guests if you do it that way. Another game I recommend is The Hobbit. Except you fight the animals instead of taking care of them. All in all
1, Springfield 13 Inch Thermometer: Nice and easy to read from a distance. Very lightweight. It does what it is advertised to do.
1," Like the Springfield Thermometer: We've only been using it for a few weeks at a school but it seems like it's pretty close to the correct temperature that another thermometer I have reads. I like how it has the humidity so you can figure out the ""feels like"" temperature and having the wind chill reading is good too."
0, Buy a mercury Thermo for accuracy ...: This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator
0, Lame: I really hate when a writer true to write a military based book with little to no research
0, Not very complete. Too many ActiveX controls missing.: Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
1, malts for my son: Just the right mallets at a good price. Could not find any locally so Amazon was the next best place to easily find them.
1, Reflective Tape: The product seems to work as suggested! I received it on time and I'm very happy with it's application.Thankschris
1, Safety first... and second...: Great product. Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well.
0," It just wouldn't run: My hw is overkill for the game. It seemed to install just fine. And then it just wouldn't run. Click on the icon and nothing happened. There was no help anywhere for it. I checked all the ""fixes"" online and nothing worked. I've worked for VAR's troubleshooting PC's for a living and I couldn't get it to run. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
0, Don't bother unless you prefer single player: If you enjoy single player only
0, Bad graphics: I still play AOE 1 because the graphics are so simple it doesnt hert your eyes to play it for hours. I didnt like the graphics in AOE 2
0, Age of Empires III: We were never able to use the game
0," Not ready for prime time: I have a 4 GHz machine with 2 Mb of RAM and GeForce4 graphics card. I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution. But this game runs so slowly that it is unplayable -- even at the default screen resolution (1024x800).That resolution is another problem. I have a 21"" plasma monitor so anything less than 1600x1200 resolution is blurry. When I tried to use 1600x1200 it was so slow that I thought it had crashed.In addition the screen scrolling is almost impossible to use because it is so jerky and delayed."
0, Age of Empires III: I can not get it to work on my windows XP or Windows 7 machines. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
0, Just a big let down: I've loved AOE since the first installment and had been looking forward to AOE 3 for years. Unfortunately it turns out to be a huge dissapointment. Everyone else has mentioned the bugs and ridiculous system requirements to get the game working properly but these aside
1," Great small space BBQ!: This grill is great for small spaces. We live in a condo in NYC and it is perfect for the tiny area we get to call our ""patio"". We love to grill and this gives us delicious dinners without taking up cruical square footage. Very even heat"
1, Long term winner!: I have just sold my Patio Caddy after 10 YEARS! I worked famously during that entire time and it still works as good as it did when it was new. The electronic ignition never failed to work. And CharBroil still sells them. Does that tell you something? We only sold it because we wanted a larger unit
1, Can't live without it!: I've owned the same Patio Caddie for over 10 years now! It grills beautifully over clay briquettes
1," IGBY- the european version: The soundtrack album is actualy a european version where the music in the movie is slightly different. It's an excellent compilation including Travis`version of ""the weight"" and europe's most recent rock breakout ""underwater circus""! Higly recommendable."
1," Windows 98 Annoyances: This is the first ""Tech manual"" that I have read from cover to cover. It is jammed packed with helpful hints and fixes for Windows 98. Whenever the people at work have a question about Windows 98 we delve into Windows 98 Annoyances and lo-and-behold there is the answer. I have also recommended it to the ZDU SmartPlanet Class I am currently enrolled in. Windows 98 Installation and Support Part I. This book is a must for the beginner and even the intermediate Windows user."
0, The Dutiful Rake: Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here
1, Good Choice of Episodes: I would love to see this whole series on DVD
1, Flour: The flour was good
1, House version of Prince: Jamie is one of the best house artist short of Larry Heard
1, very good debut: This is a very relaxed but also danceable soul album. Jamie has a wonderful smooth voice. He is accompanied by Kym Sims and Chantay Savage on this album. It's a very good and smooth album
0, Bad Mug: I got this and loved the ergonomics. Great feel
1," Rare and curious relic: Spade Cooley was not your typical B Western ""hero"". The cowboy movies where he played the lead character seemed like a parody or even a satirical commentary (intentionally or not) on B singing cowboys of that period. This Alpha DVD contains two of his rare three movies where he played lead. Alpha obtained somewhat passable to good copies of prints and released these in DVD. Despite all"
0, Spade digs a hole: This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley
0, very disapointed: I realize that this isn't an expensive item by any means
1, ***** You want to be MCSE
1, great introduction and reveiw of topics: At this point I have only read the TCP/IP and IIS 4.0 sections
1, blast from the past: Uncertain at first but just wanted see how it went. For those who know the Grand Canyon must be fascinating. I would think it a must-have for those exploring this area.
1, Hey: Hey
1, 20 minutes to warm up your day!: This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!Breathwork is a focus throughout
0, Great Initially
0, 2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!: Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However
0, Electric is nice
0, Does not sear steaks: This grill will work only as a baker and not as a hot grill that will sear steaks. It preheats after 30 minutes to about 375 degrees and the temperature drops significantly when meat is added. This is certainly not the temperature published in the manual. It is not satisfactory for my needs.
1, the best grill that i own: I own three bbq grills .A propane grillcharcol grill and the electric patio caddie.The patio caddie which I use on my deck has forced the other two grills into storage.The electric grill heats up to about 700 degrees in 15 to 20 minutes and cooks burgers in 10 minutes franks in 8 minutes and chicken in about 18 minutes.It is easy to assemble and use.It is by far the best piece of hardware that I have ever bbq'ed on.ps. I intend to use this grill throughout the winter for tailgate parties at home.
0, Total Waste Of My Money: When new
0, DON'T BUY: I've had this grill for a little over a year. I paid $189 for it. It worked like a champ for ONE SUMMER
0, lousy design...: I am now on my 3rd Char-Broil patio caddie! They've each lasted 2 years and then the plastic control knob melts! What kind of design do they have? Then again
0, Awkward start: Ocean Colour Scene are absolutely brilliant. It is amazing to me that they are virtually unknown here in the States. They write
1, Great compressor!: This is a great compressor
1, Great music performed extraordinarily well: My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin
1, Hot stuff -- an inspiration for writers!: This is an excellent book about a man who knows who he is
0, Disappointing: This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight
1, Reading ON FIRE not a waste of time: ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer
1, Landscape of the Heart: WINTER PASSING is visually beautiful with skillful acting and slow-paced story telling. The lives portrayed are barren as a winter landscape
1, Uplifting and Inspirational!: I purchased the CD as a means of introduction for our kids to christian music. The worship songs are upbeat and spiritually uplifting. Its a fantastic CD and I recommended it highly. It would make a great addition to your current musical collection and an even better gift to a friend. I love it!
1, SIRIUS - SIGNAL KIT: I had problems with indoor receptions with Sirius boom box external antenna so I bought this. It works very well so now I have excellent reception indoors. I installed it with the splitter for standard Satellite not HD and it works well this way I don't know how well it would affect HD reception for the TV if at all. I am very pleased with this unit.
1, This is the best book in the world: Mr. Poppers Penguin is the best book. The author is Richard and Florence Atwater. This is a Newbery Honor book. It is great for all ages because it is the funniest book in the world. My favorite part is when the penguins live in the freezer. The characters are Mr. Popper
1, Wonderful Book: I took a University class were The Story of Judaism
1, What can I say?: This was a GREAT find. First bought the vinyl back in the 80's and snagged the disc quite some time ago. Ray signed the cover in 2002 @ the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland
1, Sturdy grater: This product took a while coming
0, When in trouble
0, Disappointing: I read a lot of thrillers
1," BEST CD I BOUGHT ALL YEAR!: The review that prompted me to buy this CD called it ""an embarassment of riches"" and it is an understatement.Every song is a joy. During the first listen I waited eagerly when the changer switched to the next tune. You never know what is going to greet you next. Big band"
0, worth product i never got from Amazon website before: i ordered this book on june 14
1, perfect: Perfect on my Sony blu-ray
1, Lauras Review!! GO ME: well...I havent seen this movie in a while but its one of my favourite movies of all time...Its great! The songs are amazing
1, Classic Tim Burton: What can I say
1, Nightmare before Christmas: Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie
1, My favorite movie: This is a great movie with incredible stop motion animation. The story is fantastic
0, nightmare before christmas: Let me start by saying it took over 5 weeks to deliver
1, Very Happy with purchase.: The item was the same as what it was described as. Great value for the money with the Special Edition!
1, Twisted
1, Great movie great condition: Movie arrived before estimated day and is in great shape for being used. Will use this company for my dvd needs in the future.
1, A charming Mexican Romantic Comedy: Anyone who has any familarity with Mexican culture will immediately identify with this movie. The son who does his mother's bidding no matter what. The young woman who marries to escape the constrictions of the family. The closeted nature of gay life in Mexico. The mother who works to make sure her son is happy as well as presents the proper appearance in society. Someone from the United States might wonder what all the fuss is about. But the movie touches on the Mexican world view and gay people in a compassionate manner for the time. A good training manual for any gringo who decides to involve himself with a Mexican male.
0, Terrible product quality and service: Ordered a 2 pack
1, So far
0, Imac Crap: This book is useless. Anyone with 10 minutes may sit at an Apple computer and learn more hands on than the hour or two wasted reading this book. The other reviews here re: iMac Fast and Easy are very misleading... probably written by someone with interests other than yours.
0, Yuck!: a spaghetti western at its worst. Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was. Thankfully
0, A Mess: I have read this book cover to cover (with my highlighter and pencil at the ready) and I've never been more frustrated in all my life. I work with Word everyday and am looking to automate documents and I can make no sense out of any of it. (Of course
0, It was alright...: While listening to Sleepy Brown's album
0, didn't work for me: used about 3 of these over a two year period
0, Terrible: How did this product even get 1 good review? Terrible
0, Don't catch Yellow Jackets: Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
1, Always works: I am big fan of Irwin Naturals Ginkgo and been using it for years. My wife uses a lot of there brands as well.
0, Not a good everyday supplement: I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great
0, ugh!: The plot is corny and unrealistic. The characters couldn't be more transparent if they were glass. Definitely a waste of time...unless you want to get a few good laughs at the author's unintentionally humorous style.
0, no: I didn't like this book because it was as true to life as advertised on the back of the book. I think agent Night's character should learn to talk like a real person.
1, Lust for Danger blew me away!: I was thrilled with this book! My only regret was that it ended. Fast-paced
1," Top notch movie: Have enjoyed this movie for years. Don`t know why I had not bought it before.The Sweeny Todd performance is the greatest.Sure beats ""Memories"" from Cats."
0, Pretty Lame: I thought this movie was pretty bad. It was SO easy to predict. Liv Tyler's role was so small
0, Good story idea
0, Garbage: Poor acting all around
1, I don't care I enjoyed this movie!: Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan
1, Extra Questions for the Test!: This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series.
1, I'm learning a lot!!: I really didn't even use the cd's for two weeks
0, This is a waste of money: This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it
0, [aweful]: This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read
1, Nice
0, Dreadful: Bought this item based on the positive reviews. I bought 3 and followed the directions. Not only did this trap not catch any flies
0, Works well
1, These are great fly traps!: THis is the second order of these fly traps. We tried a locally available fly trap after the first order was completely full of flies but the other brand just didn't do the job so we reordered these to use in our horse barn. These are WONDERFUL. Within minutes of hanging them
1, Highly Recommend: This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat
0, Either I've attracted Highly Evolved Flies
0, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!: We had a cook out in our back yard and we hung this up on the deck about 5 feet away from the table and not one fly went for this thing as they were all in our food!! As soon as we cleared the food from the table
1, Fly control: This thing is amazing
1," The one that Works: I purchased this product last Fall on a close out sale at a huge national retailer. It worked perfectly. This year I returned to the same retailer in July and they had sold out of the Rescue Brand Fly Traps and didn't plan on restocking until next year. They talked me into purchasing another brand. Needless to say the other brand didn't work. We live next to a cattle pasture and the flies are outrageous near our home. I hung the ""other"" brand fly trap on the fence between the pasture and my driveway and a week later there were a few flies in the trap. I ordered the Rescue Brand Fly Trap from Amazon and hung 3 of them on the same fence. 3 days later I had to replace the Rescue Brand TrapsRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trapbecause they were FULL OF FLIES. I will not use another brand trap because I am not a wealthy person and cannot waste money. The Rescue brand Fly is the one that works. Don't waste your time or money with any other brand."
0," First 3 songs good then...a little disapoointing: When I head ""Shining Light"" I thought this was going to be real find. When I bought this CD"
0, OUTRAGEOUS price!: Why are they so expensive here? At least twice the price that they normally are at a drugstore! I love Amazon
1, One of the best entertainment book: I have read many
1, ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF THE 90'S!: THIS IS BY FAR MIKE MYER'S BEST MOVIE! DANA CARVEY AND MYERS LIGHT UP THE SCREEN LIKE NO OTHER COUPLE. THE SCRIPT IS BRILLIANT FUNNY AND COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE. WHAT DO I MEAN? AFTER YOU SEE THIS FILM YOU PICK UP LINES LIKE EXSQUEEZE ME? AND BAKING POWDER? GET IT? ANYWAY
1, Squeeze me? Baking Powder?: If you grew up watching Mike Myers on SNL
1, AGE3: I have been a fan of this series from the beginning and it has only gotten better with time and later versions. The latest version takes place in a time period with great significance and has always drawn me in. The graphics are great
0, There's no commentary
1," An apt title for retro-loving film buffs: This is a great collection of Burlesque shorts. The ""features"" are not entirely worth watching. Every element of the classic grindhouse atmosphere is recorded--the gritty backdrops"
0, B at best: I did not make it very far through this movie. Even if you think Jenny is attractive (she's not) then you still shouldn't watch this movie. Thankfully amazon prime gives it to us for free.
0, Dreadfully Unfunny: This was a movie recommended to me by a friend. I turned it off after seeing a fish imbedded in the lower orifice of one of Jenny's dates. He yells
1, if u have an off beat sense of humor you'll love it!: In this movie jenny mccarthy stars as rebecca who is dating a typical model who is more in love with himself then her. This movie is not for people who find typical things funny. Everything from her break down on the hollywood strip to finding her boyfriend cheating on her are things that women encounter. I mean the whole part where she goes richard my richard and then starts to cry and then stops calms herself then thinks about the situation again. classic. ive done that although not on the street. and when she walks in on her boyfriend and doesnt say anything my friend did the same thing. everyone has that white ghetto friend. everyone has that ditsy friend. all the stereotypes were done to the extreme and thats what makes it so great and really funny. you cant take this movie seriously and you shouldnt try to. Just enjoy it!
0, terrible: Why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was on the first page of popular picks. It was beyond bad.
0, Aren't there any negative stars?: This was a total waste of time. Bad acting
0, pure cra*: This is the first movie review I have ever provided and I write it only to save any other person out there a bit of your life. Skip this movie
1, Do yourself a favor.... BUY IT!!!!!: I'm owned this cd since it came out and all I can hear is Dave Tregunna kick ass basslines
0, worth a rent
0," Poor anti-war movie: I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since ""Mosquito Coast"" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad"
1, Pretty Good: I have the Night Before Halloween so I decided to give this book a try. It starts off very good. It fell off to me toward the middle. But
1, Children loved it!: We heard about this book and bought it for our grandchildren
1," Cute: I like how this book is realistic yet kid friendly. My 3 yr old can relate to almost every page and it teaches him a few new words like ""needles"" on the tree and ""sugar plum"" to which he always calls out it's candy! And he laughs when the baby pee pees on Santa. He also likes when the girl says ""bad kitty"" because our pets are always knocking down ornaments"
1, Loved it: Interesting period piece. Well written... this manuscript won an international competition by Wallace publishing (Chicago) as well as a $10
0, bad experience: I thought i was getting a dvd i could view in the USA!Unfortunately it was for viewing in China!I was told i would have to pay for shipping to send it back
1, Excellent Read: I have read this book at least 2 times in the past few months - it is an easy
1, First Buy: At least this on played on my dvd unlike S2. Really enjoy this series so glad I purchased the series so I can watch it whenever I want to.
0," Build Your Own Pentium III PC: As with most of the ""build your own"" books on the market"
0," Not really that great.: Bought this and ""Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant""After a week this Jar had about 50 flies in it.The other"
0, Not as effective as had hoped... and it REEKS!!!!!: We leave a bowl of food out for our outdoor cats
0, do not buy: Green top does not hold the weight of the water well.Hung mine and yes the lid was on tight.Next thing it fell from green top and was all on the floor.Green plastic top does not hold weight of water at all.
1, Underrated blues/rock band compels musicianship to new level: Much in the spirit of Zeppelin
1, HILARIOUS: IF YOU LIKE PHYSICAL HUMOR AND STEVE CARRELL
0," DIGTAL COPY WILL NOT WORK: A warning that the Digital Copy disc that comes with this Blu-Ray set will no longer work. It ""expired"" in December 2009 and can no longer be accessed. Just something that should be noted"
1, Funnier than expected: I was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie. The inclusion of The Rock helped decrease the overall dorkie-ness. Lots of fun and right up there with the Austin Powers movies.The Blu-Ray copy looked AMAZING. I did not see a copy of the regular DVD version so I have no real comparison but that aside
0, Ha-Ha
1, Can't be beat: I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan
0, taking stupid to a new hight: this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies
0, Stupid: How this movie is getting such good ratings is beyond me.It just goes to show that people will like anything these days.People are such simpletons that I guess doesn't take much to amuse them.This movie is so stupid and no I am not comparing it to the tv show
0, Plain old Boring!: I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's
1, Delicious!!: I bought this Thai Green Curry paste to cook a Thai dish I'd seen made on of the cooking shows. It turned out PERFECT. I almost make that dish weekly now. Can't live without my Mae Ploy!
1, Spicey: This is real potent. It doesn't take a lot to make it firey. This tub should last a long time
0, A waste of talent: This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid. It is so funny to watch how horrible the movie is. Do not buy it
1, WOwzeRs: I'm not usually a rock music person. I saw these guys on the shelf at a music store. so when i got home i downloaded one of the songs. I fell in love. I had to buy it. and so
0, Grow some balls
0," ""I think they lost their balls"": This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks! If you listen to it"
0, Why are they compared to Good Charlotte?: They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different
0, Punk? yeah right: Little preppy kids
1, Best CD Around: When I got this CD I don't know what I expected
1, Rick: I think all of the people who think Simple Plans album sucks can lick my balls because there is not one song that is not good on the Cd. I think simple plan did a great job making the album and everyone who thiks it sucks can lick my ballsack
0, THIS IS COOL: oh my god I love this band
0, STay away from all pop/punk at all costs!: Now i decided to review this rancid cd
1, Yeah
1, Simple Plan Rocks: If youre into bands like Good Charlotte
0, Man
0," I wrote a poem on this band: Simple PlanYou say your punkThat is bull $h!tYou sang ""I Don't Want To Think About You""Those Lyrics Connected To Me Cause That Is How I Feel About YouAll Who ANswer No To If This Review Is HelpfulCan Lick My....HandIf You Like ThemThen You Go To School Wearing Abercrombie and Spend Hundreds of Dollars Say Your Punk and The Only Ones That Agree With You Are Your Immature Poser FriendsSnoogans!Love"
0, REALLY BAD...: it's completelly embarassing the posture of the guys from simple plan....they must be 30 years old men
1, Simple Plan Rocks: I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer
0, badd: hprrible punk emo sellouts
0, THIS is What is Wrong with Music of Today: I don't have much to say but bands like this have no originality. I'm sick and tired of hearing pop punk emo whining bands that all copy off of each other doing the same old crap and making albums complaining about girls and whatever else. I'll admit
0, Well..: Well
0, Sucks: See my review of their live cd.And god
0, No balls... no helmets... just pads!: Maxi pads that is! I saw a poster of these posers
0, *yawn*: It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good
0, Killing Rock and Roll: Many analogies fly
0, no pads
0, I HATE WANNABES!!!!!: i absulootly h@ wanabes they make me sick! ppl think their punk if they buy th@ sh*t from hottopic and listen to simple plan and other sh*t! it's the same evrywhere
0, And this cd is the worst one ever: You know it's a sad day for punk rock when 12 year old preppy girls flock to the NFG simple plan concerts. Why does punk rock suck so bad now? This cd is the epitomy of [bad] punk rock. If you want to listen to good punk/emo go buy Les Savy Fav ...
1, Another pop-punk band: Simple Plan is anothe pop-punk band. This CD is pretty kick ass. They've given the guys a hard time with the IMMATURE stuff but they're trying crits! I got the record as a present and I really liked it although I wasn't planning to buy it. The guys are growin up and I'm sure critics are gonna shut up on their next album.Simple Plan is simple...if your a teenager and y u?re trying to write up a song then you?d probably come up with something like one of SP?s songs. The bonus (Grow Up) and hidden (Christmas) tracks are really good and probably they?re the songs you could relate to the most.I would really reccommend this album to anyone who likes GC
0," Ugggghhhhh...: The same rehashed Pop/Punk thats been used over and over again. Flavor of the week guaranteed. Let them have their moment in the sun. Let the little kiddies call themselves ""punk"". Let them have a taste of the rock star life style"
1, Simple Plan Rules Canadian acts: I love Simple Plan adn i love this new album! all of the songs are really fun and easy to sing along with. It's constantly in my CD player and i take it with me every where. The boys are so talented at their insturments and I love Pierre's voice! This CD is definitly one to buy!
1, Sad lyrics with happy music... oddly nice.: Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing
1," Such a GREAT CD!! I love it!: I really love this CD! It is more ""poppish-punk"" rather than true punk rock"
0, Worst...band...ever: Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit. They have to be the worst band ever. Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band. Not original at all. Overall this album is a -100
0, Garbage at it's finest: This album is the prime example of what really bad pop is capable of. Now
1, love it accept for one thing: Great value for the price..... very comfortable and easy to use. The one thing I find which causes some discomfort is the foot cushioning mechanism. Being that you are actually hanging by your feet in full vertical
1, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
0, inversion table: junk you get what you pay for. you better make sure someone is with you even if youve been on one before. im 5ft. 7 and i have to set it at over 6ft. to be able to get back up.that probably wouldnt be so bad but now you are not lined up with the back so its very uncomfortable. its a wonder they havnt been sued yet. also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable. im sorry i tried to go cheap. i was better off going to sports authority for 200. i got a reebock that i can return much more easily if i dont like it. im going to try and give no stars as its not worth 1 star but i already put it in and i dont know if i can change it.
1," Worth every minute I spent on it: Get the facts straight from the source. The author is convinced that MS SQL is the best thing since sliced bread and that fact alone makes you want to keep reading. His positive and professional attitude puts the reader in the right mood to absorb and learn. He's not the ""neutral observer"" kind of author usually encountered (he's a member of the development team).Simply put"
0, Works as a webcam but not as a digital camera: It's a cute little thing
1, Love Chick Corea and Flora Purim Together: I used to listen to What Game Shall We Play Today back in 1977. I never knew the name of the song or the amazing singer with the latin accent. After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years
1, o.k. terrific: it's absolutely happening here. the gangmembers will probably be the evildoers' new police force
1, Amazing!: I too worked for Wolff New Media writing the NetBooks. Michael Wolff struck me as one of those fairly arrogant
0, Only read if want to read everything available on net biz: This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses
1, ~ The Best of the Star Trek movies~: The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .
0, Must have for Trek colletors
0, Not a good start for the films: Someone
1, Excellent...the VI Bible: I have used this book at my workplace for some time
1, Great non toxic product to reduce fly populations: Rescue FTA Fly Trap Attractant works great. Using new attractant in the reusable bottle is much more economical than the disposable traps. While there is a little odor close to the bottle
1, Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it: Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top
1, Great History Reading: I read this book for a college history course. It is a great book to read if you are interested in understanding the effects of world war Ii on different people. If you are not open to New ideas about history
1, Great book: I received this book as a gift
0, Poor Product: First time i used this mop
1, This Book is Truly An Eye Opener: I would recommend this book for All to read. It has truly changed my life for the better. I wanted to be closer to God and this book helped me connect with the higher power on a deeper level. This book has given me my faith back and has transformed my thinking and i am grateful that Dr. Stanley wrote this great book for those of us that are looking for answers to so many of life's questions. If you don't already have this book please get it. You will not be disappointed. I have a new way of looking at life and a new relationship with my creator.
1, A Fresh Look...: This book was wonderful. It gave new and practical insight into how we can truly hear from God. Stanley captures scriptural doctrine into every day practices that every Christian can and should implement.
0, Regretful: So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting
1, A Horror Treat for the Spooky season: A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts
0, Disorganized
1," TCL/TK in A Nutshell: ""TCL/TK in A Nutshell"" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail. It's not for novices"
1, everything went as expected: Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
1, Roses: I love romance novels that are clean
1, Album Good For a Stupid Movie: I love this album. Don't scare me none is a good honest song. The movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's the reason JM hasn't done anything in the movies since.
0, Does not work buy something else: I purchased 3 traps and this was one of the three. Out of the three different traps this has caught one and I say one yellowjack in a week. The others have had to be emptied at least once...you do the math.
0, Does not work as effectivly as advertised: Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.
0, Rescue My Wallet: Useless
1, The Gladiator: I first saw this movie when it came out fifteen or twenty years ago and got it on video. I have been trying to get it on DVD for years
1, legends at work: listening to roy hargrove and karl denson play is as exciting as joe henderson/lee morgon or miles an trane. nuff said

0, Great movie; horrible DVD: The movie is great but if you're buying it to own a high-quality
1, Over 120 Inspirational Recipes: Presented by a renowned Thai restaurateur
0, Quality of DVD stincks: I love the original series but feel cheeted. There were episodes that I remember that were not included. Mostly though the quality control in these DVD's is realy bad. My father owns a set
1, where's Cy??: I wouldn't call this a complete set. Does anyone remember the episode where Starbuck and the cylon are stranded on a planet
1, Im buying this set!!!!!: Battlestar Galactica is my favorite all time show!Frack!I know alot of people are saying bad things about Galactica.Its All talk and it sounds like some of ya are just jealous!Battlestar Galactica has everything! Awesome music its better than star wars!Great special effects the vipers are so cool!Beautiful cast{Sheba shes nice and pretty
0, Terrible: Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created
0, Ohhh
0, To be avoided: If you are a begginer looking for information on growing MJ or a more experienced grower requiring ideas then you will do very well to avoid this book. The material is poorly laid out
0, Disappointed: I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product
0, TERRIBLE!: Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement. Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car...I should have known better! Avoid this one! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned.
0, DISAPPOINTING: Looked good out of the box. However
0, You get what you pay for: For the money
0, worth it for the price: the ratchet is too weak. not even able take off one nut before it broke. need to shop for another one now.
0, Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in my life: I know this is only 10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful. But this beats all standards of a poorly made product. The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place. The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished. Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe. A simple 3/8 to 1/4 adapter would have sufficed
0, For display only: I decided to buy this because I needed to do an oil change on my car. After two minutes of using it the wrench it got stuck and never worked again. You can actually tell it is bad quality just by turning it by hand. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone (not even for a small job). The item is on its way back for a full refund thanks to Amazon great customer service. Lesson learned
1, Doesn't make you an expert
0, Quick Shot?: Thomas M. Thomas and his co-authors did a very poor job this time. When I studied for the BCMSN exam
1, One of my favorite CDs: This CD is full of bouncy
1, Dora's reviews: My husband and I watch this movie a lot. It is funny. I had never heard of this movie but I am glad I purchased it. I recommend it to anyone.
0," Disappointed child and mama!: My 20-month old son loves Road Construction Ahead and many other videos that focus on earth-moving equipment and ""machines"""
1, Remarkable memoir
0, NOT the BEST from the BEST: The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great. (I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part.) Everyone in the family
0, This has got to be the worst batman movie ever.: Batman Returns is just plain sick at times. The Penguin
0, .: Tim Burton's worst movie
1, Batman: Returns
1," ""Gentlemen"
1, The best Batman!: If you haven't seen it
0, It;s too Dark: I don't what I disliked about this movie the most. The fact that Gothom City looks like a war zone
0, Eeeyew!: This movie is disgusting. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and it seems the sole purpose of Danny Devito's Penguin is to be gross. At least the original Batman movie had some wit and decent music. Don't waste your time with this worthless use of videotape.
1," The best BATMAN ever!!!!!: Tim Burton's direction shines in this picture. It's perfect. ""Batman Returns"" is dark and mysterious the way it should be. The series needs to return to these dark roots again; take the neon off the batmobile"
1, Great book: This is a great book
0, One man's biography: I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time.
0, Not enjoyable: The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film. Unfortunately
0, April's Shower: It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.
1, depends: This is a good book if you just want to read about what grace Slick did outside of Airplane and why she decided to do it. It isnt one of those books which documents every single date of release of album and what happened within the record company and how it was marketed in the nation etc.... Those books are good but to me this is a nice change to very complicated books
0," A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock.: Where did Grace find this ""writer"" to co-author her biography? What could have been a terrific and insightful look at one of rock and roll's greatest and most rebellious icons instead reads like entries from a diary. Poorly sequenced and unimagitively written"
0, Disappointing: Considering the life she's led I would have expected more from Slick's autobiography. A big yawn--I skimmed through the last 200 pages.
1, This book had a lovely romantic twist to it!:): I am not a great fan of Mrs. Alcott
1, Astral Projection at their finest: Astral Projection has been making the greatest trance for years and years. And its great to see that after more than 5 years
0, Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money: I was really disappointed by this DVD. My acupuncturist had recommended that I try a Rodney Yee video
0, Backcare Yoga for Beginners: This product is garbage and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves even allowing it to be sold on line to unsuspecting customers.
1, Terrific purchase: Beautiful Sateen sheet set. Price was great and quality is above average. Will definitely purchase from this merchant for all my bedding needs. Great seller!!!
0, Not much here: I was dissapointed in this little book. It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention. Not much here in terms of learning - Rumsfeld is pretty command and control.
1, Krames Provides a Quality Read on Rumsfeld: I liked the way the book was organized. It distills Rumsfeld into an understandable person with recognizable leadership principles and skills. You can see why he has been successful and even appreciate his no-nonsense approach. A good quick read on a unique individual.
0, Pointless: What a waste of money! She loves the life she didn't expect? Page after pages sounds more like she's praying for a man to come along and save her. Let's all just bide our time until a man comes along. I don't fault her for wanted to get married
0, disappointing: I was expecting so much more after _Dawn and this book wasa disappointment. I know many people who never bothered toread the last book in the series because this one lefta bad taste in their mouths.The characters just didn't connect
1," Love it! Love It! Love It!: Love it! Love It! Love It! ""The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit"" by Thomas Lucier is very informative and a must read for anyone interested in this type of real estate investing. Mr. Lucier tells in detail how to negotiate with homeowners in trouble"

1, Just great!: I heard Van Hunt on NPR and immediately ordered the CD. In his interview with Travis Smiley
1, Good book to understand USA for an european: After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book. It has given me the oportunity to understand a lot of your spirit. His openminded vision is one I have not seen so often over your interesting nation
1," One of the Best Travel Books Ever Written: I just finished the book and it was a fantastic read. It was a fairly ""light"" book"
1, Traveling: I liked some of his other works better
0, This book deserves less than one star: This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life
0, torture!!: This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to
1, As timely now as when released...: This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation
0," Booklet NOT included!!!!!!! Paramount execs are tightwads.: Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.After ""re""-releasing all 5 movies in its ""special edition"" format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular ""no extras"" format"
1, Fine Trek: Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films
1, The Final Journey: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is probably the most entertaining film of the Star Trek franchise. Released in 1991
1, Not the best Star Trek ever but Great Price: Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days
1," The voyage home is the best: I liked all three movies but it wasn't until they got to ""The search for Spock"" that they got the editing right on the Star Trek movies. Very intertaining though."
1, Wierd but interesting: Attila was an interesting yet strange book. The character goes through a mixture of complex reality mixed with hallucinations. I specially enjoyed Chapter 5.
1, Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine
0, Not worth reading!: Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages. Found the essays not especially well written and am looking forward to discussing it with our book review group to see if they can actually shed some light on the issues. Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep.

1, Folding Chair Reviewed: These chairs are so comfortable that we move them from the deck to the inside of the house to watch T.V.......and so easily moved that they go back out again in the morning!
1, Uniquely Superb: The Cyclical Serpent provides and excellent review of the wisdom of the ages and how they are relevant and to
1, Great binoculars
1, Good Packaging: Good packaging
1, this is a quality product
1, Big Bang for the Buck: I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew. My wife and I love them! They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision
0, Plain stupid: This book is stupid... the romance... the vampires... everything and why did she use that poem? Amelia never actually stated if these vampires are demon or not. They hold emotions of love and that doesn't make 'em demon...
1, I couldn't put it down: The minute I got this book I started it. From that time on
0, Ugh.: I picked up this book looking for something interesting to read.And I must say I was a bit jealous to find that this author is a year younger than I am and has an array of books published.But you know what? I'm no longer jealous. Because a retarded monkey could come up with better character developments and plots than Ms. Atwater-Rhodes has put in this novel.I barely got halfway through this book when I threw it across the room
0, Over Hyped: This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen
0," Horrible teenybopper fluff: ""Demon In My View"" (the title is lifted from Poe's poem ""Alone"")contains nothing of redeeming value"

0, Big Need for this Solution
0, Left hangng: Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly
1, Now this is fun....: Besides thrills
0, Do not buy this book: This book has so many mistakes it should be used as a door stop or fuel for the fireplace. I ended up referring back to inside VC++ 5.0 and looking at the COM section in that book. If you need to learn about com see gopalan sureshes web site. He give practical information on COM and CORBA.
0, what a piece of waste!: this book goes on and on and on about the same thing. the author must love to hear him self rambling in a empty space. there is no useful information in this book. if you want to learn COM and DCOM
0," I wouldn't take this book from a friend for free.: Here's a little blurb from the ""Why is COM Needed"" section:""... Each compiler produces a set of machine language instructions (binary numbers) that are designed to be fed by the operating system into the CPU of the computer in structured ways to produce program behavior...."".With gems like that early in the book"
1, Great Stuff: The reviewer was quite rough. Not every song on this CD is great
1, great album: I luckily found this cd at a used bookstore. It was a great find
1, Bunuel at his best: This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki

1, Best gundam show: I would consider this one of the best gundam series. Highly recommend if one were interested in any gundam series.
0, I got Snaked: This cable looks good
0, Assembly is a bit tricky: Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands. You have to watch out that there are different length pre-drilled holes at the different ends of the pillars. I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight

0," NOT A Learning Book: This book would have been better had it not included ""Learning"" in the title. This is not a book for learning how to program in Java. Instead"
1," no title: From the producers of ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies"
1, Pretty Good: Contrary to the other reviews
0, Don't bother!: After reading mixed reviews
0, Aurora Leigh from general books publishers: I bought this book (General Books edition) from Amazon
0, A letdown: Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic 1999 live offering
0, broke on the first use: I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name. Big mistake. The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened
1, A Real Lesson that can be applied to life: Snow White-a tale of terror isn't just a tale that is merely entertainment. This tale actually teaches you about life. It's very real
0, are you kidding me ? so much for the hype.: This movie couldn't hold our attention tonight. Painful to watch in so many ways. Gruesome
1, I became a documentarian because of this film.: After seeing this film
0, Pact With The Devil doesnt pack a punch or a hit: This movie is about a man named Louis
0, Bad book: Although there are only a few books currently discussing about the internal of JVM
0, Save your money...: This book tries to cover topics in a very abstract way. You do not get a feel for the components that make up a VI project. It barely touches on Design Time Controls. It just tells the user what these things are
0, Contents need more explanation and depth: A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end
0, This Chair is bad: It would not support 100lbs. It fell apart as soon as my hind end hit it. If your looking for an outdoors chair

0, Piss poor unoriginal mallcore: Don't waste your time buying this garbage. This band has the worst singer
0, Horrible Song: Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.
1, Good book
0, The LAst Detective Audio Book: I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book
0, Surprized: I have been a fan of Robert Crais
1, Elvis Cole is back again!: The return of Elvis Cole is well worth the wait. Robert Crais moves Elvis right into action during the first chapter. He is caring for his girlfriend's son and in just one moment the boy disappears. The ensuing search for the boy centers upon's Elvis's Vietnam memories

1, More phisolophical than technical for sure: The book provides some clues on how errors should be considered. It spends a lot of time describing the current situation in a very verbose style. OK that's fun but not very instructive (I mean
1, Bulk Soaker Hose Comparison: Fiskars ceased making bulk soaker hose in 96'. Excellent product and system using there black and yellow compression fittings. I found an online retailer that carries the same product (part #120

0, It [stinks]: How anyone could think this was scarier than the first is beyond me. It was so [weak]. Freddy was good for one movie okay
1, A great horror movie:: This is a good movie. I love the nightmare on elm street movies.The last one isn't that good though but it's okay. The older ones are the best because they deal with teens. Patricia arquette plays in this. Buy it.
0, Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz: I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures
1, An original mix!: OK
1, New Family Favorite!: I was so pleased to find this movie on DVD & at a great price! This movie was one of my most favorites as a child & now I am able to enjoy it with my fiance & kids. It is the perfect level of creepy & mystery for kids to enjoy & not end up terrified.
0, Boot Legged Product ???: The movie was like a boot legged video... NOT a Disney movie
1, A Christmas Classic: I bought this CD when it first came out and it's still my favorite after all these years. She is at her best on this CD. A winner that is sure to please!

1, Greatest movie ever: What can I say? This is my favorite movie. Don't buy it tho unless your a deep thinker that sees lots of depth in zombie movies. Enjoy!!!
0, No.: This movie makes no sense.The title character is introduced as an immoral zombie-killer

0," More of the same: Yet another movie that presents the psuedo-gospel of ""get right with God so you don't have to go to hell with all the other sinners"". If you've seen left behind"
1," Christian movie for Anyone. Plus the Rapture.: The sign of the times are all present and sooner or later the world dictator will make his debut onto the world scene. The movie ""Six"" even though it is a movie is a close representation of what it will be like in a couple of years. Six talks about the Tribulation time in where all people on this earth will have to use a mark on there right hand or forehead in order to buy and sell anything in the market. The cash society will be non-existent. This is a great movie for the Christian person and for the person who does not know Jesus Christ and who wants to"
0," continued disappointment: The author puts forth a ""New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out.'"
1, Excelent book: I received my book from within 15days insteadof 8 weeks they told me
0, THE ALBUM THAT ALMOST DESTROYED HELLOWEEN....: In this album Helloween tried something new
0, ''Why Helloween Why'': This one is nothing compare with the oder helloween albuns.Chameleon and Pink bubles don't have the real heloween music. I prefere the bands new and old albuns.
0, WORST HELLOWEEN ALBUM: Why can't people recognize the fact that after Kai Hansen left
0, Piece of junk: Helloween almost was destroyed forever after this turkey
0, Good unit except.....: As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards. Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit. Other than this major shortcoming
1, WONDERFUL ENTERTAINTMENT: Don't seek any academic insights from this book. This is a piece of pure entertainment
1, Ooooooh my Godddddddddd !!!: Like most of Betty Carter's albums
1, Excellent and forceful: The stories are of two types here -- short
0, Didn't much care for it.: I didn't much cre for this book. It had too much sex stuff and not really any stories to follow. I thought it would be a good book
0, Say
1, Lots of good Information and facts.: This book helps a lot. It teaches you how to train
0, bad to the bone: this movie sucked
1," ""I'll get you my pretty and your little soul too"": I loved this Nightmare film"
0, Is Freddy dead yet?: Just a typical Freddy sequel that is actually quite good. A few good deaths and wise cracks. Although they seemed to finish Freddy off quite quickly that it would seem like they had another sequel planned.
0, sucked!!!: this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that. after 5 I thought it couldn't get worse
1, Freddy's done it again!: This movie was great. Robert Englund was holarious. The graphics and special effects were great. I thought there could been more body count though. It was a great combination of horror and comedy. I think you should see it.
0," 0 STARS: AWFUL!!: ""Freddy's Dead- The Final Nightmare"" is a terrible installment to what was a great horror movie series. This movie is a total joke just like the previous two sequels before it...this garbage"
0, 3-D Sequences barely save this sub-par finish to the series: To fully appreciate this film you have to either seen it in the theater or have a DVD player. The 3D sequence is the film's saving glory. The film seems like it was rushed because the script is bland. I think if the film had brought back Wes Craven then maybe it would've been a superior finish to one of the greatest film series in history.
0, Same ol' song and dance: A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting
0, Pseudo-science: Lomborg's book may appear to consist of logical arguments
0," Soft targets and biased selection: This book pays little attention to the peer reviewed scientific literature on environmental problems. That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems. In addition to picking ""soft targets"" of writings by advocates"
0, Very misleading and shallow: So many people will believe anything they read if it agrees with their beliefs. This book contains errors and distortions. Unfortunately
0, Outdated and Uneducated: An environmental book written by a statistician! 90% of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50% of the time! This author uses this skill liberally.The first chapter makes a very valid point: be aware of what you're reading and be skeptical! The rest of the book is slanted toward his OPINION and he disregards information that doesn't support his viewpoints.Many things may not be as bad as some portray but they aren't as rosy as this author portrays either. READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!

1, Singing voice that mind gets warm: It is a famous piece of music collection which keeps being eternally heard.
0, ULTIMATE RIP-OFF: Do not purchase this download. Track 15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds. It may well be in the master
1, Great!: So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him

0," For Cultural Lemmings Everywhere: Please! Five stars for a collection of the sappiest songs of all time? It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music (""I am music and I write the songs"") yet the abundance of five star reviews here proves that PT Barnium was right...."
1, AWESOME
0, It's a shame cos it's a good movie..: ..between horror and deep emotions with a capital fault:What the hell they think they are in giving us a clear statement against euthanasia??? We are no longer in the middle age I thought.. Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal!
0, Absolutely horrible: Absolutely horrible. 1 star at best. What's there not to like? The acting is absolutely horrible. The special effects
0, Yawn!: I thought the plot really dragged in this sappy
0," Don't even bother - save your money: The DVD is a dissapointment. Over 1/2 of the music footage is missing.It's a ""tribute"" concert"
1, Great Concert: hearing George Michael do SOmebody to Love was a great Moment on this set.ELton John&Axel ROse Dueting was something special as well.it was a great tribute.Seal
1, Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert: An awesome concert of superstars as a tribute to one of the greatest vocalist of all time. I still have the original VHS tape and love it. This DVD (finally) is a must for all the fans of Queen and Rock & Roll music.
0, Smells nice
1, Loves kitty: We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old. He absolutely loved it. Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee. He is now 4 1/2 months old and he still likes it
0, boring...: Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
0, Do yourself a favour
1, great scary movie from wes craven!: I find this movie very well done
1, Iconic slasher flick: This is it. The film that introduced the world to Horror icon Freddy Krueger. Of course Freddy wasn't the ONLY slasher in the '80s (with Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees)
1, One of the best horror movies of all time: Fred Krueger
1, The beginning of your nightmares!: This is the first Nightmare on Elm Street and it rocks! How many people out there have been scared by Freddy? Millions! In the movie Freddy attacks you in your dreams

1, Very Interesting View of The Future: I really liked this book
0, Hmm...: I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time
0, I expected so much more from such a high-rated novel: I was so enthusiastic and worked up to expecting a splendid and original read
0, The ultimate in idiocy: A world where nobody is unhappy... this is supposed to be a bad thing in Huxley's story. What nonsense.I find it strange that Huxley supposedly had any affinity towards buddhism... The ultimate goal in buddhism is the ending of suffering... other things... freedom
0, Doesn't fulfil even the lowest requirements for fiction: I don't understand why Mr. Huxley is so famous. Okay
1, into medialis they do go
1, Great Classic: This book is a great classic of Sci-Fi
0, Not all it's cracked up to be: Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious
1, Pleasently Surprised: I picked this book up at a rummage sale to add to my little library of books. I didn't plan on reading it for quite awhile... until I learned that this book was banned when it was first published in 1932. This is scifi at it's best. There is a lot of scientific information
0, 1984 was much more enjoyable...: A decent book
0, open your eyes
1, Best Negative Utopia I've read (And Yes I read 1984): I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the greatest books I ever read. Everyone already commented on the glimpse of the future...chilling totalitarianism
1, An ominous warning of a possible future. A must read!: Aldous Huxley grips the mind
1, Fantastic light: I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thinks it's the best headlamp he's ever used. He's amazed at the long battery life and the bright lite. We live in the Cascades and he uses it all the time either for work or even to get firewood at night.
1, Great reliable headlight!: I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice. I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use. The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber. I can't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You can't go wrong for the money.
1, good light: Super light
1, Good book for beginners: The book raises a lot of issues that need to be dealt with in designing a web site. This is not a book on how to create a web page. A lot of the material in the book is common sense
0, Slow and obvious: This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life
0, Waste if time; waste of money: I should start by saying I didn't read the whole book. That's because I found it insulting that we were to believe this was a true biography. I resented the author passing off what he thought Gene Kelly must have been thinking during the AFI awards
1," Great country/rock: Excellent product with great vocals. We do a fast line dance to ""Dance"". Great CD with lots to like!"

1, PURE EVIL NEVER REALLY DIES!: Proving there's no rest for the wicked
0, Not easy to dance to: I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all. She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go. When she says dance to the left she is going to the right. They should have done this video in front of a mirror. Big disappointment.
0, garden gnome: A real let down the pictures look so good
0, Only the obvious copied and pasted: This book I found rather disappointing. It is DEFINITELY for the beginner. So much that most information is nearly copied from all the help information provided during the installation process itself.If you are a beginner I would not recommend buying this book. Look for something else!!
0, Penelope lays an egg: Fans of the original Hal Roach series should be outraged at this piece of junk
1, A great movie for kids: The Little Rascals (1994)
1, Best Kids Move Ever: I've never seen any child who didn't want to watch this move at least twice if not three times.
0," disappointed: I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be ""June Cleaver"". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also"
0, Very statistical: I was kind of dissapointed with this material. It only talks about statistics... more like a thesis or something...Was hoping something more conductual-psychological oriented.
0, Be A Doormat For A Man's Ego: The entire book was about stroking a man's ego at the expense of anything the woman may want.You have to submitt yourself towalking on eggs in order to keep his ego full of pride.Isn'tpride a sin? This book is not helpful
1, So interesting!: This has been a very interesting read. I purchased it because I just started dating again after 27 years of marriage and the death of my hubby. I have 3 boys and lots of men in my life and never knew some of the things I learned here! I suggest this for all women.
1, fun: nothing but fun freddys one libners genious his kills bizzre gross and inhuman the actings great aspecialy by alice freddy and her frien yolonda.
0, And they continued the series because why?: Nightmare on Elm Street
0, Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child: The second to worst film in the series. Not that good. Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy. Starring: Robert Englund
0, The new Vhs and Dvd version is terrible: This version of Nightmare on Elm Street is so terrible.Where's the special features at either on this new Vhs or Dvd there's no deleted scenes like the uncut vhs version.Dan's motorcycle scene was more graphic his face was ripped off and a needle stabs his abck
0, A sore dissapointment: Freddy [Robert Englund] returns to haunt alice [Lisa Wilcox] and her friends once more. But this time

1, great: I had been looking for a cake pan with a metal lid for awhile to replace my old one... this is so great I ended up buying 3 and giving them away....you won't go wrong buying this..
1," Exactly that ""An American Coup"": Really gives good insight on what really happened as opposed to what we were told on that fateful day. You may believe all"
0, Add us to the negative list.: When we rented it
0, stupid people who only listen to those that agree: These Idiots wouldn't know a conspiracy if it were to kill them personally. The only thing this movie shows is how easily led some people are. If it were possible to give 0 stars
0, Loose brains: Watch the documentary that was aired on the National Geo or Discovery channel of experts looking into the claims made in this video and they explain it all and conclude that the planes brought it down. But you arm-chair experts know more
1, Better than I thought: I watched this a couple of days ago. It was funny
0, Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie: Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why)
0, An exercise in futility.: This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.
1, Another good Ahern story: I have liked Aherns characters every since his survivor series. The series also has some good characters and action. Kind of a fun read.
1," Freaks: Even people jaded by the extreme ""realism"" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget"

1, The Consummate Traveller: Just when I think I've written a great travel story
1, Must see for fans of traveling shows: Michael Palin provides an offbeat and interesting documentary of his trip from the North Pole to the South Pole. This video makes you wish you could have gone with him!
1, sucked in.: I found this book to be one of the best in the Anita Blake series. For me
1, Circus of the Damned: If you loved Ann Rice you will love laurell Hamilton. Read thenm in order
0, The Decline of Our Gang: Do not confuse the 52 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts with the classic comedies produced by Hal Roach Studios. When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM in 1938
0, Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy: I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from 1938 are OK
1, One hell of a businessman: Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top
0, This is what killed my ear for music.: Not trying to piss anyone off
1, I love this: I love this. My children have all loved it. It's just great
1," Good Book for Experienced Test Takers: Buy this book if you already have substantial experience with NT4 and Windows 2000 and you need help passing the MS tests. I passed the monster 70-240 with this book. The ""On the Exam"" tips were especially helpful. Also"
1, Antidote for a bad mood: Natalie MacMaster's music will lift your spirits any time
0," ""The Reaping"" should have been called ""The Sleeping""...: because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand ""Our Fathers"" or to say the Rosary a hundred times"
0, Of Interest to Preteen Girls: Oh
1, Excellent rendition: Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book
0, What a piece of crap: The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque.
1, The best book I have ever read!: I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week. When i first picked up this book i felt i would not beable to finish it because of my ablity to get bored really quick. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone! I keep on going back in the book to a part i liked best or a place in the story that captivates me. It seems i will never grow tired of this book. I hope all that have read it feel the same!
1, My All-Time Favorite Book: Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures. Mr. Rochester has to be the greatest male figure in literature! Move over Heathcliff! I got goosebumps by the end of the book and wanted to immedietly flip it over and begin again.
1, The best book I'll ever read!: This book is a wonderful story. It is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down. Charlotte Bronte does awesome discriptions. I recomend this book to everyone who likes most classics. I wish people still wrote books this good. I guess you could call this book a trying-to-find-your-place-in-the-world story. Jane is totally amazing! Even if I am only 11
1, You'll either love it or hate it

0, The most BORING book in the world!: I am writing this because I just had to read the book as a requirement for English. It is the worst book in the world
1, Jane Eyre: Enjoyable read! Did not read this while growing up
1, Jane Eyre Still on Top: I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description
1, It made me love to read!: I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise
1, A Bront Sister's Masterpiece: When I was looking through the books at the High School Library

0, Nice try
1, My son loves it: Great toy for my 9 month old. I couldn't even get it wrapped for Christmas! My son chews on it because he is teething
1, Absoutely Wonderful: Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week. Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years. Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points. Not any more. My new best friend the Back Buddy can do all and more that was advertised. Some of the best money I ever spent.
1, Great for spot massage: The Body Back Buddy is great. This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose. This is perfect for use in between massages. It is much better than using the door jamb. I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
1, Awesome deep tissue pressure!: I get so tight in my neck and back
1, Covers it all: Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
1, Body back buddy: This product delivers what it claims. I find it very useful and extremely effective at leveraging hard to reach places on my body and massaging deeply areas regardless of location. I would recommend this product to anyone who has muscle pain/ tightness and can't afford / doesn't want to visit a private masseuse. Considering what you get this is a great value!
1, Helpful product: I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back
1, Small but nice: It's pretty well done
0, not the same in the picture: when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice
0, Too Small!: This product is way to small to hold any mail.... if you are looking for something to hold your mail in do some research first this only holds up to an index card size envelope!
0, NOT RECOMMAND...: TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION
1, Gift for teacher: I gave this to my favorite math teacher and she loves it. The projects make math concepts easier to understand.
1, Highly underrated: Great little movie. I'm surprised it didn't get better reviews. Kids and adults liked it. Check it out
1, Another Bette Davis Classic that does well: This is a pretty good performance by Bette Davis
1, Very Good: I enjoyed this old movie. It is one of Bette in her later years but she still had it.The storyline was a twist too..
1, BRAIN DONORS?! MORE LIKE LAUGH LOANERS!: This movie is just too good for words. It gives you as many laughs as the red green show. The slapstick shenanighans keep comming as the laughs keep rolling. I once laughed so hard i fell asleep and woke up and turned the movie off. One liners
1, An amazing book
0, Horrible Formatting: This book has THE WORST formatting I've ever seen. It looks like it was hastily put together using Microsoft Word. Very amateurish. The cover doesn't even have the title on the spine
1, A REALLY GOOD GAS GUN.: GUN IS VERY GOOD. LOOKS REAL
1, If you love Cajun or if you love rock 'n' roll: you'll love this great CD. The Bluerunners
0, not very useful: It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass. I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing.
0," Marginally Acceptable: I would probably have returned this ""loupe"" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe"
1, Nice loupe
1, Good Clear Quality Loupe for price: Good Clear Quality Loupe for price. Construction could be better
1, Healing from diarrhea and Ulcerative Colitis: I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.
1, Restoring Your Degestive Health: Love this book and Love Dr. Brasco -- just recently acquired him as a physician was so awesome to have a physician PERSONALLY call you when you're having issues instead of office help -- doesn't happen much anymore -- I learned alot from talking to him personally and from this book.
1, A Whimper not a Bang: I give this book 4 stars for taking on the topic but agree with other reviewers who find it disappointing ... perhaps because one gets one's hopes up to read a title like this
1, In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How: Very well written
1, Thorough
1, worth the read: I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story
0, Gets there: It was an interesting read. At first it was tough to follow

0, Good School Bag Not A Great Travel Bag.: I bought this bag for traveling. It is not very comfortable
0, Not worth the time....: I really was excited to start reading this book
0, A bunch of whiny losers: Maybe this show appeals to some people
0, Bad re-imaging: There are several parts of the film when it just goes to a still photo and voice or backround music is heard. If I knew so much of the original film was missing I probably would not have bought it. I was disappointed in my purchase.DPrice
1, Best movie musical ever: An epic musical
0, Wonderful Production but 1937 Version Was BEST: Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor
0, not enough: It looks like a microsfot brochure for the people who have no odea about Axapta. it is giving some basic knowledge for beginniners.
0, I did not understand the codes.: Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me.
0, I just can't get into it: I've had to force myself to read halfway through this book. The pilgrim chapters are the most interesting
0, awful squeaking: yes this is cheap but that's for a reason. the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it. and worst of all
1, just listen it: Scene from the second story: The god machine. All I know about this band
1, Good Ctrl
1, Very confotable and configurable gamepad.: It's confortable
0, these are double dobby stripes: nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
1, Good general source: Although exploring nothing new about the Eastern Front and even making some mistakes in the introduction (for example about the Red Army Purges) this book is a very good source to have for the general account and movement of the German Army throughout 1941 on the Eastern Front as well as the respective response from the Soviet side. Although more sources could and should have been used
1, A source for some information: This work contains some interesting information
0, Don't believe the Hype: I bought this movie after watching the previews on another movie. I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview. This movie is VERY LONG
1, Glimpse into a hidden world: This collection of stories is more than simply a memoir of a childhood lived within a secluded harem. It is also a story of a process of change that took place decades ago as the country of Morocco was becoming an independent nation state.I was fascinated by the stories of the women who spent their lives hidden from the outside world within the family enclaves of the middle class in Morocco. I've purchased it for friends and colleagues who were interested in women's stories
1, Important read: Well written. Insightful. Entertaining. Informative. Important issues for our times. Interesting to compare Mernissi's childhood experiences with all that she has accomplished since.
1, Amazing: The content
0, Keep Looking!: This book was too ambitious. It covered too many topics
1," Safekeeping: I read this because I so enjoyed ""A Three Dog Life"
1, _: This outstanding essay is included in Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins. Great as it is
0, Bridesheads Revisited: Interesting read
0, The SLOWEST read I've had in a long time! Boring!: I usually read a book in one or two nights after dinner. I've been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down. It is just a SLOW read; certainly doesn't have anything in it to hold my interest.I'm a person that refuses to give up (except for a few that I filed in a Mistakes folder) on my kindle. I think I'm up to 62% read now and will probably force myself to finish it but it will definitely get put into the mistakes folder.In other words --- it's just plain BORING!
0," Not JavaScript Objects: Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called ""Ideas for what to do with JavaScript""."
0," Waste of my Money: I have worked with javascript for some time and wanted to learn to create javascript objects and impliment them into my code. I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong. The book could be called ""creating data structures using javascript"" because it jumps right into complex examples of creating data structures with very little explanation of what is happing from a language prospective. I did get far enouph to write some BAD object code and post it out to a news group who got me on the right track. THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. It is now in my trash basket."
0," Faulty Information?: Apparently the author has lived abroad too long. On page one he states: ""A child born in the U.S."
0," my child called this ""the worst game ever"": I will say the 3-d fx do work...for a hand-full of pictures"
0, bearing problems: Both the original and a replacement Keller dovetali bit quickly lost the lower seal on the bearing which will allow sawdust to build up in the bearing and will lead to premature failure.
1, Great and professional product: This is one of the best RC Ni-Starter out there. I did a lot of research before buying this product. It's with no double one of the most durable and professional.

0, Rethink before you buy: It is in no way the bedding that I don't like. I absolutely love the bedding
1, Love the Look and the Quality!: I've purchased or recieved almost all of the pieces to this set for my baby boy's nursery and I absolutely love them. This set has bright colors and a fun feel to it! With a different wall paint color
1, Look on EBAY: I bought the set as well and love it!! I went on ebay and saw a seller that had a lot of the accessories I wanted. I emailed her and asked her if she could get other items I needed. Now I have all pieces to the collection.
1, Very difficult to locate all items: I absolutely LOVE this set; however
1, Perfect for newbies (like me)!: I'm new to c++ and decided to try to learn it through this book.It works magnificent in teaching me how C++ works
1, Suhrhold deck Brush: My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years. It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint. The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor. It is still useable after 25 years.
1, Locke gave a thorough understanding for society.: I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government. It also sets up a State of Nature to justify the State. It tells the role of the individual
1, Optima Deep Cycle Yellow: Great Battery. I use lots of accessories and with a high output ALT this battery does the job. If you run AMPS etc this is the battery for you. Lots of reserve power for the Optima Yellow Category. I recommend it as your next Battery....
1, Detailed and informative
1, funny BUT bad: It is FUNNY... VERY Funny!!!!! its just too bad he has to be so vulgar... beyond the very often F Bombs he drops..... he is a very funny man!
0, Just so you know...: Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me)
0, Hoff doesn't really understand human nature.: I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic
1, The Irregulars: This movie is so pleasant and funny that any audience will love it. The resultant outcome is not conservative at all but does play to most everyone's joy.
0, Inconsistent performance: (+)Great price
0, absolute junk: I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new
1, a very good wireless card: This card has given me the ability to be crazy and sit outside with my laptop and do my work from there. For some reason I feel much more creative when I am outside in the open air rather than inside in the boring stale air.This card was installed in almost no time at all and it felt like it was almost too easy. But after the reboot I was able to find and see that the card was installed correctly and the quick time wasn't a bad thing
1, Fast and stable
1, A real winner: I am glad this was my first choice for a wireless adapter. I was told to go out and buy a wireless adapter and with help from the local store's employee he recommended me this card. He said D-Link was a good reputable company. I believed him and bought this card and brought it home. Besides if he wasn't right I could always return it right back to him. :)Either way I was able to get this working by following the intstructions and was connected to my work's wireless network in minutes. I thank the helpful employee who helped me and I thank D-Link. Thank you both.
1, works really well: I think most of my frustration is due to my ISP
0, Does not install properly on HP notebook running XP: Did not install properly. DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful. Drivers have not passed Microsoft's scrunity. I cannot recommend this at all.
0," Poor quality: Very poor recording. Sounds like it is muffled or filtered. Fortunetly most of these tracks are recorded correctly on the 2 CD set ""The Magic Touch"". Skip this and go to ""The Magic Touch"""
1, Works Great.: I do a little bit of gaming and have compared wireless to running a hard wire and don't find any difference in speed or signal strength. It works well throughout my house (two story 2500 square ft).
0, Piece of Junk: I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review
0, Don't Waste your time or money: This unit is terrible
0, shipping: The router is good- ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the 1st full business day - .. which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise -I will never do business with them again-
0, piece of crap: d-link needs to get its act together. this router of airplus is a laugh. never seen so much problems from one equipment. lost connection
1, 3btech & Amazon: I ordered a DI-624 from Amazon by way of 3BTECH. They sent the wrong Router which was an upgrade a DI-624M. But I used the DI-624 on my system and there is a difference in the speed. 3BTECH told me they where the same but if you read the manual they are not. They would not take it back without me paying a shipping charge and restocking fee. Don't deal with 3BTECH because Amazon will not back them up and you don't get the same service like when you deal with Amazon. Stay away from this 3rd party company. You can only contact them by way of e-mail.
0, dlink sucks: i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful. they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap. i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps.
1, Great workhorse: I've been using this router for years and it has never given me problems. The setup is easy and the maintenance is non-existent. The signal is strong enough to get to my Xbox 360
0, Waste of money - no range: From the word go
0, Connection Problems - cannot use all features: I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection
0, Didn't work for me...: I futzed with this for about a week. Had d-link tech support's number programmed into my phone (power down the router
1, Over my head?: Frustrating at first because it took me a little while to learn how to use the D-Link Router. Once I learned what all of the terms meant
0, Ripoff: I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago; my family got cable and a wired network just wasn't feasible with our layout
0, Buy another router-unstable connections: DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers
1, Caveat usage: Like the previous reviewer
1, Delivers as promised: Not only does this product deliver all that is advertised but the service from D-Link is without a doubt the best in the high tech industry. Every vendor should take notice.
0," can't handle browser idle time (poor support): Installation was easy and everything looked great. Until I tried to access the internet via my browser the next morning (""page cannot be displayed""). All ideas of the helpdesk how to fix it didn't change anything (we exchanged about 20 emails) so that they agreed it was a hardware problem. I returned it and got the next one with the same problem. The answer of the helpdesk this time: don't use ZoneAlarm. And if this is not the problem"
0, Awesomely horrible product: Wow. What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I've ever made. The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard
1, Not as good as season one
0, Not so funny: Just got through watching this. The jokes are cruder
0, Awful!: This is one exploitation that has no story; or the story is so hard to follow that it is incomprehensible. Rita Calderone is gorgeous
0, In a word: Terrible.: How anyone could rate this debacle above one star is beyond me. First of all
1, Recommended: The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy
1, Awesome!: Omg These are so dang cute! I can't wait to try them out! I used the top part as a 'cookie' mold but I'm gonna use the entire thing next time. :)
1, Could be compared with Living Colour: These guys remind me of a softer Living Colour (Vernon Reid
0, terrible
0, Piece of junk - do not bother.: I've been very disappointed with this since we got it. Even with the unit fully charged & operating with the cord plugged in
1, Excellent for the money: I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years
1, If you want to improve your health
1, Great!: I thought this movie was awesome. I've always thought Dana Carvey was a hilarious actor and this movie was just as funny as he. I recommend it!
0, A waste of talent: This movie was probably the biggest bomb of 1994. It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones
1, The beauty is in the truth: People
1, My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them: My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far
1, A realistic view of what it is like to have dementia: This was a book that was kind of hard to read at times because it was written by an individual who actually had Alzheimer's. However if you really want to see how the individual themselves are affected by the disease this is a good book to try to read.
0, Only for those in absolute need of resolution: I never thought I would say this about a book in this series
0, Should never have been written: I highly recommend NOT reading this book
0, Weak ending to a great series: I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed
0, A poor ending to a great story: I can't tell you how dissapointed I was in this book. It was not what I have come to expect from Orson Scott Card. Many authors take a concept to the point where they just fill pages with words (i.e. Piers Anthony & his Xanth tales)
0, How could this happen?: I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason
0, Card should have quit while he was ahead !: He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of ..
1," GREAT ENDING TO THE BEST SCI-FI SAGA EVER WRITTEN: ""Jane closed her eyes"
1, A new triumph of a great mind: This book
0, Too many miracles....: Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated
0, Things kind of got crazy...: ...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
1, Very scary and very good!: Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! The only thing I didn't understand was the ending. Otherwise this was a great book!
0," I didn't get ""it"": I like Adam Sandler"
0, Move on: I saw this movie when it was originally released and have to say that may thoughts of it have not gotten any better in that time. I had high hopes for it going in and kept waiting for that moment when I would feel that my money had not been wasted. The moment never came. This was an awful movie. Boring dialog
0, Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: I've seens some bad movies in my day
0," Don't Bother: How anyone could think this movie was anything but complete garbage was beyond me.I guess a lot of these reviewers are extremely ""deep."""
0, Not Worth Watching -spoilers-: This movie is a bore! And kind of annoying!It's not a romance/comedy! Drama...er...a little? Not a lot.Alright
0, Save your time and your money...: I saw this movie after seeing trailers for it on a couple of occasions. I thought it looked like a light comedy/romance. What a waste of my time and money! The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the hope that it HAD to get better eventually. Wrong. I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan
0, Sad
0, punch drunk love: This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Adam sandler is the ony reason i kept watching. No plot
1, The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time: A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work
1, ANOTHER GREAT NOVELLA BY THE AWESOME DIVAS: I truly enjoyed this work of fiction by my favorite authors. I hate to tell what is in a book
0, Flexrake 100A: I have had a hula hoe for year. It has worked will and the handle is worn out. After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks. It is because of the way the aluminum handle is inserted into the hoe head. They make cuts along the end of the handle and insert it into the taped end of the head. This makes it very weak. I bent after a little use. I contacted Hula Hoe and they are sending me a new handle. However
1, Four Stars - For this price you know what to expect!: I'm not going to get into many technical details. Not because I can't but because at this price range you KNOW what you are getting. With that said this unit has performed very well. Most of us will never run this at the high end of the volume spectrum
0, My third POS Sony...: The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers. Complicated setup
0, Worst receiver I have ever bought: Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working. Up until now
1, This book is well written: This book is well written. I love the details of the history of Seven Oaks. It does include some pictures which help to illustrate of a time and place long lost.
0, BEWARE! Pan and scan DVD: These two movies are not Conway's best
1, Great Movie: In received my video very fast. I love doing business with Amazon. I never had any problems with them. The movie is great if you like Tim Conway. I love the old movies. They are classic to me. So you should enjoy the movie if you enjoy him.
1, Farm Aid at its best: You gotta see it to believe it. Call your friends
0, Not so good: Bad
0," ""But what are her chances?!"": This movie is great to watch if you're having a bad movie night with snarky friends. As a serious movie"
1, Another Supreme Vampire title!: this one is good very good in fact! imagine vampires came forward and revealed themselves to the world (only about 4500 world wide) sun does not harm them they are allergic to silver (umm werewolves eh sheesh) and beheading is fatal its a modern future that looks decayed such as ww3 took place (in london no less lol) but the explanation of vampires as an evolutionary step rather then supernatural was refreshing for a change yes they can climb walls yes they drink blood and yes they are super strong ( as demonstrated in the video of vampires showing themselves lifting something not so light hehe)4 of 5 stars only one star loss for being a little talkie but theres enough action and vampire action to make this film a must own to any true vampire fan!
0, a million thumbs down: I only gave this movie one star because there wasn't an option for NEGATIVE 5 stars
0, When the movie ended the fun began: Seriously
0, Awful: Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie
0, where are the rules?: Simplicity of it... the first of 45 minutes of it was intriguing
1, Quite Possibly ...: This has to be the best
1, Excellent book: The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although
0, Really Sad!: I remember the first time I heard Nelly
0, GWEN'S LEFT OVERS: I bought this album cuz it was on sale for $7 bucks. It ONLY has 3 good tracks: Maneater
0, a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani: sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves
0, A little catchy
0, What a sell out!: I loved Nelly Furtado's cd Folklore. But what I used to love about Nelly Furtado was that she prided herself in her music... not bumping and grinding with Justin Timberlake. Why does nearly every single famous female feel the need to suddenly become a sex image? She's a gorgeous girl and she doesn't need to sport a baby tee to prove it. For that reason alone
1, whatchutalkinbout?: people are saying nelly sold out and changed but why? She was always a little bit of r&b and hip hop anyways beneath all those folk tunes. She was in a hip hop group before her first album
1, Plain and simple: YOU NEED THIS CD!!I have been waiting a long long time for another N. Furtado album and it was honestly worth the wait. Granted it's completely different from her previous work (which are also great) but its ok for artist to change
1, Cold War Fun: I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun.
1, movie: I wanted a copy of this movie because my husband is in it.I haven't watched it to the end yet
1," Classic movie!: Been looking for this movie on DVD for years. One of the all time classic comedies. Comedic timing perfect! Not your ""action packed"" comedy"
1, The Russians Are Coming
0, the movie is great
0, Mail Order Ties...: I can't recommend ordering ties on line--or at least
0," Mixed feelings: So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori ""schooling"""
1, Excellent addition to your collection: I collect action figures and when I saw these I immediately thought they were the most original action figure I've seen in a long time. They are fun to assemble they have a good number of variants coming out and they are completely interchangeable. In fact the website even encourages you to make your own parts and to paint them. They are capable of providing hours of fun for anyone from 8 to 60+.
0, disapointed 8 year old: My son bought the green and tan stikfas. First he was disapointed that there was only one figure. He'd imagined a number to set up a battle. At this price that is unlikely. (Maybe this is a creative toy for grown ups in there early 20's with lots of money.) He built it
0, Very Disappointed!: I was looking forward to getting this book. Well
0, Buy the green stuff instead -_-: It doesn't seem to matter how much I press the edge in to the surface
0," Doesn't work as well as original: I recently put in bamboo flooring on my stairs and needed to paint the sides of the stairs where they were scuffed during installation. I used this ""Delicate tape"""
1, Running Blind ( Jack Reachger no 4): I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman.
1, uncanny: like the way he fiqures out the truth
1, Gripping: I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action
1, Good book: It was a very good book! I cant wait for the next book in the series. Reacher at his best.
0, Not the best Reacher: An interesting idea for a crime spree
0, Horrible: I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago
0, This IS 'Running Blind': This is the same book as 'Running Blind'. If you own that title
1," Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4): I thought the ending was a bit ""flat"" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books. Also"
1," Good who and ""how"" dunnit. Keeps you guessing.: Great dialogue and keeps you guessing until the end. Although it is an earlier Jack Reacher novel"
1, good read: Just past the middle of it. Not as much violence as the other books but it has more curves in the plot than JLO... If you dislike the FBI
0, dvd does not play: I was very excited to get this movie on dvd which did arrive very promptly. Unfortunately
0, 3 Defective Phones from ATT and Counting: I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were
0, How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??: The phone itself is pretty good
1," Functional and Fairly Durable: I received this hamper as a baby shower gift and then turned around and purchased one to give to a friend for her baby shower. It's quite attractive and available in several nice colors. Since it doesn't scream ""baby"
1, Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ - above average: My knowledge of Oracle and Java is beginner/intermediate level and I like this book a lot.The book explains how SQLJ relates to SQL
0, Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE!: The music is not by the original artist. Like buying bad Karioke. Very misleading.
1, A history of a major Wall Street bank and more.: When in 1976 Jerome Kohlberg
0," Does not fit!: Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette. The description ""For GM 87-05"" is too vague."
0, Wouldn't Recomend to Anyone: Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. Hooked all the necessary wires up
1, I never ordered this but get to review it anyway!: Gotta love the internet
1, Metra Harness: I LOVE Metra products!!!!!!!!!!!!They make installing a stereo SUPER easy
0, Well....not quite what I anticipated: This bag was going to be for me to use at college
0, why do people like this so much?: It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it. I think it is not good for a child. Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke!!!
1, Simple
0, This looks nothing like it does in the picture . Very misleading: I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
1, hannah montana clock: my daughter loves this clock. She's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself. It works!
1, jansport backpack: It's a great book bag. Very roomy
1, JanSport backpack a hit: Great backpack! My son goes through them like you would not believe. This time
1, Perfect!: I've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great. I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid. Even though it wasn't the same as shown (not really a good thing) I ended up liking it better than the sample picture.
1, High School Backpack: I especially love the color of this backpack
1, receive faster than i expected: The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected. Very nice purchase experience!
0, Bag is here as it is but the fabric is cut from the top.: I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it. Problem is it's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag. This is not what i really imagined to get.
1, It's fresh!: My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic
0, light duty backpack: Purchased it for junier high school student. it's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be. Overall
1, Great Backpack!: Great Backpack! Love the color! The only thing
1," ""Kim...hits the spot"": I remember years ago"
0, Not up to the standards of the first two LPs!: Freak City Soundtrack finds our Chicago lads getting a little too close to their Marshall stacks - The Jesus & Mary Chain would be jealous of the feedback that permeates this record.For those who thought International Pop Overthrow was a little too candy-coated
0, Static in My Ears is more like it: I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is
0, Stuck in old Testament: I always liked Davids first books and was looking forward to reading the 2 end times books he wrote but his proof text is all old Testament and has NOTHING to do with America in fact the verses he used was spoken by the prophets for Israel only and not the Church. It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.
0, Sad
1, LOVE IT!!: Am very limited in what I can eat
0, In a nutshell: This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design
1, Plugged it in ... Next thing I know I am Connected.: Install the drivers
0, Careful: Will Freeze Up Your Machine: My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally
0, One of the worst films I&#65533;ve ever seen: When Snipes is playing in a film
0, Snipes can do better!: This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy
0, Absolutely Terrible: I love Wesley Snipes
0, WTF: I am very
0, Where to start?: This movie was so slow and long. Once you finally reach the last 45 minutes
0, More Hollywood Schlock: Yet another braindead
0, Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I have attempted to watch this movie twice. After getting part way through it both times
0, Might be the only one but I hated it.: From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone else loved this film more than I did. I wanted to leave the cinema (two of my friends did) when I went to see it. I found the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper well acted and touching but I was irritated by the parts of the film that featured Nicolas Cage's character
0, Over-rated
0, don't be fooled
0, Worst Movie Ever: This movie was BY FAR the worst movie I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
0, watch something else: Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his interpretation(s) but I can't understand how this movie can get 5 stars... it is boring boring boring and quite ridiculous in some scenes.
0, This is horrible: I'm sorry
1, Fast Music From Slow Kids: The next time Bono or Scott Weiland whine about how being a rock star is some sort of elitist job
0, What a Joke: I have to say that I don't feel I need to say this music is good because these kids are retarded. I laugh every time i listen to this. I feel bad for the people with normal mentality who produce it and play the instruments for these kids. HILARIOUS. All the people who say its good are probably just a bunch of single white females with no lives who complain about everything and blame violence on t.v and video games.This CD sucks. But it gets me laughing
0, THE MUSIC KINDA BLOWZ: It just wasn't good i do better sometimes it was funny though so maybe it's worth buyin you know!
1, Peony: Bought this book to read for book club. It is very interesting and believable. The club enjoyed it as well.
1, Awesome Access Point with 802.11g speeds: This AP has some good quality features. Filtering
1, Fantastic!: Beautiful Music! Its like a magical evening with pitch perfect angels singing to you! I highly endorse this! 2 thumbs up!
0, DONT READ!!!!: This book is the downer of the century. Just when you think something is going to happen BAM!!!! the book is over. I accidently finished the book. Thats pathetic! Most fiction has a rising action that is not present in this book. Its a great book about nothing.
0, If I believed in burning books
0, Awful Literature: I'd give this book 0 stars if possible
0, Not Suggested for the Clinically Depressed: And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed
0, Wharton gets her point across: If I were to use four words to review this book
0, Ethan Frome: It's classics like this one that discourage me from reading classics! and if I have to come up with additional words: here they are!
0, AWFUL
0, The WORST book in the history of ink!!!: ... Ethan Frome is a worm with no backbone who was afraid to stand up to his overbearing wife. Period!! The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. ... This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading. After reading this piece of garbage you'll wish you were illiterate!!.
0," Times have changed: When Edith Wharton wrote ""Ethan Frome"
0, How BORING!: This book was so detailed - i don't know how someone could drag out a 48 hour period of time into 9 chapters. Very detailed and drawn out. If you dont have to read it don't.
1, Wonderful reference!: It is really a shame this book is out of print! I have had my students read it for in-depth
0, I tried hard but I failed: It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it
1, Sweet and depraverd: Saint Reverend Jen
1," Should be a good read: Hi! I'm a teenager that was in a small group (called a ""D""-group) in which Wendy was my leader. She's a very gifted writer and a strong Christian"
1, They don't make great classic movies like this any more !!!: Trail Of Robin Hood is a great movie with Roy Rogers and my favorite actresses is Penny Edwards. I feel all these movies need to come out into theatres again so people can take a step back in time to remember and see the greatest actors & actresses in the world.
1, Groovy
1, Nice Booster!: This is a wonderful backless booster seat. Much more plush than most you find for sale. Light weight
0, $3 Bucks Down the Drain - Just Awful: I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!! TOTALLY TRASH
0, Volleygal: If I could leave zero stars
0, TERRIBLE
0, Everybody Dies: John Cusack and Ray Liotta
0, Ghostly Court: In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic
1, wow - a film that's scary and smart at the same time: I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie more than once...unless you're looking for clues that give away the ending. However
0, Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe: Even John Cusack can't save this. I expected to see something different. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This has been done before though some people believe it hasn't. This was a rip off of many Hitchcock stories as well as some horror films.PEOPLE GETTING BUMPED OFF AT RANDOM: Original...not!KILLER WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES: Been there
1, PSA: Skip other guy's review below-it gives away the ending!: Public service announcement: If you haven't seen this movie yet
0, Identity crisis: John Cusack is always great
0, UMM.... WHAT CAN I SAY?: First off
1, Buzz words and phrases: Back in the 70s this group became legend among musicians of every genre at the time. We found hundreds of ways to filter lines from these recordings into every day situations and never got tired of listening to this hilarious spoof that took every one of us back to the days of southern local radio shows that our parents listened to religiously in the 50s. Like all satire
1," Good ole' boys playin' for 'em good ole' boys: In the words of ole' Roadhog himself this record is ""mighty fine"". I heard these guys live when they opened for the Stafford Brothers and Mother Mayball Carter last Winter down to the Johnny Mack Brown Highschool gym and was imeadiately impressed. All I can say is buy as many copies of this country classic as you can get yer hands on before it goes out of print.Five stars jist aint enough"
1," British Science Fiction At Its Best!: Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book ""The Midwich Cuckoos."""
1," I FEEL HER PAIN!: When I first heard this song I was startled! This song sounds like it really came from deep inside her heart. We've all been hurt my men in ourlives..and yes we all feel like SCREAMING ""I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ..I SYMPATHIZE. Every time I hear her song I BLAST IT!..So I can hear her scream to her full extent. She is awsome! I recommend this to all women who have been deceived and lied to by men. Womens National Anthem!"
0, Let's Tear Down This Wahl: HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews
1," Great Selection: I have to say that I like Rhino and Varese Sarabande's CDs so much more that the slapped-together compilations that I find in the ""cheap racks"" at Tower (and other stores). This CD has a ton of great '80s hits on it...and the liner notes are really fact-filled"
1, We love it: I use it to decorate my sons's bedroom. There's not much dr Seus decorations stuffs on the market. But I did it with this and other stuffs and looks awesome. Ans my son loves his room.

0, Can only be used with full zoom: The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed
1, Pretty good: I liked this book. Precise
1, The Machanic: An excellant film shows Charles Bronson at his best the steely eyed hero out as usual to wow the watching public and as usual chooses a script to suit I think his rugged personality.Truly an actor pulling you through every twist and turn. I can thoroughly recommend this DVD as it is exciting all the way and you never know what the character is thinking before the next something else happens. A film though to watch I think on one of those rainy days with your popcorn
0, Big Disappointment: Nice gimmick
1, you people...hahahahahaha: you know
0, Overhyped & Overrated: I seem to be one of few in my opinion of this movie which is that it's not a good movie. I felt the movie was boring and lacking of a good plot. I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie. This movie in my opinion is very overrated.
0," Clean Slate II: Remember the Dana Carvey comedy ""Clean Slate""? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud. The plot is fine"
0," A Wildly Overrated Film!!: I cannot believe how many people loved this film. It is grossly overrated. Discussions around this film center on its ""groundbreaking"" backwards structure. Well"
1, nuF eivom: I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing
1, Engrossing and Thought Provoking To Say The Least: Wow
0, Thanks robe4
1, wow: what a movie if u dont loke this great movie theres somthing wrong with u its just pure genius loved this movie its on my top three next to the lord od the rings trilogy
1, A great movie.: This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime
1, Unforgettable.: Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character
1, You'll watch it over and over: Heck
1, SMART MOVIE!!!: Brilliantly made movie. Guy Pearce is outstanding. I've never seen a movie made the way this one was. It was a little hard to follow. You have to pay attention through the whole movie. If you miss one part
0, Navigational Nightmare Extremely Frustrating: The film is great
1, One of the most original and satisfying movies ever made: Just effing brilliant. The type of movie you can watch over and over again
0, The hours....: What an awful
0, Nicole Kidman? Who?: Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were equally as good if not better than Nicole Kidman in this movie. I really have to wonder why the academy gave the oscar only to Kidman.And... as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses
0," The Hours: I do not have much to say about movie ""The Hours"". All I will say is that I wasted an hour of my life on watching it in theaters. This movie is short"
0, serious technical flaws: audio and visual faults made this otherwise interesting story impossible to enjoy. I have had the same problems with other videos and don't know if the problem lies with my computer or
0, pretentious drivel
0, Only because there is no 0-star ranking: This movie is absolutely dreadful. I am sure that there are a lot of people out there who love this movie (I know some of them)
0, High expectations unmatched by reality: After all of Meryl Streep's successes we had just about concluded that If Meryl Streep was in the movie
1, Streep Deserved the Oscar: While it took me more than one viewing of this film to understand its focus
1, A JOURNEY THROUGH PARIS: Polemic Polanski made a decent kind of thriller
0, Good movie
0, Could be better: Should have been written as acceptable or even worse. Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed.
1, Timeless book: A light but inspiring read. Insightful and encouraging. This is 'hope' in a book for women with a style crisis.
0, Very poor piece of work: I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms. You can hardly hear the rain and thunderstorms for the much louder and very poor overlay of very poor music.
0," I only give it 1 star because that's the lowest you can go!: This is NOT what I expected at all. I simply wanted a cd with the sounds of a rain storm...that's it. I didn't expect to get some cheesy music played very poorly. You can barely hear the rain over the music. The CD states that it's ""Rain Storms: Sounds of Nature."" Any person should be able to safely assume this does not include music. I guess I assumed wrong. Don't buy this."
1, A Good Soundtrack For a Movie I've Never Seen!: There's an interesting story behind my decision to get this soundtrack. A few years back
1, All time favorite: I bought this soundtrack 8 years ago and is still one of favorite ever. I have always been a big U2 and Bono fan
1, The Rainbow and the Rose; Revisited: I read The Rainbow and The Rose 
1, Great for my 3 year old: Great movie- my 3 year old loves this series and it was in good rewind condition. Good price & delivery time = thanks !!!
1, Good And Very Entertaining: My 5 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this whole series. She wants to watch them over and over. They all seem to have great lessons and messages for kids to learn. This one was good and very entertaining.
0, The Time of Great Confusion: I couldn't understand if they were speaking language or else not. Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if this is how those graceful creatures spoke to each other. Although this movie was a bit too artsy for me
0, Grandmother: Not a good movie for young children
1, Typical Christie....Awesome...: Ok
1, A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska: I was fortunate enough to meet Larry at a book signing recently. He gave a slide presentation which included many photos of his hunting experiences. The photos and advice shared that evening were enough to motivate me to buy and read his book. Once complete
1, The dogs love them... yes they smell but so do dogs...: My dogs love these things... have ordered several times... people say they stink... of coure they do... who cares... I Just ordered more...
1, Good Start - Predictable Finish: This film had some very intriquing elements to it. Kate Winslet was solid and Kevin Spacey was excellent. The direction by Alan Parker gave it the eerie elements that keep you uneasy throughout. However
1," Political: Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet star in ""The Life of David Gale"" as a death row inmate and a news reporter. They carry their emotions gracefully giving this movie the emotion it needs. The writers found a unique style to darken death row more than the average movie. The debates about politics are eye opening to many. The editors add handwritten words and images to desplict the intensity of the next scene. The many surprises will keep the audience watching every scene closely wondering what will happen next. Those who look away for a second will not understand the rest of the movie unless they rewind it. The end has the biggest surprise(shhhhh). Afterward"
1, Excellent
1, good movie: I Think this was a very good movie. I only give it 4 stars because of some of the scenes..they were meant for teenagers..sex scense and a naked chick i know it was suppose to look like a rape but they could have made the movie with her clothes on ew! But there was good acting..good plot..and a very suprising ending! GOOD JOB
1, encouraging poster for REAL women: this poster with marilyn monroe on a bench press is quite sweet
0, Nothing more than I know before: Absolutely basic information about boat interior.Good for beginers.Information about table chart and equipments are very old. We have XXI st century
1, Great shovel for the trunk of your car...: If you park in the street or want to have all the winter gear in your trunk
0, Bizarro Humming/Singing Ruined It For Me: I like a lot of Keith Jarrett's music and the music on this CD is great -- UNTIL you hear Mr. Jarrett start bleating out off-key humming/singing
1, Deleted Scenes make it worth it: This movie has been one of my favorites for several years. Being able to view the deleted scenes was a great way to see more of what Rob Reiner was trying to create with this picture.The 'making of' special that is also included on the DVD was excellent as well. Provided plenty of comments from Rob and Nora giving an excellent view into the creative minds behind this wonderful picture. I already own this on VHS but had to add the DVD to my collection. I am glad I did.
1," Not just another ""chick flick"": This is the standard to which all modern ""romantic-comedies"" should be held. This is a truly funny and romantic movie"
0, Yawwwwwn: I am probably not the person to review this movie. I think Billy Crystal has about as much acting talent as a ball of lint. No human male actually acts like that
0, a contrived cliche: yuck. i really hate this film. first of all
0, You'll need a shower after this one...: If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere
0," Hard Read: This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading"
1, Very Stylish Sneakers: I gave my 3.5 year old daughter
1, good movie: Bought this as a gift
1, satisfying and fun: great movie with Depp as Sam who falls for Joon played by Masterson who is mentally ill and who has an older brother played by Aidan Quinn. wonderfully acted with Depp doing great bits. for his loving women fans. a not to be missed Depp film I might add.
1, An odd wonderful dramatic romantic comedy.: An Normal but Mentally Ill Artist named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) falls in love with a Odd Quirky Outsider named Sam (Johnny Deep)
1, Benny and Joon DVD: This is a wonderful movie. It arrived within a few days in perfect condition and was packaged with care to the contents. We are very pleased and would recommend this seller.
1, Benny and Joon: I'd forgotten what a great movie this is! Johnny Depp
1, I love this movie: Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie. It always makes me laugh and cry no matter how many times i have seen it. The sister ya she is a lil off but Sam fell for her and her brother Benny is skeptical and overly protective of his sister. Its a great story and makes a great addition to any house hold collection.
1, Great CD!!!: I bought this CD the day I went to go see the movie. The whole CD is wonderful
0, hans falls short on this one!!: after last year's majestic score for gladiator

0, Defective oxy acetylene torch: This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.
1, Fantastic: This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature) 120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday
1, Great Foot Bath: I purchased it as a gift
0, comfortable but with problems!: I feel comfort to try this machine.But three problems.first
1, Brookstore foot spa: Received the foot spa and we were able to immediately start using it. The remote control is great so you can keep relaxing and not bend over to change things. The jets are nice and strong. The best part is the heated water temp. It never cools off
1, Excellent Choice: Very good product
1, Good But With A Caution: Although this one is fairly better than part 6
0, What Were They Thinking?: When I was younger
1, far fetched but a good scare: Just one more jason movie. Part 9 is a good one but also quite different. Now
0, garbagex9: This movie was boring and whack again like all the friday the 13th movies were
0," jason went to hell with this trash: acting like none of the other movies happened jason goes to hell takes the series in a new and horrorible new turn. steeling from ""the thing"" jason is not unstopable he just takes over new bobies when he needs them?? huh where did that come from???? not worth the 2 for 11 dollars bin at wal-mart"
1, I liked it...: I thought this movie was pretty good! It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected
1, Spirit Filled Experience: This DVD is powerful and filled with the anointing. With Michael W. Smith as the vehicle of praise
0, A waste of time: Have you ever rented a movie
0, Sandra and Hugh Just Were Not On Target: TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality
1, Hugh Grant looks good again and it is soooo funny!: I think this film was hillarious. I liked it when Sandra got stuck on Hugh's belt
0, Great movie - badly produced DVD disk: Love the movie
0, Bullock boring. Even Hugh Grant can't save this movie.: Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it
1, What the critics find lacking I find fun escapism: Okay
1, A must see: This is such a good movie I can't believe it is not for sale! I have to agree with the other viewers that it took me back a few years but boy did it make me feel good. They should definetly release this again! My husband got tired of paying for rentals for this movie so he found it for me on an Internet auction site. Everytime I say that I want to watch it he says oh that again but I think he secretly likes it just as much as I do. After seeing this movie it is no wonder why Julia is such a big star.
0, BORING: This film was just stupid. Several friends work in a pizza parlor together
0, No Freddie
1, Excellent product for thirsty pets: I have used this product for several months without any major issues. I would recommend this waterer to any potential buyers. It is sturdy and easy to clean. There is a gurgling noise when the water needs to replenish in the bowl. At first
0, Poor quality bottle: Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year. Oh
0, Depicted wrong: Not what I expected. Has the big hole instead of the small hole for the water to come out. With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug.
0," FILLING/PLACMENT DIFFICULTIES....: These pet ""silos"" are a wonderful invention to keep the ""Baby's"" bowlsfilled and to keep the owner from bending over sooo frequently!!!HOWEVER-the Petmate Le Bristo"
0, No lid like in the photo!: The photo is deceiving. This arrived without a lid
0, Never Again!: If I could rate this lower than one star
1, keeps fresh water for all 3of my dogs: I have 2 of these and love them .. except when the puppy plays in the bowl! .
1, works great but: the tank works great and stays cleaner than others I have had in the past but someone should have engineered some kind of handle into it. I have spilled a lot of water on the floor getting the tank back on top. Still I would recommend this dog water dish
0, No home should be without a Regis Philbin.: This album was originally released in 1968
1, Hot Stuff

0, Meh: Based on the other reviews
1, Kingdoms Review -eels-: A man called e and Abroken toyshop are profoundly astonishing and origanal albums. Following are three more adversly fantastic epics - Beautiful Freak
1, Cute and Quirky But No Turkey: Jad who? I hear you ask. Well
1, Switching Stories: This movie was good because it had a lot of nudity and the best parts were when they switched stories from one to another. There was one story where the director was shooting a vampire movie. The other was in his head - he had something else going on involving a murder.
0, They've got their own way.....: Of ripping fans off. And this is yet another example. (Oh and Duranies
0, Weak DVD: I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous
1, a must for any fan: This is a great collection of the best videos-- a must-have for any Duran Duran fan. If only they had a DVD version!
1," Truly the Greatest: While many people criticize this DVD for its ""difficult"" menu options and for its many Easter Eggs"
1, I found the 17 mins version of New Moon on Monday!!!: Bought my copy yesterday at a bargin price about $12.99. I tried to find the hidden alternate versions and then finally found a way. The 17 minutes version of New Moon on Monday is just worth every penny spent. If you can't find them
1, greatest close but not quite: I really enjoyed getting to see all the old classics from the band. But it seems Capitol forgot some of their other greatest. What about Perfect Day or Lonely in Your Nightmare? Although it was a nice treat to see New Moon on Monday.
1, Science and style: Why do geese don't get obese? Easy. What's sauce to the goose
1, Sliding Doors: Sliding Doors [Region 2]I really enjoyed watching this movie. I bought it after borrowing it from the library. Talk about love!! Yes

1, If I could give 10 stars
1, Gwyneth Paltrow yet again does another excellent job.: This is a touching drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow as yet another Helen
1, A very well made movie
0, Mediocre: An original story idea that was watered down by a lackluster script
0, Battle of the Scrawny Suitors.: A look at two scenarios for Helen's (Gwyneth Paltrow) life: what would have happened had she made the train
1, A real feel good film: Fantastically clever storyline and wonderful characters. Funny and sad
0, free list should be free: I don't really like it when they put ebooks that cost money on the list that states free! I don't care how good the book is or isn't
1, Good performer: This item worked well for the first run. It is reconditioned item but it is well worth a try. The carpet dried quicker than I thought. The water took buckets of dirty particles out of my carpet and now it is very nice. Simply
0, A questionable cast spoiling a not-quite-there-yet score.: I very much enjoyed the American version of Sunset Blvd.
0, Weird Movie: This movie certainly has great actors in it
0, Not Vintage MacLean: This is the weakest book of his I have read
0," Disappointing: I read ""On Beauty"" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for ""White Teeth."" However"
0, No more books about writers.: I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy
0, Disappointed: After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre
0, Pointless and disappointing: Considering the awards it won
1, Wow: Once I started this book I could not put it down. There was no mercy on this family. What a page turner!
1, Strong Characters in On Beauty: Like many other posters
0, Huge disappointment: Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me
0, Disapointing read: I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback
0, Disappointing: I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum
0, not even snoop could save this one: bad movie terrible visual effects low budget filming just horrible i hate i even purchased it
0, The movie is not as good as it should have been: The movie sucked. Snoop
0, Made Because of Snoop Dog's Indiscretion with an Aardvark: One insightful reviewer wrote Snoop Dogg was forced into being in this travesty because someone had a picture of him and an aardvark doing what only should be done with one's spouse. That reviewer may well be on point. Either that or Snoop Dogg was seduced with that funny plant sometimes called Mary Jane. Also
0, Don't bother!: This must be the most god awful movie on the PLANET! If I was alowed to give this film ZERO stars I would
0, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!: Albert Pyun
0, A Disappointment: I have read almost all of Mitchner's books and I have enjoyed all of them until this one. It is bland
1, Grocery bag size: This basket is big enough to fit one grocery bag or one Westie dog when her short legs get too tired. This basket makes my bike more functional. I'd recommend it to anyone.
1, sturdy basket: I wanted a sturdy basket that I could hold my bag and other items. This works perfectly. It was easier to put on then the directions made it seem. The directions where more complicated then needed.
1, Good: A hard to find item but worked well on my 18 speed womens bike. Good for the price. Installed easily
0, Problem with charging - SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW: Bought this otherwise fantastic product. Could not charge it ater a few weeks of use. Then got another one and could not charge it after a few weeks of use. Then they sent another one 3 days ago and it has just stopped charging.And when I call the customer service they told me that it was the FIRST time they heard someone having a charging problem with Plantronics 590a. Somehow I am having a hard time believing them. I feel they are getting dozens of calls each day.Any other readers - if you are having a similar experience - pl post your charging woes.Sad that this is an otherwise good product. But unusuable due to this problem. I recommend prospective buyers to hold off until these design flaws or fixed. Or a competitor beats them to it.

1," great show....filmed well and lindsey is a true artist!: Even though he was once one of the great ""pop stars"" in the world...Lindsey Buckingham is an artist. He creates songs from his heart...he plays guitar in a unique and beautiful way and really truly is like no other. Spending an hour and a half with him in concert is inspiring and fun...and speaking of fun"

0, MOTOROLA Bluetooth Headset H500: I purchased this headset Friday 12/2/2005 from the Alltell office. I used it for the first time on Monday 12/12/2005.Pros: Excellent headset speaker. Best I've ever heard.All features work great!!Cons: Extream back ground noise. Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end. If you drive a Tractor-Trailer truck as I do
1, Good but Not Really Funny: With everyone else raving about how funny this book was I bought it. I was not disappointed with the story
1, More fun than a roller coaster!: [...] I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's brand of humor. Like all of his books
1, A poke in the eye: I always enjoy Hiaasen. His use of irony and knife edged dialogue are a poke in the eye of those abusing our environment.
1," A great romp: A breezy read. Similar in tone to Elmore Leonard (one of my favorite ""beach read"" authors). Trippy"

1, THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM: Let It Be has gotten so much stick over the last 30 years and why? Because it's not as good as Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road? Well not much is but this gives them a run for their money. McCartney is at his peak on this album with three of his best songs
0," THE SAD :( ""LET IT BE"": What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis"

0," Absurd movie -- must have been ""rent-due"" day in L.A.: Disgusting scenes of excess violence toward women and fake orgasms all around make this ridiculous farce seem like a soft-core version of every Porn King's first feature film. As a further insult"
1, Really loved it
1, This Books Haunts Me: I was 12 years old when I read this book (I'm now 46). My understanding and impressions of the fall of Troy and all the rich cannon of literature that surround it will be forever seen through the eyes of Helios and the other living characters in this story. No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development
1, greatest: this cd was sent promptly and it is a great cd
1, Top line: As a custom woodworker I have a love for tools that do the job I need done. The is the greatest little saw on the market. The only draw back is trying to find someone that sells it without going on line.
0, Slippery handle
1, It did the job.: I had a drawer that fell everytime you pulled it out - very irritating. I purchased a drawer rail at home depot
1, Great Western: Cast is great - good to see an early Heston in a Western role. A little long
0," My favorite scene: When the ""Major"" wants to rescue Jean Simmons and make war on the Hennesy's. ""Leech"" (Heston) says I can't back you on this Major and all the hands agree. When the Major starts to ride in alone"

1, Excellent Treat!: I got these as a treat for my beagle
0, AAHHH!!! (as in suprise and/or alarm): me and my fellow cohorts thought we'd find a new way to torture ourselves via the medium of motion picture
0," More of a car accident than a movie: Both can result in Post Tramadic Stress Syndrom and both make you not want to repeat the experience. The actors are bad(and trust me I have seen many ""bad movies)the plot is invisable(there isn't one) and my time was wasted. I realize that this is a kid's movie for a specific audience but happened to making a movie enjoyable for adults? Or kids over 5 for that matterOverall-I know you are not thinking about wasting your time with this movie but just in case you've blown a circut and feel compleaded to rent do not bother."
0, I must protest with all that I have......: Either Johnny8Ball is at the height of his sarcastic powers or he has contributed the single worst review ever to appear on Amazon.com. Not only is the movie he selected one of the most incompetent and offensive ever made
1, Excellent
0, Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels: My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. At the time she was 15 months old. She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat. She quickly learned to climb on and off and go forwards and backwards and loved her bike. The steering was a little stiff and took a while for her to get the hang of it.As spring came we moved outdoors and she got better at steering. She grew so I moved the seat to the second setting. Now
0, Defective master?: I was thrilled to see this classic released on DVD
0, Cheasy
0, GREAT MOVIE!...but...: I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy
0, Does quality matter???: I bought this movie yesterday and it really is a classic! But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes

0, STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED!~: I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them. This is the first time I have had a problem with them but this none the less is an issue. Product paid for
1," Is it fragile: Anybody worry about breaking this one can go <A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here</A> and read their review. A quote: ""At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly"
0," Waste of money: 1st the ipod is expensive. It should at least come with a protective cover. 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym. Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called ""disk mode"" which freezes the unit up and cant be played. Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze. Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen"
0, DO NOT BUY!!!!: iPod Nano's are exceptionally terrible. Do not buy them unless you have a spare $200 to waste. Mine broke in 32 Days
1, IPOD NANO: I bought this iPod Nano for my 14 year old and he loves it
0, great product...for the time it lasts: I received an ipod nano 4gb as a gift. It was great other than it got WAY scratched up in about a day of usage. After having it & using it for about 3 weeks
1, Protect Your iPod: I got the Nano and ordered an acrylic cover for it from agent18.com. This is the best cover I have seen. It completely protects the nano - especially the screen. Check it out.
1, Fusion of style and functionality: I love my ipod. It is stylish

0, PRINT WAY
1, Classic is a classic: Sherlock is a classic. And here you can go along all hystories about it
0, VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult (Impossible?): The typeface is very small. This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain. These books are the latter.If microscopic print doesn't bother you
0, The Author Has An Odd Fascination: I read this book in law school. The author rejects the whipping post

1, Fits the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic exactly.: This is an easy install on the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic and should be similar on the other w203 chassis cars. Open the hood

1, Nice conclusion to the series: After reading the first two stories in this series I was looking forward to this one and wasn't disappointed. Marty while successful in her career has had bad luck in love. Nat with his arrogant background was a great character
1, Love it: When I purchased this book
0, Suspend your disbelief
0, Cliffhanger ending: I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good
0, Not brand new as described: I love time trax
1, Great Story: Sinsiter Enough to make Stephen King cringe ! Dan Simmons is top notch story teller 
0, A poor book: The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story. Looks like they are here for filling the pages.The text would have needed radical cuttings. At one point I even wondered if Simmons had written it himself; but actually it was his first novel.Slow and pointless.
0, Disappointing: After reading the Hyperion and Iluim novels
0, Dark and depressing: This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill. Likely I was not in the mood to read about the tragedies which occur in this novel but I did not enjoy this read.
0, Xenophobic garbage: I kid you not
1, Literate and Disturbing: ...this is hardly the most frightening book ever written. I wouldn't even put it in the top 10. That said
1, Drama Like I Used To Be: Loved the movie
1, Terrific Performance By A Wonderful Child Star: Patty McCormack was only a little girl when she appeared in this movie
1, Thank Heaven for Bad Little Girls.: Awesome! Patty McCormack at her best. Everyone I suggest this movie to thinks it is the best movie they ever saw.
1, Great Creepy Movie and Great Shipping: A really creepy movie and a timeless classic. The story behind the making of the film (originally was a play) is very interesting
0, Didn't work on my kindle fire: This is one of my favorite movies to watch with my mom but unfortunately it was very choppy and did not work well on my kindle fire. Amazon refunded me for my purchase though so that's good!
1, Good CD
1, Simply the best of the Bee Gees: I've been on a long search for this album and when I finally got it
1, I love this old-fashioned story: I happened upon this book by accident while cleaning out a garage and I am so glad I did. I had heard of the author years ago but didn't try to read any of her books. I'm glad it was A Lantern In Her Hand that I found.I could not put it down; reading till the wee hours of the dark a.m.
0, Bob Hoskins good actor: Can't believe I'm writing a review for this movie.Out of all the flicks I reviewed this is probably the oddest of them all.Well Mermaids isn't my kind of movie 
1, A saw every professional and handyman should have: I came to know this type of saw when I was stationed in Japan. Brought back two and unfortunately they finally had their day. Was glad to find this one. Absolutely great!
1, Spoiler Alert: I loved this film- from beginning to end I was caught up in the magic. Much has been made about the ending. I speak as someone who has been through rehab ( a car accident 3 years ago left me a quad). They got the emotions right. You don't have to agree with the choice to realize the love these characters have for each other. Being handicapped means you loose many choices
0, for scam hollywood is constantly pulling off: a separate price for wide screen/full screen versions?!?!?!?im surprised they dont have a charge for the second disc as well.the movie itself didnt capture my interest.i feel clint is a fine actor and a competent director....but his movies tend to be slow in pace and over rated.again
1, It is a boxing movie and you should see it: Kept hearing how this was not a boxing movie so I rented it to see for myself. It is a boxing movie and a good story woven into it. I felt a kinship with the character Swank plays (both from poor
0, Dehumanizing.....: This movie blatantly equates man to the level of an animal (a dog to be specific). Instead of emphasizing the fact that man as a person is important and valuable as a creation of God
0, A better idea: It would have been more believable if Hillary Swank was a model who falls off the runway and cracks her skull.This movie has no story
0, **contains spoilers**: You know
1, Multi-Layered
1, Eastwood on top of his game: Lean and spare filmaking and storytelling. The problem with movies today is the lack of good movies. Here's a great one. A professional production in every sense of the term.
1, One of my FAVORITE movies!: I own this video and it is one of the best movies in my collections. I've seen it about 50 + times and never get tired of watching certain skating scenes over and over.. not to mention the lovey parts. This is such a sweet movie! Well-written
1, the cutting edge: gold medal edition: i love the cutting edge i first seen it when i was eight and i remembered it when i looked into one of my pictures when i was five so i looked it up and bought it. i think everyone should see this movie atleast one and if it turns out to be a favorite you should buy it.
0, Boring
1, The sweetest of love stories that you'll watch over & over.: I was so pleased to see the other reviewers felt the way I did about this sappy movie. The chemistry between Kate and Doug is so realistic and the ice skating is excellent. I can watch this movie anytime
1, Better than expected!: After nearly wearing out my VHS copy
1, A Masterpiece of the Jazz Age: It is tragic that he isn't more celebrated. This is one of the best books I have ever read
1, Good movie: This is a good movie. I would suggest you watch it. Good ideas about mental healthcare and it's practices are portrayed on this movie. Jack Nicholson did a great job too.
1, Archetypes: What a timeless film. As a child you're taught shame and fear. You allow them to be your limiters until one day you wake up
1, ONeFlew over the Kuckoo Nest: As ayoung man
1, Not as good as I thought
1, what i think of one flew over the cockoo's nest: well i think that one flew over the cockoo's nest is a great movie that points out the importance of abnormality in todays society

1, Raffi is a timeless children's classic.: That's all- Raffi is a timeless children's classic. Easy to sing along to
1, Wonderfully Fun!: I don't know who loves this disc more
1, Goose vs. Gander: Glenn Smith has really done it this time. Hell hath no fury like the Bushies who have reveled for weeks in the fiction the swift boat people have dished out
0," Shameless Political Nonesense: No doubt written from the same typewritter CBS used for it's forged memos used in the 60 Minutes show. This is a transparent attempt to steal the amazing popularity of ""Unfit for Command"" a best seller by John O'Niell and Joe Corsi."
0, for some not others: This book is written by a liberal -and in my opinion-for liberals. If you are a conservative and a fan of Reagan I don't recommend it. Instead
0, Director's Cut vs Original Release: I have to agree with other reviews regarding the Director's Cut. I have both versions in VHS
1, One of the single greatest films of all time
0, ZzZzZzZzZz...: Everyone says its so great! I must have been watching a different movie. When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is
1, Director cuts out the good stuff: I have to disagree with the director and with Amazon. The voice-over was great and lent character and atmosphere to the original. Of course
0, How do you get the closed captioning to work?: Closed captioning not available...bummer! Luckily
0, I would give it zero stars if i could.: Unbelievably terrible movie
0, am i the only one who...: Am I the only one who prefers the original version? Harrison Ford's voiceover added to the film's noir feel
0," Check Your Discs!: Search the Web for ""blade runner blu-ray disc return"" and you'll find many people who got mislabeled duplicate discs. Amazon.com will help you out if you check the discs soon enough and find an issue"
0," Horrible DVD - Video quality is like unto ancient rental VHS: The movie is great the quality of this DVD is horrible. It appears to shimmy and shake as if someone were sitting in a theater with a camcorder. Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $1 bin not as a $10 item. You would be better off with VHS or perhaps LaserDisc. Wait for the rumored forthcoming ""definitive"" DVD release by Ridley Scott the director."
1, Director's Cut makes the cut: When Ridley Scott released Blade Runner in 1982
0, A less than stellar DVD: First off the Director's Cut blatantly disregards most of the book especially at the end. But since I am inclined to base my rating on the DVD itself
1, AMERICA'S CRITIC: I LOVED THIS ONE IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME MY FULL REVEIW WOULD JUST BE A WASTE JUST OWN THIS MOVIE AND THATS THAT!!!!
1, excellent Blue Ray movie: This 5 disk set for $27 is a good deal. 3 blue ray disks and two DVD disks are in the box.
0, A true classic that deserves better...: Bladerunner is still one of the finest cyberpunk movie ever made(Fifth Element don't even come close). When it was first aired
1, Old vs. New: While received poorly at the box office upon first release
0, @@@@ WARNING @@@@@: BUYER BEWARE ! i ordered this 5 disc blu ray from usa. now i wished i hadn't. it started out being cheaper than ordering from my country canada. it arrived today and disc 5 had a huge crack all the way from the top layer to the bottom. the crack runs from the inner hole to the outside edge. also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut. i wished i'd read these reviews first. shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
1, Amazon needs to sell the original version: The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together
0, new dvd: Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
1, Another great movie to bring back great memories: Another fantastic movie that came around at a time when this kind of thing was a lot more possible in peoples' imagination than it is nowadays.Great actors
1, HD-DVD Final Cut review: This is a review of the HD-DVD Blade Runner Final Cut only. To put it in prospective I have the Laser Disk and the Director's Cut on DVD.If you have an upscaling DVD player then there is not too much visual improvement to the orginal Director's Cut DVD. What has really improved is the Dolby 5.1 sound. The improvement in the sound quality in the regular Director's Cut to a HD-DVD
0, Bring back the Theatrical Release: I saw the original theatrical release of Blade Runner and was dismayed years later to learn that the director's cut omits Harrison Fords narrative. Why was the narrative removed? I don't get it.... I want to buy a new
0, Studio Got Lazy On This One: Warner Bros. shouldn't have released the Director's Cut by itself. They should have released a Criterion Collection containing the Director's Cut
0, I don't understand the hype.: With all the hype this movie is supposed to be like the best movie ever. It's just okay but with such high expectations I'm not impressed.It gets an extra star because it has a very beautiful woman and a good soundtrack.
0, still searching: is it possible to buy the original theatrical version of blade runner on dvd without buying the 5 disc set????
1, No.1 cult movie: This one has it all;sci-fi
1, Bladerunner special edition is awesome.: This is impossible to find in Brick&Mortar's anymore
1, Blade Runner: This movie is not one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever done
0," ZERO star rating: I probably should have payed closer attention to what the ""directors cut"" did not include. I thought the other version with Sean Young and Harrison Ford flying off together was definitely a four star rating. And that unicorn dream sequence? Whats up with that? My advice... don't waste your money on this one."
1, oh
1, The Best Sci-fi Movie Ever: Blade Runner (director's cut) has to be my favorite movie; it's special effects and setting are still visually stunning after 20 years
1, Really good pursuit
0, Missing something...: Why don't they take Lawrence Sanders' name off the McNally books? Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth
1, Byrds rock the fillmore: Byrds live at the fillmore is a great live album from the byrds at Fillmore east and features some of the best songs performed live amd is highly recommended.
1," Story Not As Good As ""What's Up"
1, GREAT TALENT: THIS CD GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS MORE THEN ONE TALENT IN THE GROUP PUBLIC ENEMY A GREAT CD WITH SOME GREAT BASS AND RYMES

0, what the hell did he just say: Why did Bush knock down the towers??I can't believe he said that sh*t.This guy is an idiot
1," ""Good Carpenter Documentary DVD!"": John Carpenter: The man who brought you ""Halloween"
0," many flaws outweigh fun: The game includes nowhere to store the black sheets for the ""screen"". The storage drawer jams every time you close it so opening it tends to result in pegs flying all over the room. You can turn the light on but not off; I seem to recall that we had on/off light technology even way back when I was a kid. The pegs don't stay in well"
0, Over-Hyped: Despite the advertising
0, TOO LAME!!: I think it is pathetic that both parties go at it here in the review section. I look to read customer reviews. Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues. I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd's lack of commentary!! And NO
1," They should hav had more stuff!: the dvd's sound really great and i give it a 4/5 rating with all the extra stuff in it but it could have been a 5! they should have put those 3 video clips that started all this ! i wanted to see ""American History"""
1, Classic South Park Goodness...Nothing More
1, Great start
1, Read the last 150 pages in one sitting: I was so into this book I read the last 150 pages in one sitting.
0, Awful piece of junk!: My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday. I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster. How difficult would it have been for the designers to actually figure a way for the arms to lock in place?? They do not stay in the back at all. This toy has since caused tears and frustration. Don't buy this piece of junk!
0, Not reader friendly: I should have paid attention to other reviews. Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel. If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required. Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents. I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it. Will probably just delete it.
0, Unorganized impossible to navigate: Save your dollar. The kindle edition does not have any ability to easily navigate. You will essentially have to manually wade through the extensive collectioin of Poe stories which is cubersome and ineffecient. As well
1, This joint gets 10 mikes: For 80deca
1, These aren't my clothes...: When friends come over for movie night
1, One of my favorites: Written my Tarantino this film is one of my favorites and my favorites of his. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are excellent in it
0, Check what region your in....: Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
1, A DVD review: This DVD doesn't have much to offer other than a great movie with a bunch of cameos from some big name actors. A good DVD to have in the collection if you liked the film.
1, A classic: I grew up listening to Raffi
1, Great songs! Our children love Raffi: If you haven't been introduced to Raffi
1, I LOVE this CD (oh
0, I know he's popular -- but I can't stand to hear his voice!: I know that Raffi is one of the most popular kid's singers. You can't go into a kids music section without seeing his face everywhere. I tried to like him
1, ruler in the rapgame: foreshadowed and epitomized the pimpster attitude of many rappers during the late '80s and '90s
1," love it but 4 stars not 5: Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating ""when I was a young boy..."" then something he did to get in trouble"
0, Doesn't Matter: The first 2/3 of this movie are spent developing the characters of Liu Xing and Prof Reiser and then all the strongest character traits of those two people are just tossed aside for the ridiculous ending. That made the entire film a complete waste of time. You're left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why. Anyone with a shred of intellect isn't going to be moved by this except maybe to anger at having squandered 90 minutes on it. It could have been a decent movie. It did have a really cheap quality about it as you never see ANY other students at the school.
1, great movie!!: Very powerful and artistic movie
0, Not one of her better ones!!: As I have a collection of all of Meryl Streep's movies
0, Defected Book!: 1 star because the book was deffected!This book arrived on time and was in excellent condition. Upon reading the book to my daughter I noticed the pages were out of order. Please contact me so that I may persue getting another copy.
1, Excellent and Interesting: This book is a highly readable work of scholarship
0, HOLY JESUS!: What the (blank) happened to Pete Nice? I had always wondered what happened to the Prime Minister after 3rd Bass imploded. I knew Serch put out a CD but I never even knew Pete did until recently. Sadly.... now I know why! I could barely even listen to this CD and haven't touched it since. If you wore out your 3rd Bass tapes back in the day and want to hear Prime Minister in action again... Just get the 3rd Bass CD's and forget this crap! Oh don't believe me?? Check out how much it's selling for.***UPDATE*** 01/24/13I've listened to this CD several hundred times since 2005 and I'll admit it.... I WAS WRONG! The Lumberjack
1, 4.5 stars actually: first of all
0, Avoid this seller!: We ordered this camera for our daughter. We have never had any issues with having things arrive from Amazon sellers but this camera came to us in a flat rate envelope wrapped in bubble wrap. Nothing else. No original box either
1, Canon Powershot digital camera: I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! The pictures are sharp and clear
0, workmanship: The workmanship in this 6th Edition is less than satisfactory. Several of my fellow seminar students had their books split upon opening the front cover of the hardback. Apparently
1, An Essential Book: There are very few books that are essential for one's personal library
1, This is what i'm waiting for!!!!: In Flames and Soilwork are sold out
0," Disappointing Book: What about reading about an artwork:""This painter is in its best. His paint is full of movement and color"
0, Interesting but with one MAJOR flaw: An interesting author who knows his art but I found this a frustrating book to read because Hoving describes one great piece of artwork after another but only a small number are actually illustrated. Even a bad picture is better than no picture. The author tries his best but the beauty of words just don't measure up to the beauty of the artwork. Next time
1, GREAT SOUND...GREAT VALUE: It was time to replace my 25 year old Technics towers. I wanted something much smaller
1, Very nice: I got these speakers promptly and they are indeed a first class product. The first thing I noticed was howheavy they are. These things must have some serious magnets in them. FWTW. They really do sound good thoughSony nailed this deal.
1, Exceptional speakers: Recently bought the Sony SS-B3000 speakers. As many have mentioned are a little larger than most bookshelf speakers. However
0, Sony Speakers: Ordered Sony Speakers per a good review online. They arrived on time
0," Reading this book was hardly worth the struggle.: Lucia Robson St.Clair's novels have always been in the ""can hardly put it down"" catagory but this recent novel""Mary's Land"" set in early Maryland history was a struggle to read. The story began with the promise of another wonderful historical drama but after the main characters landed in the colonies and began their new life"
1, Byrds Untitled originally vinyl 2 LP set.: The Byrds UntitledA valuable part of my Byrds music library that used to have as a vinyl 2 LP set. I am rebuilding the Byrds music library with CDs.
1, THREE AND A HALF STARS
1, I loved this CD!: In moments of creativity
1, A different album from Paula- yet a much needed one.: I'm a little surprised that so many people would come on to post such negativities about this new album or about Paula herself. I have been a fan of hers for well over 3 years
0," Paula Morissette?: This is Ms. Cole's worst offering. I totally loved ""This Fire"" and most of ""Harbringer"". This album is laced with Mariah Carey sounding vocals (who's doing the high stuff? - NOT Ms. Cole)"
0, sucks: overrated fan. just go to lowes or home depot and save money and get something you can return in person.
1, Miracle cure: I have suffered from insomnia for close to 8 years. After trying every herbal remedy available
1, Excellent: This is an excellent sleep aid. Although my sleeep problem had not been fallng asleep
1, Impressive Sleep CD: I have finally found an effective safe method of getting a restful night's sleep. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has ever had a fitful night's sleep.Jonathan Rubin
1," Perfect Background Music for a Bachelor's Pad: While ""Night Lights"" would be perfect for a romantic evening"
0, High Hunt by David Eddings: Not a too great book
0, Waste Of Money!: A lot of the book was based on any breed. In the training section
0, Don't do it.: When I built my computer
1, In a class all his own: I learned a lot about playing blues piano from listening to Ray Bryant (not that I know 1/100th of what Bryant knows....). Bryant has a style all his own. He is a master cook. All the tracks on this classic disk swing
1, Perfection: I
1, my 2nd fav. by her: I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events
0, Poor Customer Service: I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked. Tried to return it and was given the run around for almost two months. They told me to send it to amazon
1, Cat's Eye: This is one of the many Stephen King classics. Definately should be on DVD for future generations to enjoy. A riveting tale of a cat's quest to teach errie lessons and save the day. Looking forward to the DVD!
1, Scooter Mirror: This is a well made and super easy to install mirror
1, Solid and sharp: I had to cut the grip on my handlebars to install the mirror but it works great. It looks solid and visibility is excellent. Tightened up secure
1, Best Mirror on the Market!: My Mirrycle MTB is now on it's second bike. I did have to replace the mirror part after dropping the bike...no fault of the mirror itself. It stays in place and gives a wide view of what's behind you.
1, Nice mirror for the price
1, Mirrycle MTB Bicycle Mirror: A great value and looks cool on my bicycle. It comes complete with detailed instructions and the appropriate Allen Wrench. The instructions call for using a knife to cut away the covering at the end of your handle bar. For a much safer installation
0, Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality????: My last Mirrycle was purchased some 21 years ago and used on the same bike until recently when it broke.The same new one arrives from Amazon
0, Cheap and horrible design: I mounted this mirror on my bike
1, Great mirror!: I've had one of these mirrors on my bike for seven years. I liked it so much that I ordered one for my husband's new bike. It's easy to install and a tough little mirror. It's been crunched several times and I'm always able to readjust it just fine.
1, Great Little Mirror!: Bought a couple of these for our bicycles.Had to slightly modify my handlebar grip to install.When installed
1, Works with a road bike!: I bought this for my road bike and it fits in the end of the drop bar. I left out the middle piece and it works well. The only potential problem would be in case of a fall
1, A must have: And after a mile of riding after mounting this
1, Great Bicycle Mirror: This is a great Bicycle Mirror
1, Good mirror: This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface
1, Mirrycycle mryycle: I have owned these mirrors for years. They can be positioned under the left handlebar also
0, Poor Quality -- A Name Brand Signifying Nothing Today: Well
0, Flip Album:(: This company has a set of business ethics which are questionable. The owner of Flip Books (EBooksystems) plasters their name and links to their website all over your finished work.
0, Disco is Over: I always considered myself the ultimate Donna Summer Fan..butwhen this long awaited Geffen release hit the air waves I knewDisco was over..I have never been so disappointed in an album..even though I remember the first time I heard Hotstuff its hard rock edge I knew things were changing...
1," Donna's not just a Disco Queen: ""The Wanderer"

0, Morbid Ending: If you're expecting Mark Twain's usual funny and cheerful stories
0, HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!: DO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!! IF YOU WANT A FUN BOOK TO READ
0, Not What I Expected: I've purchased loads of stuff from Amazon and have been happy with my purchases. This is my first disappointment. First
0, Not as good as Mame: I watched Mame with Lucille Ball and enjoyed it very much. Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell was such a let down that it has been a struggle to watch the whole film. Perhaps it is because Miss Russell looks like she is acting and Miss Ball IS Mame. Or it could be that there is no music or singing in Auntie Mame
0, Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: I just don't get it. I had heard so much about this movie
0, Lucille Balls version was much better....: I found the movie Auntie Mame a huge dissapointment.If you enjoyed Auntie Mame I highly suggest that you see MAME which is a musical version of Auntie MAME and Stars Lucille Ball.MAME is one hundred million times better.
1, A bit of Sunshine in a Box: I had an Auntie Mame in my life and before she died recently I gave her a copy of this movie and we watched it together and laughed and reminisced together and just enjoyed the movie and each other's company. Then she was gone. I'll always treasure that day and the memories I made with my Auntie Mame. Don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy true entertainment - and have a few tissues handy too!
1," A CLASSIC!: I always look at this film around Christmas time. It never lets me down for getting me into the holiday mood. One of the greatest comedies ever made. From Agnes Gooche's ""How Bleak Was My Puberty"""
1, Great Wireless Headphones !: This set of headphones is just right. Good plastic; headgear that is not overly fussy; responsive buttons with good button feel. Tuning is immediate
1, Love this product!: Product great. Had one small problem with the product. But seller turned around and made it right. Very quick. I would buy from this seller anytime!!!!
1, good christmas songs: This is a good cd. It has some traditional christmas music
1, Electric Light Orchestra - Part II - One Night Live in Australia '95: The title of this DVD is misleading
1, Excellent: Kneipp's bath oils are the best on the market. This is my particular favorite
0, Better
1," So warm and cozy!!!!: I live in New York and find the winters a little tough for my ""little tootsies"". I moved here from California and never know my feet could get so cold. However"
1," search this out please!: it's so amazingly brilliant/pretty.even my acquaintances who don't like shoegazey stuff likethis. ""something goes wrong"" is one of the mostappallingly good and simple songs i have ever heard.the stars of this band were the drummer jim goodall(a monster!) and of course braddy the brat (brilliant"
0, A young girl experiences world war 2 as a jewish girl: This book was very interesting. The topic at least. Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad. Th plot skipped around alot so unless you can understand difficult reading I would not recommend it.
1, Engaging: This book gives you a good look into what the people on our police forces go through every day of their lives. Its enough to make a person wonder why anyone would ever decide to do this job.
1, I can still quote this book years later: This is such a memorable book I can still quote it years after reading it. For example
1," Couldn't put it down...: I thought the stories in this book were good for the length of each one. I have to say that ""Captivated by You"" was the best of all three. If you like short"
1, Excellent Book
0, Does not work with Lifeproof Iphone Case: I just received the dock extender and it does not work with the LifeProof case. Has anyone gotten it to work with the Lifeproof case? It does not seem to be long enough to reach the phone.
0, Great Film
0, &#65533;I Am Not Amused&#65533;: Watching The Gold Rush
0, This DVD is pure garbage. I plan to use it as a coaster.: Don't waste your money on this one. The transfer is so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. This movie is a classic and it is just a shame that the producers of this DVD obviously have no respect for it. This is the last time I buy anything from this company.
0, ZZZZZZZZZZZ: Carly couldn't have selected a worse bunch of songs to cover. Oh Suzanna...come on now! Same dull monotone throughout the cd. One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime.
1, Simply Beautiful!: listening to this spare yet very elegant album is a joy indeed! goes to show why we fell in love with Carly in the first place.
1," ""Wings Over America"" shows the band could really rock: For Christmas 1976"
1, Definitive In Many Many Ways: This is one of the best live recordings of McCartney I have ever heard
1, Shark is right: This saw cuts fast and straight. I cut PT 5x5's flat and straight no problem. Pulling to cut lends to accuracy and ease. Handle sucked
0, one of Mandys worst movies: This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies. Her acting was good
1, Great product
0," How long will this be ""Under Review"" ?: I have been waiting to be able to purchase this for weeks now"
1, performing betty in the crucible: My name is Marissa and this freshman year of my high school career i am playing betty from the crucible. because of this experience
1, On the subject of symbolism in 'The Crucible': I enjoyed this play very much. Although historically relevant to the salem witch trials in my opinion this play's meaning had little to do with them. What I see Miller focusing on is more the symbolism of the events transpiring within and their relation to modern events (e.g. The Mcarthy Trials). While portraying what happened in Salem during that era
1, The book showed how stupid and gulable people can be.: The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything. The people pointing the finger were very quick to judge and very quick to accuse. The book was kind of almost unreal. It was hard to believe. I know that it was based on what really happened
0, Missing Lines: This was supposed to be an unabridged version. It is not. Thus
1, Great Sound: worth the money for sure would buy any Onkyo product any time very high quility for the money move over sony you got company
1, EXCELLENT: THIS HAS BEEN GREAT. IT PLAYS WELL AND IS EASY TO OPERATE. I COULD NOT FIND ONE IN TOWN
0, Look elsewhere: The other morning
0, Very Disappointed: Worked great when first connected to receiver / speakers. Then it just stopped working. Couldn't even remove my CD's that were inside. Amazon refunded my money
0, quality control: save your money folks. this one aint nothing but a paperweight. very poor quality control. only good thing is I'm returning within 30 days so I can get my money refunded.

1, 2nd in a terrific family saga series: It's not easy to find this book anymore - I got it at my library but had to special-order it from another branch. The series has two different numbering systems - one by order written
0, The worst creatures in the world.: Yuck! How can they do that
1, Magnetic to children: This is the first time I have purchased Raffi in CD format. I have bought many tape copies over the years as gifts for many children. I have travelled by car all over the North American continent with my own children and this music made the trips fun. It was the only music we still played after a trip! I feel like the music helps them put feelings and thoughts into contexts that they can understand. It also entertains the adults. After once through the songs
1, Great Head Unit: Pioneer makes some great auto head units and this is no exception
1, Excellent: This was the best and perhaps the most slow books of the series but I absolutely loved it? Who IS Taran?
1, An excellent and heartfelt story
1, A Children's Classic: Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo
1, AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Thank you for replacing the movie that you sent me with a brand new MILLION time better copy of it! was a great package to come home to! it made my daughters day
1," Disney's Sleeping Beauty on Blu-Ray: History repeats itself! ""Sleeping Beauty"" was the first animated Disney film to be released on VHS tape (*many* moons ago)"
1, Sleeping Beauty: What a wonderful movie. Reminded me of watching when I was a kid and so happy to have found it again for my kids.
0, Okay Film - Poor Extras: This was sneaked out onto release on region 2 disc ages ago in England (minus commentary). Although the film is visually stunning and has some nice set pieces it lacks warmth and
0, Beware! Digital flaw: Everything about this release is wonderful except that it has a manufacture digital flaw. Both our original and replacement had the exact same digital flaw
1, the most amazing masterpiece of animation ......ever/: i can only say 
1, Sleeping: I love this movie. It's one of my favorite earlier Disney films. I love all of the colors and the music. I personally think that this is one of Disney's better Fairy Tale adaptation. The movie just really flowed well with every thing.
1, sleeping beauty: It was so easy to order and the product came earlier that I thought. My greatgrandaughter was so delighted it was in excellent shape and the process was effertless. I have since order other products from Amazom. thank you for excellect service.
1, Wonderful Film. Excellent Extras.: ALL of the short film Extras are on the Second Disk. If you want any Extras
0, Disappointed...: I was more than thrilled to pay the $70 dollars to own this timeless classic
1, Excellent Buy!: Made my first batch this morning. I added bananas and pecans. Excellent! I highly recommend this mix if you are in the market for a gluten free muffin mix.
1, Gluten free mix: Kids and I love this. Texture is great. We use it to make scones and kids ask for it all the time.
1, I'm no R&B fan
0, Deceptively surprising: The many good customer reviews encouraged me to buy this book
1, agama tantra : my hands and yours: This is the most helpful tool I have encounterd for use in prayer.The illustrations are very exact and obviously extremely well studied. Kleen's texts are invaluable to the western practitioner of agama hindu bali(Agama Tirtha).
0, Just Dang Perplexing: I have a deep and abiding respect for blacks
1, Donald Goines-Excellent Writer: I read this book when I was 13 years old. I was so impressed with this book that I read his entire collection of writings.I am now an adult and have encouraged my teenage children to read them as well.All of his writings are highly recommended. It will make you cry and laugh and I guarantee that you will not be able to put them down.
1, Hubba hubba hot stuff: So Mars needs men to repopulate? If they all look like this babe
0, Devil Girl * a very Bad copy: This isn't really a review of the movie but rather a review of the video sent out. My copy was so bad (just simply too dark) I could not see any the player in the scene. I would guess it just over copied
1, Nearly perfect example of the genre!!: That is
1, A high quality album for lovers of good soul music: 'Sleep Talk' and 'My love is so raw' are the stand out dance tracks for the more energetic among you
0, take it from me: this suction cup did not work at all i was very disappointeda waste of money on the dent i was using it for i put the suction cup on it and started pulling but the dent didnt go any where you could tell that it was tryna work but it didnt
0, A time to kill: This is not a full sized book. It was a little more worn than what was noted. I did received it before the arrival date and I would order from this company again
0, Came Bent: I was excited to get this to put on the wall in my playroom for magnets for the kids. But the item came bent so i had to send it back. I know that what I wanted to use it for was not the intended use for this item
0, sorry.......: i have to say that i am sorry for letting this go on this long...you see
1," longer version: this book is packed with info.. it's the longer version of ""a brief history"" and how your prof. has so much info..that's not showing up in your shorter text (if you're getting the brief version) it has a lot of pics..and maps..and is easy to read.. very informative ..text book"
1, FIRST MP3: The screen is very nice and easy to view
1, Its what I wanted!: I am very pleased
0, Where Eagles Dare: Did not like this movie. It might have some juvenile appeal but certainly not for someone in touch with reality. lol
1, Broadsword calling Danny Boy...: Clint and Richard in the perfect movie to watch on xmas day! Great script
1, A great movie about how the Americans outfoxed the Germans: The movie was well made and how the Americans thought that they had captured the right person
0, Monotone: Great movie
0, Messy Air: It starts off pretty well
1, Expensive: A valuable book in this field. Better and fuller text than most Quimper books. Along with the average color photos
0, Inexpensive but be careful: The previous reviews are all correct. Inexpensive
1, For once a product worth more than cost: I have seen fancier watch winders made from elegant wood and perhaps of finer craftsmanship which are offered at costs for a double winder (which this is) starting at multiples of the cost of this product. I have had the item for two weeks and it is a fantastic value. It offers settings to wind both clockwise and counter-clockwise and an on/off switch which I shut off at night.It also winds for one hour and rests for three. A whole lot of features and great bang for the buck!! I keep it in an unobtrusive place and it is surprsingly quiet. The vendor (AA Store) provided outstanding service and I am hard-pressed to imagine any buyer of this winder not being delighted with it. Even the finest timepiece (I only own a watch) would not object to a home in this winder...perhaps not elegant
0, Very loud!: I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!! We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.
0, I would not buy it again: At first
1, The hit of Xmas - why did I wait so long?: Since a kid I've wanted one of these - put them in my grandchildren's stockings - what a hit! What a cool call! Simple but effective - I will now finally order one for myself!
1, Feeling Mellow: This is a great CD when you're feeling mellow or slightly sad. Nonetheless
0, Urgh! Ruined by an Americanisation!: This book is beautifully illustrated
0, HELL NO NOBODY TAKES THE NAME FROM 2PAC: nobody takes the light out of tupac and sais all eyes on us....First of all
0, WTMI: I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through. Not to make light of the level of human suffering the author was attempting to expose but I found it repetitive and exasperating. The author felt it necessary to wallow in the details and belabor the point by taking each individual involved and describe their role in the account or suffering separately and in meticulous detail. I wanted to shout at the author “I got it already” now get on with the story or as my daughter is fond of saying “WTMI” (Way too much information)
1, Outstanding: I reside in Texas and have personal knowledge of the immigration situation from a different view than that reflected in the book. It very much humanizes this situation and makes one aware that these are real people with families and a history.
1, A third novel that surpasses its predecessors.: Hugh Holton is a Chicago police officer who uses a vivid imaginationand a good sense of story telling to weave some prettydifferent mysteries set in a realistic Chicago background.While it is generally helpful to have read Presumed Dead andWindy City
1, I have really entered the dru.: Since the day my girlfriend introduced this group to me
1, Don't Sleep On This Album
1, THiS iS mY FaVoRiTe CD Of aLL TiMe!!: Dru Hill definetly did it again.. These 4 men are ASTOUNDING! I love them! They are so amazingly talented!! I've had this CD since it came out in '98 and it hasn't moved from my CD player! This album is AWESOME! Anyone who hasn't bought it
1, It was off tha hizzie shizzie: This cd was really good. It was just amazing! And of course they are too. All of them! Anyone who does not have this cd needs to go out and get it. I am glad that I bought it.
1, lightweight and it works: If you are looking for a lightweight trimmer this is the one. It is a good length and it is one of the handiest garden tools I have. Highly recommend.
1, Best I've Found So Far: My four year old son will sit and watch this even though he insists he does not want to learn Chinese and prefers to watch cartoons. It moves pretty slowly
1, a six star album: Weezy
0, Best rapper alive? HAHAHAHAHAHA: Yea dont make me laugh
1, I love Lil Wayne: I think Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers alive.I haven't been a big fan of Lil Wayne until I heard him with Young Money now I love everything about him.All of his albums are the bomb including this one.Anyone who doesn't love his flow and his style is a hater.Lil Wayne keep doin it big don't let these haters slow u down.
1, Lil Wayne beats all of his other albums: Think about it...if birman and mannie fresh put alot of work in this album it's got to be great. The problem is it's not an album that you can listen to over and over again.
0, Lil Wayne is a Lil Wack!: this guy is a pathetic excuse for a rapper
1, Didn't expect to find this classic: This game is a diamond. Fun
0, Looks Tough: Looks are deceiving. I haven't taken this item out on any serious adventure yet but out of the box it feels rather flimsy. The light in the back that swivels is tough to maneuver and I think it will probably break off sometime. The front light is kind of dim. The radio and flasher are OK. Everything works as supposed to
1, A worthwhile investment!: I have to disagree with the prior review of this album. Yes
1," A Great Season - A Limited DVD: SciFi 's (hereafter 'Skiffy') quixotic post-cancellation rerun schedule has forced die-hard ""Farscape"" fans to invest in sets of DVDs. Unfortunately"
0, Yawner: The DVD is great in quality for picture and sound. The CD does not have near as good quality. There are no suprises here and a live cd should not be made by Coldplay...why? because the songs are the exact same as they are on the album. All of their songs follow the same structure
0, You have got to be kidding me!: I loved Coldplay's other two albums
0, DVD Problem: The rate would be a good 4
1, EXCELENT DVD
1, 1 of Da BEST Hip Hop Albumz Eva!!!: This album is 1 of the best Hip Hop albums ive listened to in awhile
1, EXCELLENT: These boys are having their best year ever! After putting out Necroshine(5 stars
1, Incredible healthy
1, Combat lighting: This light was highly rated here and on Youtube! I use it on my Mossberg 12 ga thunder ranch shotgun. It's very light in weight and great in a home defense situation.
1, Excellent flashlight. I strapped one to mod 22 glock 22 handgun
0, Out-of-print for a reason!: The premise of this book
1, Building with Nature--Review: This is a very important reexamination of the American origins of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the major contibutions of a small group of Bay Area designers. The central role is occupied by the Reverend Joseph Worcester who created one of the true landmarks of the movement with the Church of the New Jerusalem in San Francisco. The author provides new context and a great amount of new reseach. This book is a major accomplishment.
0, Am police and religons expert: it is inaccurate.: Having served as expert witness in comparative religions
1, Steve Perry is AMAZING!: LOVVVVVEEE this cd. Steve Perry is outstanding. His vocal range is truly one of a kind and cannot be duplicated. Great music!!!!!
1, Love ol Jerry Lee: Being in my teens in the 50's 
0, Tedious!: Maxwell's writing is enjoyable but the restraint of his characters makes the story very slow-moving and boring. Reading this book was a chore
1, Ultra-heavy techno-metal with evil fury: I love this cd. I found out about this little known band thru an industrial website link...I'm glad I kept track with the band and got this cd. The best songs are Cannibal:Burn
1," A Good Collection Of Cindy Morgan's Music: I remember a couple of my favorite Cindy Morgan songs that did not make this collection: ""Love Will Break Your Fall"" and ""Reason To Live"". Are there any songs out of these 14 that should be taken off to make room for one of these two? Not really. That means this is a good collection.Besides the two I mentioned"
1, Her Best is as Good as Anybody Else!!: While from album to album
0, A bitter disappointment: This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted. Like another reviewer here said
1, 10 Stars: On the edge of your seat excitement
1, great movie: This is a great movie to watch. If you like happy endings
1, Good story line: Starts a little slow
0, Terrible movie a waste of 2 hours: If your into an endless chase movie without any real plot or substance than this movie is for you. The movie runs forever without any fluidity to the storyline. Bruce willies
0," Be prepared for a warped movie: The back of the DVD case called the movie a ""wickedly funny"" tale. Not true at all. It is one of those very warped movies"
0, Great cast
1, True Story
0, Not a comedy
0, Running With Scissors: Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story
0, What A Mess!: Like others
0, Sorry: While this review won't be very detailed
1, Amazing: This game is amazing. It takes an incredible amount of strategy and skill. There are always decisions to be made. Buy it
1, Excellent for the price!: This an excellent comforter for the price! The down pockets are evenly spaced and plumply filled but the down still moves around a bit between squares and it takes a lot of time to wiggle the down back into the center of the comforter. The feather pillows that came free with this in November took nearly 3 months to arrive. The cover is soft and the comforter is very comfortable.
0, BEWARE Cut Version!: I sold this DVD version of Wayne's Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary. And where was the documentary cut at? All the interviews with the Mexican actors
1, great movie: The Duke's Alamo is a fine film. So is Walt Disney's Davy Crockett and the 2004 Alamo with Billy Bob Thorton as a fine Davy Crockett. You can't beat all of these for excellent historical adventures.
0, The Alamo with John Wayne: Having seen the wide-screen version
0," To Commit Treason...: If I may commit treason in the eyes of all John Wayne fans--this was NOT the movie for him! Most of his roles (most notably ""True Grit"") he just fits into"
1, Great Film!: The Alamo is a masterpiece from John Wayne. Any controversy over this film is overblown and outdated. Who really paid for the keg of Corn Liquor that got blown up by the cannonball
0, Honor
0, Not the Director's Version: I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did. This is not that beautiful director's cut which was issued on Laser and VHS. If that is what you are looking for
0, Do Not Recommend: Unfortunately is stopped working a month or so after I bought it at Target. I called the manufacturer and was told to send it to the repair center at my cost and wait 6 -8 weeks until they fix it and return it to me. Very poor customer service too
1, hard swingin: Everyone is taking long
1, Scars and All: I have been trying to get this song on CD since I heard Jeff sing it on Crooks and Chase in 98. It absolutely moved me to tears and so perfectly described my relationship with my boyfriend. I was thrilled to read in Country Weekly Jeff is coming back - am anxiously waiting for his new album. What a talent. His CDs will be stacked right under George Strait
0," Cornwell can do better: I was reading through some of the reader reviews and one reviewer called Marino the most ""put together"" character in the book and I realized with a start that this was true! How unexpected that this overeating"
1, Captivating
0, Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell: I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with
0, Let's put it together: Over 300 reviews so far
0, Could be better....: well
0, There is No Hope: Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job
1, Exciting continuation of Cornwell's talent.: I had read reviews of this book that were not good and almost skipped this one
0, black notice: I have read all of her books. The last two have been just terrible. She has lost her touch. Try Nelson Demille- he is outstanding!
0, Bad plot & character development
1, Overall
1, Great Book one more for a great series: Ok I was reading the reviews and I think alot of peeps are giving this book a bad review. The book has twists and turns but also has a startling sense of reality. It shows that not everyone deals with things the same way. and if you think about it Kay has got a lot to deal with .... How many men in her life has she lost now 4-5 and the romances take a lot out of her because when she loves she loves with all her heart unless shes scared... and everything thats happening in the end just leads to a greater plot in the next Book I cant wait to read The Last Precient
0, Don't waste your time !: I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before
0, Continued Disappointment: A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately
0, Unless you're into frustration
0, Full of holes and threads that peter out.: The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together
0," Better than ""Point of Origin"" -- but could it be worse?: Okay"
1, Anywhere she is....: Patricia Cornwell may take you to a city street in Virginia or to a country across the ocean
0, Terrible: I am midway through Black Notice
0, Cornwell needs to push the narrative.: A few years ago I discovered this series. Mystery mixed with forensic science made for an interesting story. Also you cared about Kay
0, The Downward Slide Continues: In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series
0, A disappointment: Ever the optimist
1, Great characters and wonderful suspense.: I really like this book. I found myself invested in liking certain characters
0, Black Angst: As a long-time mystery and Scarpetta/Cornwell fan
0, I was disappointed in the plot & characterization: I keep wanting to like these books. I don't. Kay is not a likeable person. Marino is not a likeable person (is he even a person?). Lucy is the personification of a snotty brat. Who is the winner?
0, Don't Bother: Patricia Cornwell's books
0, What's the Name of this Book Again?: I bought the audio version of this book - I'm 3 tapes down - and I keep asking myself if I've already read it. I came to Amazon.com to make sure this was Patricia Cornwell's latest book. Nothing in Black Notice is very original. It's all a repeat of Postmortem and Body of Evidence. Very disappointing.
0, get a life!!: ms cornwell's stories are interesting
0, Dismal: While each of the vignettes suggests a possibly interesting story
0, I can write better: I might as well read my own juicy but amateur stories for some entertainment. Vreeland's writing was dry dry dry. No magic
1, Follow that painting!: Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book
1, Unique and beautiful...: Susan Vreeland beautifully tells the fictitous tale of a piece of artwork by J. Vermeer. We follow the piece back in time through eight stories of previous owners until we end with the hardships of Vermeer himself.Each story transports you to the time and place of the artworks owner. You begin to understand them through the eyes they cast on this particular work of art as it illuminates moments of their lives making them and the art unforgettable.
1, A Book of Short Stories: This book is really a book of short stories woven together and proceeding backwards chronologically to trace the provenance of the painting. The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other
1, a must read: although this book was in print quite a few years agoi must say its one you can reread and enjoy time and again
0, Contrived: Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book
1," Incredible!: I know what you're thinking. Is this going to be one of those artsy ""literary experiences"" where almost nothing happens? NO! Incredibly"
1, Art and Literature: If you've ever held and antique in your hand
1, A Timeless Piece: The depth of this master piece is timeless for all generations to come. Compared to what we are having on the market today
1, Dr Zhivago: Great movie to begin with and this 2 disc set was especially nice. I enjoyed watching the old interviews with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie which were conducted back at the time of the original theatrical release.
0, Doctor Zhivago DVD Poor Quality: I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.
1, Those eyes: Lean made beautiful movies. He told good stories. And Julie's eyes can drown you. A movie the story of an observer. One of the good ones. Images you keep.
1, Sweeping historical epic: A sweeping portayal of love and betrayal in the chaos of the Russian revolution. One of the great epics.
1," Bite me: Buffy's not your averege girl. Well she used to be the sterotypical Valley girl who's main concern was shopping and her equally shallow boyfriend. Then she meets the man who claims to be her ""watcher"" and says that she is the Chosen one"
0, Watch This Atrocious Movie At Your Risk: ....Perhaps if I hadn't become addicted to the far superior television series before I saw it
1, The Ultimate Rom-Com with Vampires in the Valley: With the exception of Luke Perry's painful portrayal of a 20-something year car mechanic turned love interest
0, Nothing new for anyone: Only women who need feminist bravado to feel secure in their womanhood will find this bok useful because it repeats what these sad women need to hear. For the more well rounded woman who's secure in herself
0, Batteries Not Fresh?: I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately
1, Great Look at the NBA in the 70s: Bill Bradley does an amazing job of showing what the NBA was like in the 1970s from the small details of what the locker room was like to how race relations impacted the players on his team. His player profiles were so insightful and I particularly enjoyed his looks at non-teammate greats like Oscar Robertson
0, Does not work: The first four seasons were great. Did not want the episodes to end.This one you cant wait for it yo end.
0, Stick to the first three series: The first three seasons are wonderful! However......after season 3 they try and try....and try...to recapture the magic of the first three and never do.
0, Kindle edition NOT good: It does not read well
1, A good Christian understanding of numerology: I borrowed this book from a friend
1, Another Very Good Book!: I very much enjoyed this book. It covers many areas and is full of good info. Not a generic book with the word dachshund filled into the blanks. Lots of nice colour photos.
0, Not really good: While the first two seasons were very successful
0, Karma intended for plots to be simple: Karma intended for formulas and plots to be simple. My Name is Earl was never screened on television where I came from for a pretty good reason - the story-line was dumb
1, An extensive reference
1, Journey....We Have A Problem: Even though this re-release sounds better than previous ones
1, Charlie's place: Nothing better then to listen to the music of one of Rock & Rolls legendary voices of all time! Steve Perry!! He has a soulful commanding voice!!
1, Bobby taught Soul 1 everything he knows: Yes folks
1, Loved Loved Loved this book!: Wow. This book is hilarious!Characters were believable. I felt as if they were people I knew.Storyline was intriguing. Loved the whole betting aspect of their relationship.I read it in one sitting because I couldn't force myself to put it down.Found myself laughing out loud and wearing a stupid grin for most of the book.What a fun read this was.It's one I would read again and again.
0, LAME!: Sorry

0, Cute story
0, Very Very Disappointed: I am such a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie
1, Wonderful funny read: This was a terrific story that had me laughing all through it. The characters really grow on you and the plot has plenty of twists and new developments. This is my first Jennifer Cruise novel
1, New York Slick is just that: Great album
1, losing control: One of Kira Reed's best. In case you don't know
0, Ye gods: The worst record I have heard this year. The guy I bought it from sold it because he couldn't stand it. Even the Princeton Record Exchange won't take it.It's not even well-recorded. Or interesting ... even though it seems like it should be
0, Bad. So Very Bad.: This movie has awesome cover art. That is about it. The catering on the set may have been good too(unconfirmed) but nothing in the film was good. The story was weak. The actors were weak. They tried to make the main character look just like Brandon Lee in The Crow. The background music songs were cheesy knock-offs meant to sound like popular songs. For the most part I laughed at it. Bad. So very bad.
0, Yikes! I should have read reviews: Because this is an Apple product
0, Apple always the best (FOR MAKING MONEY): Just as other customers already said
0, Love the scroll ball
0, A real bummer: I'm a big mac user
1, Great mouse for OS X: It took about a year but it finally gave me carpal tunnel syndrome in both arms and hands. The exposé feature is really bad for that problem. I moved back to aLogitech Optical Marble Mouse (USB/PS2)I once used for a while after buying aLogitech Trackman Wheel Opticalwhich didn't help. But after a few months using that trackball
1, box set dvd: this order was very well packaged
0, Doesn't meet the reputation: The wimpy treatment of Jesus in this movie is disgusting and misleading. The treating him as a slacker and a dreamer borders on slanderous. Heston's acting is wooden
0, It sucks: I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD. So
1, GREAT MOVIE!!!: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE AND NOW I HAVE IT FOR MY COLLECTION!!!! A DEFINTIE FOR ANY DVD COLLECTION-EXCELLENT STORY!!!
1, Classic!: Great old classic
1," An Excellent Epic: This movie is truly legendary. What I can't stand is people criticizing it for copying other films. Can anyone explain how Ben hur could have ""stolen"" from Smokey and the Bandit when Smokey and the Bandit was made nearly 20 YEARS after Ben Hur? If you are going to criticize a movie"
1, Essential edition: Well
1," The Greatest Hollywood Epic since ""Gone with the Wind"": William Wyer's epic masterpiece is now in a four disc DVD set with bonus features as exciting as a chariot race"
1, One of the greatest films of all time.: Charlton Heston gives his best performance of his long distinguished career as the Jew Judah Ben-Hur who stood up to the might of the Roman army and became a legend . Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are excellent as the boy hood friends turned foes.Oh yeah
1, First time Anais Nin Reader: Delta of Venus By Anais NinExcellent Erotica. This is the first time I have read her work. Will read more.
0, wont buy without listening sample!: the description is interesting
1, Angelic music: If you like uplifting
0, not rock and roll: I bought this album when i was converting from tape to cd and could not find This Means War
1, Awesome: I love this movie...its so classic
1, Classic Chinese Folklore: Anyone and everyone in America has grown up on the fairtales of Europe. This is one the best movies out there about a classic chinese tale of swords and sorcery of horror and love. As the title suggest. I can't really find the words to explain it but this movies rates up there with Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2. Its that good.
1, WATCH VIDEO WITH AN OPEN MIND: I just finished watching this video and I have to say wow this truly blew me away. Great collaborations
1, GO OUT AND BUY......NOW: The best live album from the pulse. Extremely tight sound and reminds you of steel pulse at their very best. I kept playing this CD over and over again
1, Great Purchase!: This book is full of fun activities that can be used in my classroom. I would recommend this book to any Language Arts teacher!
1, A great book for all ages to appreciate!: This book combines humor and wit with lessons appropriate for all ages. The author is able to paint a clear picture of the joys of being friends with people who are different. The illustrations are fabulous
0, a very shallow character: I enjoyed the reminders of the fifties but I couldn't get past her shallowness. When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it.
1, Red Sox Version of Moneyball...Great Book!!!: If you're a Sox fan
0, It's junk don't buy it: It's hard to cock
1, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic: Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic is about an old widow named Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle who has cures for everything! For example: The Interrupters Cure
0, One of the worst films ever made?: What alternate universe did the makers of this film come from? It doesn't even deliver on the ick factor like Ilsa She Wolf of the S.S. did. It's just plain embarrassing.
1," Their best CD no doubt: I didn't care to much for their music after ""Core"" and ""Purple""... or so I thought. I just knew what I heard on the radio. I bought ""Thank you"" just to see and then I bought this one. ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" was so good that I had to go back and get ""Tiny Music From The Vatican Gift Shop"
0, STP goes Pop...: What a mistake it was to buy this CD. This is one of those CD's that has 1 or 2 good songs on it. I was expecting the usual STP hard rock that made them famous
0," They coulda' aspired to be so much better..........: ... However...I anxiously awaited ""Shangri"""
0, This is why you shouldn't marry and have 2 kids: SW
0, STP goes out with a whimper: Possibly the last album from Stone Temple Pilots
1, can't wait for their next album: In 1994 I bougt their single Plush. Vasoline was the next one.In 1996 I heard Trippin on a hole in a paper heart. That song was in my head for years. Last year I bought Tiny Music for thatsong. A great album with no bad song on it. No 4
1, BAD TIMES FOR MUSIC!: I just listened to Shangri La Dee Da and
0, Maybe Dave Coutts wants his old job back!!: Tool is the best band nowadays
1, Great insight into one of the best selling album of all time: This is a great DVD from the classic albums line. the DVD is split into 2 sections part 1 is 50 minutes (?) It goes into great detail how the band put this album together. The interviews were excellent and Steve Clark finally gets the recognition he so finely deserves (and has done for years). I think they should have had more than a 30 second interview soundbyte from Steve though. This dvd also features promo videos for different songs both live and through music video. In closing on section 1 I thought this album had the band at breaking point though it was very draining on all on them to get the results that they got.The second part about 50/51 minutes Joe and Phil take you almost track for track telling you how each song was put together. Joe and Phil also perform unplugged versions of songs from Hysteria. Overall this was a very DVD I got mine for... and I thought it was wellworth shelling out for in the end.
1, I bought the cd on a whim and gut instinct...: and I don't regret buying it. It's an overall fantastic cd. I was trying to think of who her voice resembles. I'm reading a lot of Janis Joplin
0, Misleading: I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed. It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source. So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi. If you have only optical audio to take care of
0, A poor book overall.: Flashes of what could have been a great story
0, Horrid
1, Great Movie from a Beautiful City: I really enjoyed this film and I do not generally enjoy subtitled movies. The characters were believable and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Mehmet and Francesco slowly develop into a physical and emotional bond. The only reason I did not give this film a 5-star rating is because I disliked the ending. I felt that it's message was one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life and that it has no serious future. This is simply untrue. There was no need to make the wife into the type of character she became. Great scenery and a rich introduction into Turkish culture and family life.
0, Pointless movie!: This movie is pointless. It's not erotic. It's not poetic. It's not passionate. It's not dimensional. It's not dramatic. It's just plain boring
0, Buy a Different Edition: This edition was scanned from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost down
1, An Irresistible Winning Comedy! Halarious!: This movie si really funny and one of the best of 1997
1, I loved it!!!!!!!: I took my husband to see this at the theatre and didn't tell him what it was about. It was one of the nicest afternoons that we have spent together in years. Even my 75 year old mother enjoyed it. My son just bought me the sound track for Mothers day!
1," Different and great....: This movie is "" different "" and great as achange of pace from the standard farethat is available. Watch this movie andbe totally engaged in a new experience--and have a great time to boot.Highly entertaining and I do recommend itto anyone seeking a good time movie."
0, A test of credibility: THE FULL MONTY is a movie buff's test of credibility. It doesn't have the suspense to carry on as a drama. If it is a comedy
1, A classic!: Must read. If you like poetry
1, excellent book: We love this book so far and it came very promptly after ordering. My son likes this year's literature much better because of the stories covered in this publication.Thanks! We'll order again from you!
1, Soulfull and Gorgeous Writing: I don't know where to begin with my praise and appreciation of this book. Right off the bat I loved the atmosphere
1, Any Gardener's Must-Have Book: I have other gardening books
0, Terrible toffee: The toffee tasted like butterfinger bars... ok...if that is what one thinks toffee should taste like.. Very underwhelming.Dissapointed and will not buy this brand again
1, A writer's book: This is a book about becoming real in a world of unreal people. Not many of London's regular fans liked this book
0, Not famous for good reasons.: Three chapters on doing laundry. 30 chapters on trying to get a story published. Stupid ending. Not worth the while.
0, Broke.... After I broke it with a hammer!: What is she thinking
0, Oh Please!: First of all
0, My God! where is the creativity?: Wow... as I express
0, What a disssapointment: Wow I waited all this time for THIS - what was he smoking. Is this the new trend to try to be like Outkast and mix bad rock with hip hop.Come on Mos you can do better. This album is unlistenable and it almost pains me especially when I compare it to the first.3 out of 19 songs are just OKThe Easy SpellChampion RequiemLife is RealIt's too bad. He is going to have to come again in order to claim back his respect.The mystique is no longer
0, WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!: I REALLY LOVE MOS
1, The Unthinking Brilliance Of A Casual Genuis: Most people will be put off by Mos Def's new album on the basis that it's different from the norm and what they are used to listening. I have read reviews treating it as Hip-hop and reviews treating it as rock. I've yet to read one that views it as I do as an eclectic amalgamation of all forms of music that are dear to the artist. This album is Mos's own; it's selfishly his own. Yet some of the tracks appear to be put together so casually that it is all you can do to listen and revel in the sheer brilliance of such haphazard beauty. I would Mos Def recommend this to all lovers of music
0, New Danger should have been danger.: Mos Def has produced great albums
0, Horrible...: When I heard that Mos Def was coming out with a new album
0, Garbage
0, ehh
1, A Master Statesman/Politician: A well documented video on the life of Britain's finest statesman/politician
1, Lost Potential in Spy Drama...: A young mathematical genius
1, Flawed but very intelligent WWII thriller: Enjoyable
1, A great find: I stumbled upon this album and immediately fell in love. The songs resonate in memory; the emotions expressed are universal experiences; the feeling way they're presented is unique. Nick Reifsteck has a rich baritone that has the same quality the great Ian Tyson possesses
0, the shadow of her smell: ok
1, One of my favorite love stories: I was able to see this movie in high definition ON DEMAND USING XFINITY/COMCAST. The picture quality was equal to a Blu ray
0, Not One For Wedding Processions: Adult literary techniques do not always translate well to children's books. Although there is some interesting insight into the lives of children that shows through this book
0, Another Disappointment: At this point I am undecided about this whole series. Once I get over the poor writing style
1, Love Kenyon's books !: I recommend her books highly. She also writes as Kinley MacGregor
1, Finally a plan of action...: I read a few other books
1, Piano trio at its finest: My favourite type of jazz is the piano trio. And the Roberta Piket trio is fabulous. I picked up this cd in a store
1, Without question
0, Very disappointing: I've never read Michael Stackpole and was pretty happy with the first book in this series..couldn't wait until the second one came out. Of course
0, FALLIN' FOR SAW PRODUCTION: It didn't work for Kylie Minogue
0, Worthless!: This book is 50% old exams (old
1, My husband's Fav Shorts: Finding these cotton thin mens' shorts are difficult - they are the only ones my husband will wear. Their year-round cotton comfort and roomy legs and waist is what he wants. He likes the pockets and the drawstring waist too.
0, Not true to size: I ordered these shorts to replace my husband's old pair of Russell shorts. Although I ordered the same size
0, Terrible Sizing: The sizing of these shorts is a joke. Read all the reviews very carefully before buying - something has changed within the last couple years.
0, Not 100% Cotton: I have been looking for some cotton shorts that look good on me and these are not them. The crotch area is way too long. Most important
1," Got what i needed!: Pretty much got what I was looking for. It fit my dinosaur of a band saw and the shipping was quick and cheap. 62"" blades are extremely hard to find but amazon pointed me to the right one."
1, A beautiful voice and spirit
1, Wonderful CD.: I have never purchased a Jewel CD before and this was a excellent start. I thought she has an angelic voice and I plan on buying more CDs of hers.
1, What a pleasant Christmas CD!!!: I was always a quasi-fan of Jewel
0, Merry Jewel: This is the closest thing to mainstream folk Christmas album anyone will get. Although there are backing vocals and an orchestra thrown in for extra holiday glee
1, Jewel has an awesome voice: Jewel's christmas collection is awesome
0, Pass on the '06; you'll need the '07 by the time it arrives: I ordered this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the 16th of December
1, good headphones: I use these headphones with my clix 2 and not many complaints here. The cord is kind of long but I can deal with it. Decent sound. The only caution that I give is to avoid turning on the headphones while wearing them and music is playing. Also
0, not bad
0, ear piece broke after one year use: It worked great for about a year
1, Great Value for the Money: I just wore these on a trip to China. Worked awesome on the airplane drowning out cabin noise. Made the trip much better. I was able to hear the movie much better than with my other ear buds. I have not tried the more expensive Bose units
1, Best Book Ever: Have you ever heard of the Redwall books?. I would highly recommend this book to people whom like fantasy
1, Michael Whatley's review for Mossflower: This book is an excellent thriller with mystery and non-stop adventure on every page. You just can't stop reading this novel of a lifetime.
1, An adventurous aminal tale.: If you like action
1," ""Amazing"
1, This was a gift: This was a gift for my husband to replace a casette tape he had for many years. He wanted it in the CD version. He was pleased to be able to find it.
0, Looks great but wont fit BMW keyfob: Well isnt the #1 job of a BMW key chain to fit a BMW keyfob? The slot in the keyfob is too small to insert the ring into it. You have to get a second smaller ring and attach that to to the keychain ring. Otherwise the keychain looks nice and is made with quality.
1, An alternative to Wheelock: I have finished Wheelock and its workbook. I am now using Learn to Read latin and its workbook to both take a different perspective and consolidate my effort to read Latin after a seventy year hiatus. Learn to Read latin serves that purpose. Very good selections unaltered from the original.
1, Great movie: I always rent from amazon always great qualityNever any streaming issues. Great prices I use amazon strictly I no longer use other rental options
1, OEM
1," Like Being in a Popcorn Popper!: I first heard Jonathan Richman in the movie ""There's Something About Mary"" but at the time I wasn't as interested in music and didn't seek him out for a better listen. Many many years later"
1, Greatest party album with mellow songs and dance songs: the disc gives you a feeling maybe that summer feeling because it will haunt one day in your life. Just like this cd does if your into fun and entertaining music by a musician that you can actually understand this disc is for you. Roomin' house rocks i've seen some cover bands do the number i would love to see jonathan live one of these days pick up this one.
0, Doesn't Hit The Mark: I have seen quite a few productions of COMPANY including the original on Broadway. Unfortunately
1, Company: Excellent production values characterize this latest Sondheim CD. Vocals and instrumentals came through with remarkable clarity so that the words could be understood and none of the Sondheim wit was lost.
1, Definitely a great album to chill and read by the fire.: If you love piano and hearing a maestro exhibit amazing talent and passion
0," WARNING: Product Rip-off !: WARNING! The bridge assembly shipped is nothing like the photo. It is much cheaper in construction. The package is branded as ""Kluson"":- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT contained within the body of the steel bridge (as shown in photo)"
1, Liberalism: A Spiritual Cancer: Most books on controversial subject matter embody a certain element of overkill to prove their point but Michael Rose is 'shockingly on the mark' with
0, Take Another Look Please: This author doesn't explore the real issue of what the church considers valuable
1, IT IS WHAT IT IS: This film footage was filmed in low light conditions (stage lighting conditions only)
1," The Viking!: This is the best NHOP cd I have ever heard! Most of the songs are traditional Danish ""Folk songs"""
0, Pathetically Awful: The original serious was pretty good. This 1999 movie was so painfully bad that it looks like it was the last thing the writer
0, Loud
1," Inspired and Brilliant: I didn't love this as much as I loved ""Mere Christianity"" but I did really enjoy the amazing insights of C.S. Lewis into human nature"
1, Understanding the enemy: This book was an awesome read and really opened my eyes to how the devils operate within a Christian mans mind. Beautifully written
1, I loved reading this
1, a must read: a must read
0, Not for learning Thai: I have to say if I were Thai and wanted to learn english
1, Amazing: I bought this CD for my husband
0, I didn't enjoy reading Frugal Families.: I love Jonni McCoy's first book
1, Lots of tips: Great book on frugal living. However

1, Great food..: I am a long time fan of Mr. Slater and have purchased three of his books
1," a classic jefferson starship cd: if you are a true jefferson starship fan you must add this classic cd to your collection. the cd is chock-full of the beautiful ballads and hard-rocking masterpieces that made the starship one of the best bands of the 70's/80's. do not pass this up. this has been a hard to find gem and we can thank amazon.com for un-""earth""-ing this jewel."
1," This book is a must read for anyone visiting Louisiana.: I was able to use the information to customize an entire 1 week vacation for my family. If you like ""out of the way"" places and ""different"" things to see and do"
1, Tragic and Touching Story: This movie is great for someone who prefers a certain European twist to their films. The characters do an excellent job in portraying life as it was in the time period. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci carry the movie along well until the resolution. The end is so abrupt and in a sense leaves the viewer hanging. Aside from the sad ending
0, avant-garde failure: i personally find johnny depp and christina ricci to be not only excellent actors
0, SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE!!!!!!!: GREAT CAST / HORRIBLE SCRIPT / LAUGHABLE PERFORMACES / A WASTE OF TIME 
1, Great stuff!: I remember this album (remember those???) from the early 80s -- a roommate of mine at camp brought a tape and introduced me to it. That was it -- I was hooked on these English chicks! Surprisingly
0, Could have been better: While the book had the potential to be very interesting
0, Come on please.........: I hear so much fuzz comparing their music to the Beatles. Do yourself a favor and dont ever repeat this. Im sorry to say this group doesnt even get near to PFR in quality of music. This cd is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1, Flawless is flawless: This is a clever
1, great movie: It's a great!The only problem is no English subtitle on film.Cause I am a customer of oversea. So it is a little bit diffcult for understand what the story of film.
1, Gift: This was a gift to our son. He was thrilled to receive it and will continue to enjoy it for many years to come. He is a wood worker and is interested in all sorts of books about wood working and wood workers.
1, A good look into the insights of interface design.: 'The Humane Interface' was a very good book. I particularly enjoyed the discussion about the metrics used to quantify the efficiency of a given interface based on its information content. Important stuff.That portion of the book should be required reading for anyone designing an interface.
0, Don't believe the hype!: As a mechanical engineer
0, Disappointing and frustrating: There are many whiz-bang features that sound impressive but are of limited use in my experience.The basic functionality of this program is impaired. The user interface in not that intuitive
0, do not buy this if you have a new system
0, A Deflating Turn of Events: What began as an interesting novel and journeyed into an interesting form of describing humanity and some of our worst shortcomings
0, Unable to use: I was not even able to use this product as the instructions were not very clear on how to install. There were conflicting instructions within the instructions themselves.
0, Disappointing: We had the older model of this showerhead so figured the new one would be even better. We have been disappointed in it because like others have said
1," The Search For A Flexible Showerhead Is Over!: When you're 5'2"" and your husband is 6'1"""
1, Couldn't live without it!: I have had a water-pik shower head since they were first developed and only came in white. The only thing about them is if you bend the goose-neck too much and too many times
1, Flexible Shower Head: We had trouble finding this type of shower head in Hardware Stores. Our previous one
0, cheap and leaky: leaks at the joint real bad...also the dial part is cheap - and feels frail - water pressure not very good...a total waste of my money.
1, Great for tall people: I have had a shower head like this in the past so when it came time to replace the old handheld one we had
0, Higher price and lower quality: Have spent hours looking for this item
0, White Boys do Steel Band??: I didn't care much for this CD. As my title indicates
0, basically
1," Best album of ""the poets"": The canadian poets have offered to us their best album ""up to here"" with their all time classic ""New Orleans is sinking"""
0, There Are Much Much Better Books Out There For Dumbbells: This book is extremely basic. If you want to get into lifting dumbbells you will end up buying Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness by Matt Brzycki and Fred Fornicola and Men's Health Ultimate Dumbbell Guide. Those book are great for starting up and improving. This book was of no use to me since I also bought the above mention books.
1, Great Collection: I thought this cd was a great collection of movie themes played on the grand piano. It sounds wonderful!
1, His Third Best !!!!!: Owning this LP since 1975 and last listening to it about 10 years ago. This is Mangione at his top three best. Behind Children of Sanchez and Tarantella LPs and in front of Live at the Hollywood Bowl. This is a must buy for anyone who likes Mangione. Recorded live at Massey Hall in Toronto with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra and Ester Satterfield on vocals. The quartet
1, Useful tail bag for day trips: I like the look of the Iron Rider series of bags
1, You Must View this Film!: I teach sixth graders. We spend time learning about the Holocaust from our WWII unit in our SS book
1, Must read!: This is the best thriller I've read in a long time. The suspense and the triumph over evil make it an exciting read
0, Sent the wrong part: The company sent me the wrong part. Because they are not part of Amazon
1, Powerbook G4 replacement battery not bad.: Fits great like the original and looks identical but battery life is probably 90% of the original. Can't beat it for the price though. I recommend it.
0, not so hotsie: This screenplay shows the authors have writing talent
1, Night Play (Dark Hunter
1," This is why I read paranormal romance !: Great book. I have all the Kenyons books. They take me away from the everyday and are much better for you than that pint of chocolate ice cream. This one is more of the same....perfect. I loved the brooding hero and it was nice to see a plus size character. And for the reviewer who felt a size 18 was obese....it's amazing how Mae West managed to look so good with her obese body. And I just know Marilyn Monroe at size 16 must have disgusted us all. Please re-evaluate your concept of ""obese"" ."
1, Sweet movie: This movie is a family favorite. We love Gary Sinese in any case
1, An amazing chronicle: I don't usually go to superlative praise
1, not Return to Lonesome Dove but entertaining: I prefer Return to Lonesome Dove over Streets. Some think McMurtry tried to hard to distance this from Return and messed things up for the fans. I wont argue. I do like the production
0, Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove.: If you read my other reviews you will see I am one of the biggest fans of Lonesome Dove and even Return to Lonesome Dove. But Streets of Laredo is nothing like Lonesome Dove except for the names. Call a bounty hunter give me a break. But what is even crazier than that is Lorena married to Pea Eye. I think Larry made this so far out there to get back at Hollywood for their movie. What he didn't realize was he was hurting the fans who loved Lonesome Dove so much with this stupid ending. Any true fan of Larry's Lonesome Dove has to know this was not the way he had envisioned this to end when he wrote Lonesome Dove. Very disappointed in Larry's ending
0, Don't Let the Smooth Taste Fool You&#65533;: It just sounds like the Stone Roses. Vocally
0, Men couldn't get away with that...: The book's title says it all - I'm the victim
0, ridiculous: I usually enjoy psychology-related books
1, The waterpik trs-559: The waterpik trs-559 has two water filters inside the attachment to your water line. One is white and the other is black. The manual says you can choose not to install the white one
1, Great for the price!: Our shower head on our double headed unit broke so we bought this item as a replacement. It was super easy to hook up as a replacement to the original and works great! Love the pulsing option
0, Disappointment: This hand-held shower head doesn't have the usual force associated with a shower. The massage is weak and not at all invigorating. I am not happy with this purchase.
1, Very nice!: Easy install
1, Very Impressed: For this price
0, Adequate
1, SIMPLY THE BEST: Waterpik TRS-559 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower
1, A sense of assurance: A friend gave me this book as a gift
0, Not a great movie
0, Poor Quality: I took my family's advice to go and shop on Amazon.com for the things I need everyday and am very disappointed. The shade is of cheaper material than dollar store napkins and half the size of my compact car's windshield. I will never buy from this buyer again.
0, Ghost: I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem
1, Soppy but good movie!: I have seen this movie many times over the years and I still enjoy it. I miss Swayze. Whoopie made me laugh out loud.
1, THIS MOVIE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!: I was one of those people who did not run to see this movie in theaters and waited many years to see it on video. I watched it again recently in my home theater and it holds up amazingly well. It has elements of romance
1," "" Ditto "": Phenominally successful film"
0, Barely a Mention of Slavery!: How can a professor write a book about the Revolutionary War in South Carolina and not talk about slavery in some detail?....very bizarre.stay away and beware anyone who recommends this book..which at times feels like just a chronological list of battles over a 24 month period in South Carolina.
0, About the condition of this item.......: I bought this movie for my daughter who had one when she was younger and it has somehow disappeared. She loves the story
0, Product is fine but the service stinks: I ordered one of these for each of my 2 cars. The one for the Town Car is great
1, Thought it was easy.: I worked with it without reading any directions
0, Pale copy: Yeah this is a pretty bad album!I liked it when it came out but unlike Queen's albums this one got old pretty fast.It sounds a lot like THE WORKS queen's period-not the greatest either but...-without the magic and the inspiration.THE CROSS is a good rock and roll band and ROGER TAYLOR a great singer and composer but this album doesn't reflect any of those qualities unlike Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know and Blue Rock (2nd and third CROSS albums)Which are real cool energetic rock and not a pale copy of Queen.
0, Handle slides off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Used this for about 15 minutes before I noticed the black rubber handle sliding off the fiberglass shaft. Had to constantly smack it back into place just to get the job done. Returning item.
1, Superb!: If you want to have an instant website without wasting a lot of time
0," Plagiate: This book is a plagiate of Mika Waltari's book ""The Roman"" (original titel ""Ihmiskunnan viholiset"""
0, Great for reference
0, Mislabeled--this is a cat toy: While this is a nice toy
0, wrong product: Product was the wrong adapter - could not get reimbursement - or rather get a return code to this date - very difficult to deal with the company - still no results in refunding.
1, Grease is the word.: I wanted to see Grease because I was in love with Olivia Newton-John. I watched it at a friend's house and loved it all the way through. Great music and great scenes all the way through. Who could forget the race at Thunder Road and the dance off? Of course
0, Not what was promised: Original Review:I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised. After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up. Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.I guess what you see isn't always what you get. I'm sure the actual movie is fine. I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches. Maybe I should check that
0, Dopey movie
0, DVD: The response was great and the shipping was great but the DVD was not in good shape. It fades in and out and is difficult to watch. But all and all it was ok.
1, Grease the Movie: Christmas present for my daughter. She will love it. Looks great
1, All movie preservation fans
1, screen vs. stage: I really do like this movie. I've seen it several times and the 5.1 stereo sound is more than wonderful. The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But
1, happy: The item came in plenty of time for christmas. very happy with the product. looks great works great. Awesome. Thanks
1, Shows the real deal: I like this movie because it portrays the true politics that went down when deciding who would break the color barrier in the major leagues. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jackie Robinson as a play and as a man
1, Second of two classic Christmas albums: Buck recorded two Christmas albums back in the sixties. While I agree with most people that the first
0, Limited: It is too small. It will barely accommodate a Chardonnay bottle
0, a disappointment: Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture. leftovers from various artists all put in the same album. No coherence at all. Big band
1, rubbish: 4 GB is amazing and although mine did not work
1, I like it: I just bought this a few days ago. Everything is fine
0, Save your money: Save your money and buy an IPOD. This product doesn't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with. I sold mine on ebay.
1, Small Player
0, okay at first...: So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it. It's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu (much better than a sansa or an iPod)
0, This is a really awkward peeler: It is very uncomfortable.Too thick to hold
1, Swivel Peeler: I used this peeler on some apples and found it to be the best one that I have ever used! It made preparing apples for applesauce and apple pies and crisps so much easier and faster.
1, I love this peeler: I owned another OXO peeler for about 10 years
0, Frustrating
0, bulky: The blade is good but the huge handle makes it hard to use. Someone with small hands would find this very unweildy. I bought this to replace an old peeler of similar design but with just a simple metal handle. I shall be going back to using that.
1, Cuts time in the kitchen: This peeler makes fast work of carrots and potatoes. I make a lot of carrot juice and was looking for a peeler that would cut my time down in the kitchen. This peeler fit the bill. Definitely a good bargain and easy to use.
1, A TRULY UNIQUE AND MEMORIBLE BOOK!!!: The Enchanted Castle was a great book with delightful characters that act out a memorible tale of magic

1, Worthy of the Ender series: Was closer to the Enders Game
0, Missing something: Never realized how much the The Real Wolrd benefits from having the hit songs of that time showcased in it. All those cheesy songs from the early 90's have been taken out of this edition
0, NO MUSIC???: I was about to purchase this DVD until I was informed that the original background music was taken out and replaced with something entirely different. Why?!? The first season DVD should have the original early 90's music
0, Who's idea was it to replace the original music?: I am interested in the Real World San Francisco (season 3) but when I watch it on the MTV website
0, marie Claire Idees: I ordered this magazine and never recieved a single issue. I never got a response from my complaint.
0, Coastline and Inland...: I bought this CD hoping for peaceful shoreline sounds my infant could sleep to but was disappointed because after 20 minutes you don't hear the ocean at all; instead
0, not in English: Not really a review
1, Nice
0, Does not work with blackberry 2.5 mm interface: After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter
0," Worse than a ""b"" movie: Not worth the time and trouble. Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter. Try Angel Blue for something in this same vein that is really a good movie."
0, My donkey could make a better airsoft gun: If you ever encounter this gun dont buy it go out to eat or save the money for something better I'm beggin you. Its not durable the scope is a plastic tube and the laser donsen't line up dont buy it
1, Velvet Underground: This is the most underrated of all the velvet underground's albums and it just might be the best. Yes
0, I would not buy from them again: I received Michael Kors Eau De Parfum 3.4 oz. It was wrapped in the box and looked new. However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it. Obviously it was tampered with- now I don't know what I'm spraying on myself. I will never buy from them again.
1, Well worth it!: When I first considered this product
1, Gets the job done: This works as good as any corer should. You don't have to push down to hard to get the result you want. The hole is wide enough to get everything out. Great product.
1, Apple Corer: I bought this apple corer so I could core my apples more easily than with a knife. It works as advertised so I'm happy! :)
1," THIS ALBUM IS A COUNTRY CLASSIC!: Martina McBride's ""The Time Has Come"" is the best debut album ever. It is country in its purest forms. ""The Time Has Come"" is filled with awesome lyrics. My favorite tracks are: ""The Time Has Come"
0, Many problems: I've owned this watch (the black one) for about a year now. I did not purchase the foot pod accessory.The watch has on 4 occaisions gone 'all black' lighting up every pixel on the face. When this happens you have to do a 'reboot' holding all 4 buttons down simultaneously until the watch resets. Of course all your data needs to be reentered.THe watch has also mysteriously reset to March 24
0, Very cheap product: I have owned older Polar hear rate monitors
1, groovy
1, Recommended: While there were some rants that I didn't agree with
0, Disappointing: We have only the paring knife from this set
0, Did Not Work: I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark
0," THE ""GRESH"" who stole christmas: Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible. Gresh has no imagination in trying to figure out how future science may explain a superhero.If Gresh lived in the past"
0," GET THE ORIGINAL HARRY POTTER SCORE!!!! ~NOT THIS!!!!~: I have had ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"" original soundtracks for a very long while. And when I was at the store one day I spotted this soundtrack... it looked different from the others I had"
0, A great bit part for Jackie Chan
0, Yuck: Tiny Tim was in my opinion a very talented individual but his talent seems sorely lacking in this rather sad collection of Christmas songs. The less serious songs are fun and entertaining but the more traditional songs are about as enjoyable as a root canal without painkillers.If you want a Tiny Tim album get one of his better efforts such as Girl or the import God Bless Tiny Tim.
1, Thanks For The Memories: I used to watch I Spy when I was a kid and loved it. I sort of figured seeing it again after all of these years that it would be disapointing but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the show held up. Now
0, Doesn't Quite Cut the Mustard: The story is a fun one...It's quick and easy for parents to read to their child before bedtime. The illustrations are fun and keep the child interested. But
1, Great fun book!: I bought this book for my daughter in preschool and she loved it. My 6 year old grandson who has been held back in kindergarden read this book over Thanksgiving vacation with us that I gave him this book to take back home. He has read this book over and over to anyone who wants to listen to the story more than 10 times. This book has open the door to reading. This Christmas he is getting other David Shannon's books. I want to thank this book in helping to open the door to reading. My grandson who had no interest in words
1, Great product for the price: Easy installation and works great. The only thing that stops me from giving a 5 star rating is the base being square doesn't match the odd shpe of the base of my TV.
1, Favorite <3: This is definitely one of those books that I would pick up and read at least once a year because it has the perfect mix of innocence and idealism. I've read this over 10 times and it still makes me go puppy eyed when my favorite couple are together~ Hands down
1, Anne of the Island: This third book of the series (Anne of Green Gables) is as good as the first and better than the second.
0, There was no Augustus Pelltier!: Creating historical fiction is a fine art. Where history is known
0, Not too tempting to play again: The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song
0, Needs a new singer: I gave this a 2 star rating because Sharon den Adel can not sing. This would be a perfect band if they found a new singer
1, Comfortable and stylish!: For the price
1, Form your own opinion: this is my first time seeing this movie and I was blown away by the performances. Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor
1, Best gloves you'll ever buy: these are the third pair of gel proframers ive bought. i am rough with my hands at work and have gone through other gloves in weeks
0, A Waste of Time: The best thing I can say about this title is that it is better than nothing. These contracts are short and lacking in any real substance. Moreover
0, does not work for phone calls: The microphone howls as soon as the phone connects to thenetwork. Works great for games or radio.
1, Where did I miss this one?: I'm not sure how this work passed by me. Four classic Kingtales with numerous Dark Tower allusions
0, Movie Mickey Blue Eyes DVD: Bought this movie because I like it
0, Waste of Popcorn: I saw this movie at the cinema. Having enjoyed other Hugh Grant flicks
0," ABC ? It must stands for ""A very Bad book on C !"": Contrary to what the title of this book implies"
1, Get Read Great Information: This is a great book that you cannot put down. The author does an amazing job telling the story of Isadora's life and giving the picture of the importance of her work in its historical context. I learned so much about her life
0, Don't waste your money: I just bought 4 guitar christmas albums. I almost threw this out the window. Pure garbage. Do not waste your money on this.
1, Awesome!: This book is awesome! Although I have to admit
1, I found myself when I read this book.: This insightful
0, The worst audiobook ever: We have listened to dozens of audiobooks and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but the stacatto
0, Self-Serving: Reading the book was slow and painful. I'm sure Arthur is a very nice man and honest
0, Too Little Too Late: First of all
0, A Sleep Aid: First
1, Drifting Away: The drifting music ofLaura (Fox Film Noir)melts us into the portrait of a murdered beauty. We are infatuated. Vincent price walks into the scene and all we see is his usual handsome
1, Lovely Laura!: My daughter Laura suggested I try to locate a copy of this old film
1, Fantastic Film! Fantastic Seller!: This is a favorite of mine. I think most people would agree. The Amazon seller represented the product accurately. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.
1, By far
1, The Legend of 1900: The Legend of 1900This is an Amazing movie! Fantastic music
1, Recieved in time Great movie: Love the Movie great story line good music kind of historical in a way back to the early part of the 20th Century

0," ""Dude"
0, Release the Director's Cut: With Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin behind the wheel
0, Absolute junk!: Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much
0, Okay but not cigar: First off I want to say that this movie was not all that it was hped up to be. My family has been involved in the racing business for many years now and this movie just stinks. The FXs are okay
0, I watched this on a recommendation ......: Somebody recommended this wonderful piece of tripe to me as a good movie
1, Feel the wind.: A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top.A race scene is very exciting. Especially
0, Stallone is Provolone -- CHEEZE -- BAD FOR THE SPORT: I have never been witness or had to sit through a more painful 88 minutes. I'm a racing fan
0, Racing for Soap Opera fans: I did not like this movie at all. I thought that I might like it when I saw the previews. It was like a bad soap opera combined with a music video.
0," It's not ""Rocky"": Sly Stallone wrote this script"
0, ok movie
0," Drivel: I totally disagree with the opening statement that all racing movies are ""clunkers""....despite their faults"
1, Easy to grip
0, FOR COLLECTORS ONLY: This 1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others. Fortunately Bennie and Charlie Rouse returned to the studio several years later and recorded BACK ON THE SCENE for Blue Note. It is much the better of the two and is included in the 3 CD box set which gives you 5 LPs worth of music
0, Fogless? Not quite: The mirror was in fact fogless for about 6 months
0, just the pointed ends...: the tongs where hard to grip..so what I did to avoid sending them back.I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward..like a claw. Now they are excellent.grip great. love the long handle...and heavy duty soft rubber.hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back.
0, This Movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO overrated!!!!!!!!!!: This movie is SOOOOOOOOOO bad! By far
0, Dolby Digital or DTS?: My receiver and DVD player are capable of both Dolby Digital Decoding and DTS. I want to find out which Jaws DVD to purchase
1, Jaws (The best film of our time): This is the best film of this generation
1, Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition): The movie was in excellent condition and I received it very quickly (just a few days after my order was placed).
1, My fav movie: This is my favorite movie because it's a shark eating people... this movie is scary enough to keep you out of the ocean. If you watch this on a BIG BIG BIG screen TV
1, One of the best: Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time
1," Solid Peeler: I purchased this peeler because my flimsy Victorionox $3 peeler's blade snapped right off. I received recommendation of this peeler being ""the best peeler invented"" by a fellow chef. I was not disappointed at all"
0, A shame to kill so many innocent trees.: This book is flat out too long. The author's argument is simple. So simple
1, Have read for English 102: This isn't my first choice type of book
1, Good reference material: This book was great for what I wanted it for
0, Can anyone on the planet explain this CD???: Perhaps I am insane
1, The forgotten George Montgomery...at last!: Like many now past middle age
0, very light in content: The book is very light in content and written with a very narrow approach. If you want to learn anything about real estate don't buy this book.
0, Very disappointing product.: I thought buying OEM would be better than one of the clones. This battery isn't any better than the original battery that came with my phone 2 years ago. I don't use my phone much
1, SPANISH MADE EASY: After having formal Spanish in high school which was totally useless Spanish Step by Step was directed at people needing conversational spanish and not formal Spanish which noone speaks anyway. Great book for people needing to do a quick study for trips not to far in the future. Also for people needing to deal with Spanish speaking people in the job market or a business enviroment this book is a must!
0, Garbage: I also can't beleive Coleman would put out something like this. Blows cold air and now I will lose out on my shipping cost because I beleived in the Colman name and have to send back. It does nothing!! Well 
1, works great! but you need to read the directions...: Like the other users that have commented here
0," Piece of Trash: This book ""Doing Battle "
0, Broke in the first week: I bought this to help me open jars as I have tendonitis and have difficulty. While I was unsuccessfully trying to open a pickle jar
0, Doesn't open everything: I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed. It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble. The opening is way too big to accomplish that so
1, What a relief
0, oxo good grips jar poor product: I previous had a similar jar opener and have 2 places and wanted to keep one in one place and the other in another. This jar opener is an inferior product and the worse thing I ever purchased from Amazon(and I purchased numerous things)It doesn't grips all jars and it should have advised me of what it was made of.It looked various similar to the other one I own and I can't wait till I can find another jar opener like the other one so I can throw this one in the garbage.
0, The third dimension is NOT terror... its stupidity!: THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS. It's stupid
0, A bomb: I loved the first 2 Jaws films. As a child I saw this one also and it scared me
0, Not good at all...: This movie is so awful that you have to see it! The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws. Jaws 3 was way to long. The photography was so bad that you couldn't tall if someone was dead or alive. You had to guess. If you don't like blood
0," A Toothless Sequel: The nicest thing I can say about ""Jaws 3"" is that it makes me appreciate Spielberg's original 1975 classic even more. Everything about this movie is terrible"
0, Second Jaws sequel is dull but has some redeeming qualities.: The 2nd Jaws sequel is definetely not the worst
0, What a bunch of grapes!!!: First there was God
0, IT DOESN'T WORK: I ordered Jaws 3 and I could only play Jaws the original. I was ripped off!! Don't order this unless you want Jaws 1
0, Very
0," I'm amazed: Jaws 1 was a great movie....Jaws 2 still felt like a jaws movie because all of the original characters are there except for of course Quint and Hooper...But I am amazed at the ""good reviews"" this movie is getting!! The plot is silly ""MAMA IS MAD!!"" and the horrible special effects...a shark swimming backwards?? Throw this in the recycle bin and hit delete...this movie was embarrasing!!"
0, THE worst movie ever: I guess I have to give it a score! Terrible special effects and really bad acting.What were they thinking? A paper shark drawing by a 3-year old? Did the producers run out of money and couldn't come up with anything else?This movie is an insult to Spielberg who directed the original jaws.One star because I have to give something. Otherwise it will be -5 stars. Just terrible!
0, Worst Movie Ever Made: This was the worst movie ever created. I could have made better movies with crayons and glitter. Don't spend a dime buying this piece of garbage. I would rather watch paint dry than endure this swill. Thank God there is no Jaws 4.
0, Sucks Completly: Here is a perfect example of griding a story into the dirt. The acting and story line are so bad in this version
0, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: When this film came out I thought great. I always been an Arnold fan
1, First film Arnold Schwarzenegger did after his heart surgery.: Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This time he plays a man who must fight the devil and win before the clock strikes midnite and it becomes the Year 2000. Not a blockbuster
1, VERY good movie.: Okay...this had to be one of Arnold's best movies
0, TERRIBLE--RUN AWAY!: A complete waste of money
0, This movie was really bad...: Sorry
0, Worst Schwarzenegger Movie Since Last Action Hero: This movie started OK and then degenerated into a bunch of Action/Horror cliches Which left me fast forwarding to the end. By the end of this movie you don't care if the good guy's win
0, Dont buy
1, most disturbing thing i ever saw: this film is the most disturbing thing i've ever seen. satan being in something is just gonna lead to foulness but this just went a little 2 far. arnold needs 2 re-team with james cameron for true lies 2 or terminator 3.

0, Watch out for film deposits under the glass!: My six months old 4990 has a noticeable film deposits under the glass. The glass was clear when I bought it. Apparently other owners of the 4990 have had identicle problems (discussions at howtofixcomputers.com). Epson will clean it for free if the 4990 is still under warranty

1, good solid album: If you like rainbow then you should like this one. Good production good songs great guitar playing. Not the best rainbow album but worth buying.
1, It worked: I am not one who believes in these types of things but a friend convinced me to give it a shot. We needed to sell a house relatively fast because we were moving out of state. Our house was on market 3 days and we accepted an offer @ asking price. I tend to think it was setting the price right
0, Arrived in poor condition: I purchased the St. Joseph home sale kit for a friend who has been struggling to sell her house. It wasn't an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless. However
0, Didn't work: I got this silly plastic statue because I had heard it brought good luck in selling houses. I knew it was just a wives tale
1, This Fork is Good for a Dork: This cooking utensil is unlike any other. its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude. Little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well. say

1, Great Value: I bought this looking to replace another thunderstorm CD that was just too loud and startling. At the price
1, The first of a line of fantastic records by the Jam: The amazing thing about this record is its deceptive simplicity. It has all the halmarks of punk
1, This is where it all started!: Weller 18 a 60s obsessed mod teen takes speed sees the Pistols live and combines his love for soul and R&B with the fire of the who and the emerging punk scene. Is it a great record?- no but its a vital energetic youthful stab of music that would begin the career of the Uk's best songwriter youth icon. Plus there are some great tunes In the City Away from the numbers etc. This is a snapshot of London circa 1977 and though never punk Weller was the essential rebel and no one looked better and more determined than Paul. The Jam were to become the essential British rock band outside of the Clash and weller has gone on to this very day to be one of the best songwriters of our Generation. And better still the Jams legacy is untarnished and still sounds refreshing today!!!
0, This Product SUCKS!: I threw them out! the most cheaply made piece c..p I ever had. Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
0, Out of subject: This book concentrates on c++
0, Poorly written but I find the subject thought provoking: I have read 6 of the 8 in the series
1, Good Read: Just falls short of being called a classic

0, Lots of stains not listed: I was very disappointed with this book. I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I'm not very good with laundry. It turns out that every time I've referenced it

0, It's a shame: Poor Kirk Douglas ! His son Michael f## up any movie he plays in... And Sharon Stone is said to have the highest I.Q. in Hollywood. That is NOT proven at all by being in this lousy movie.May I remind you that Hollywood does not exist only since the 90s but back to the 40s 50s and 60s there are hundreds of MASTERPIECES you haven't even heard of -watch them and get smart instead of losing your time with violent artless movies
1, Underrated: Yes it is famous for the sex. But really
0, Very Poor Quality DVD Mastering: I doubt that Artisan even bothered to remaster this DVD release -- it looks like it was either 1) taken directly from the Laserdisc master or (and most likely) 2) taken from a general release print (not the original print) of the movie. What a shame -- Artisan usually produces some great DVD packages
0, Learn how to make your own reeds.: I played the bassoon in high school and purchased Jones reeds from a local music shop. 1 of 10 reeds I purchased were made properly. Not only did I spend a lot of money buying bad reeds

0, too expensive for what you get.: This product provides just 10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy
0, Not what I had in mind when i ordered it: The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted. I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks

1, gets the job done: before this i used another RCA cable - whenever my computer shifted even in the slightest
1, Creepily good: Since I tend to steer away from thrillers in general
0," Great Irony: My favorite thing about ""Murder by Numbers"" was the irony: The very thing the guilty boys were doing to mislead the police-red herring after red herring-was the very thing the producers/directors of the movie were doing to mislead the viewers into thinking they were watching a good movie."
0, Warmed-over TV thriller: Slightly more interesting than your average made-for-TV thriller playing on cable stations Saturday afternoons

1," Dillin's ""The Kentucky Rifle"" is Definitive: Originaly published in the '20's"
0, Way too slow and cheesy: I just recently watched this film and found it very boring and extremely fake. The acting was basically non-existent and it seems that every bloke in this film is only out to get into the lead ladies pants. The only appealing feature of this film was the nude scenes.
0, The missing piece: As a previous reviewer pointed out
0, Flat characters. Boring Story. Mediocre writing.: I'm not very demanding of my books. I just want a fun story with fun characters. This book failed to deliver either. The characters stuck to every stereotype. The actions and reactions were unbelievable. My first and last Susan Andersen book.
1, Fun and sexy romance: This fun read had everything needed to make it a good romance. The hero and heroine were both very likable characters with a lot of fun banter. I liked the premise of the story; having the twin sister mistakenly rounded up by a bounty hunter was a fun and entertaining plot. The story had the right mixture of action
0, fuentes: i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it. i was not searching for an instructors edition

0, Horrid Film: This is still to this day one of the most awful films i ever saw. I took a girl on a date for this movie and wow
0," EEWWW that smell!: The worst movie ever? This movie is marketed as being a ""Barney"" bashing movie"
1, One of my favorite movies of last year.: Every single person I know loved this movie. From the songs (I will find the soundtrack some day) to the great character acting
1," ""uh...uh...it's a rocket!"": ""Death to Smoochy"" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Robin Williams and Edward Norton were GREAT. The whole concept? No one puts Rainbow Randolph out of work! DIE SMOOCHY DIE!! I recommend this film to everyone (even if you're not fond of dark comedies).Totally original and brilliantly directed by Danny DeVito"
0, A Total Piece of You-Know-What: This is definitely one of the WORST pieces of rubbish I have ever seen. Robin Williams and Edward Norton are EXCELLENT actors
0, It's junk: The workmanship and quality is second rate. The handle is the only nice thing about the zester. The steel is literally junk.
0, Dull Channnel Knife: I purchased the OXO lemon zester specifically for the purpose of making long lemon garnishes for martinis and other beverages. It worked tolerably well the very first time but after that the channel knife was too dull to work at all. Was very disappointed.OXO Good Grips Lemon Zester. Am looking for a proper channel knife and would welcome suggestions.

0, Alice Lackluster: Don't know to whom this would appeal.Fine actors wasted on this attempt to breathe new life into a wonderful Victorian Era story. Nothing like the Wizard of Oz for fantasy and visual excitement. Young viewers I showed this to were immediately bored with its pseudo intellectualisms even an adult would tire of.

1, I'm in LOVE: A great mix of styles and great vocals.I recently discovered this CD and was not dissapointed.A must get!
0," Spend a little more to get a lot better: I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6"" utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy"
0, DRAB: I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento. It certainly didn't grab my attention. She provides a lot of detail..perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience. I would suggest another book on the Risorgimento over Riall's account such as Derek Beales.
0, not what I expected: I bought this for my daughter-in-law to help her find God's purpose in her life as she goes through this difficult time. What this book does is teach New Age theology and is not Biblical
1, Japanese anime(moving manga) is good translation.: Lucki sta(Lucky Star) is a high school ladies stories.There are no important things in the stories.But it is well presented Japanese high school days.People call a person without Mr. and Ms.Instead of Mr. or Ms.

0, Cute but not quality: The material this is made of just does not hold up when thrown in a purse all the time. The material frays all over the place and looked tacky within a month or two. I did not contact the manufacturer (I guess I should have) and just threw it in a bag for Goodwill. I would not recommend this for others!
0, problems with the display: After about a week
1," long knife: this story shows how the efforts of ""george rogers clark"" contributed to the growth of this country. we are used to hearing about the exploits of the revolutionary war but not often do we get a chance to know what was going on in the northwest territory. this is one of the best books i have ever read that covers how important a part was played by what was happening there. i recommend this book as an excellent read and most informative."
0, Couldn't keep me interested . . .: I have read several historical books in the past year. My dissappointment in this book stems from the fact that it spent too much time in the early going describing General Rogers' physique and general superhero status. I quickly lost interest in the subject. Still

1, Great memories: I was lucky enough to see this great play on broadway many years ago and owned the LP. Needed to upgrade my music collection to more modern times (AKA CD) The story is still so true in today's society so the music was still very enjoyable. We lost a great composer and singer with the passing of Anthony Newley.
1, This is a difficult book but a good book.: I learned that wolves communicate and have territories and there are no-wolf zones. I never knew that people could talk to wolves.

1," Great Christmas Eve Movie: Watched this with our kids and what a great Christmas Eve movie. We can remember when this movie came out and might have seen it in the theaters. Got many chuckles out of the kids asking ""what is that"" refrencing the walkman or original Pepsi bottles. Great movie and great time with the family."
1, WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN GOING ON VACATION !!!!: MOVIE #1: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND/ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION ....MOVIE #2: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION....MOVIE #3: CHILDREN LEFT ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS WORKING WITHOUT A NANNY IN HOMEE.....MOVIE #4: not yet watched by me....
0, Bummer!: Don't buy this thinking you are getting a Director's Cut. You get the movie with rambling talking over the whole movie. Normally when you buy something like this
1, fitful: I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived
1," home alone the christmas classic: i love this film macaulay culkin is a great actor and does great facial expressions...the plot as everyone must know by now is that an 8 year boy named kevin gets left behind at home as the family are goin' on holiday...and the burgulars that come too pay kevin a christmas visit have already been run to check the joint out as policeman..so kevin fills the house with traps yadda yadda yadda you get what i'm on about..get the film and forget about what ""JD"" OR ""JB"" they sucked too much dick and need to get a sense of humour so what if it doesn't all add up it's still a fantastic film so stop being an...polictal correctness weed will ya?"
1," Fun movie: I love to watch this movie around Christmas. While not technically a ""Christmas Movie"" it does take place during the holiday season. The robbers are a little too over the top for my adult taste but after all the movie is targeted to kids so I can over look that."
1," We need to get this man more attention!! He is great.: Let me just say record companies who passed him up are making a mistake. This is quality real life good music. As is all of Rhett's music. ""That Girl"" is a song all of us guys seem to relate to and it makes us smile. Rhett is so right in ""Trouble With a Woman"". This is a perfect CD to listen to with your dad while out fishing or driving around the countryside with your high school buddies. And there are the songs that you will want your girl by your side as well. ""Livin' Right"" is my favorite song of all time! It is my story. It's beautiful. Everyone get this because you'll enjoy it and we owe it to the great Rhett."
1, A great read!: This piece of fiction is worth your time. It is written by one of the world's foremost authorities on military snipers and is the only technically accurate work of fiction about snipers I have ever come across. It is well written
1, History: This book came alive. I wanted to be there
1, a classic: This classic moved me to tears in parts. Although it is wordy compared with modern writing
1, An important learning experience on the system of slavery.: This novel portrays the unjust and cruel accounts of slavery through the lives of some very unique characters. The reader goes through some vauable life experiences with each one of the characters to see how slavery affects them personally. By doing this
1, Uncle Tom's Cabin: I purchased this book for my son. It was required reading for his 11th grade Honors English class. He needed this book ASAP because as usual
1, What a Suprise!: I had heard of Uncle Tom's Cabin all my life and finally decided to read it. What a wonderful suprise! It is well written
0," Not Faithfully Reproduced: This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it. In my edition at Loc 2416 appears ""I don't know either about religion's being up in the market"
1, A Powerful and Moving Book: It is easy to see why this book became the clarion call for abolitionism prior to the Civil War. The narrative is riviting and powerfully wrought with characters so vividly rendered I felt I could almost reach out and touch them. I first became acquainted with excerpts of this book in high school but never read it in its entirety. Now that I have finally completed it 46 years lager
0, Long and stupid.: I didn't really enjoy reading this book. The language was too archaic for me to read (and understand) it. Don't read this book.
1, book: This book has to be read to understand the impact it had on America. Words alone cannot describe the emotions one feels when reading it
1, something to think about: Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the 1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave
1, one of my all-time fav CDs: I instantly fell in love with Le Tigre
0, 2 girls
0, Just ok: I used it for the first time last night. Worked well as far as the pounding part but I put it in the dishwasher and it came out dull with lots of gray stuff rubbing off. That is why I replaced my old one that had belonged to my mother. If you can't put a meat pounder in the dw what good is it.
1," ""Good Grips"" Tenderizer: The OXO tenderizer does it's job remarkably well"
0, A Letdown: the movie promised much and delivered nothing!! Two stars for the actors who did a good job with a lousy scenario and plot.
0, The Signal: The actors were fantastic but the film itself contained too much blood
0, Has no meaning but killing and beating each others: This movie has no meaning or story to tell except beating and killing each other for no reason from start to end.
1," Great to see you again Toni!: The beautiful Toni Braxton has made an excellent comeback with her single ""He Wasn't Man Enough For Me."" It is a song filled with energy"
1, He wasn't man enough: well tony i thing that this song is very good actually it is great. I like this song because i have just got out of a relationship and the girl is worred about me and she should be worring about he. He's a cheater 
1, Relaxing: This is a relaxing CD that i enjoy listening to when i get home from work or have had a stressing day in general. Well worth listening to

1, Worth it: I think Mary-Kate and Ashley are great on this DVD. I really enjoy this new show of theirs and this particular DVD really makes them seem older and it's funny. Plus there are cute boys. Another fabulous point
1," message from a pro: Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their ""secrets"". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell"
1, Excellent Blackjack book: The best beginners blackjack book around. I found it not only presented a very workable system
1, Highly recommended!: This is a very easy system to learn
1, I made money with this book!: I actually made money in Las Vegas after reading this book! Did I get rich..NO
0, Out Dated and Stale: While the KO system gives players a slight advantage
1, A Solid Book - though a touch dated.: This book gave a solid grounding in what is available and a broad idea of how to use each of the options
1, Lenox Christmas Table Cloth: Perfect
0, Fits buts needs modification: Not a drop-in replacement. Needed to cut a piece of plastic flange to get it to fit. Overall it works and matches the original.
0, Awesome Gadget: This thing scoops out rock hard ice cream so easily. I've gone through many ice cream scoopers and I stuggled with all of them. Yes
0, fun at times but ....well stupid: Sure this album presents a reason for you to bob your head. It allows you to have fun. but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in. While many view the uk subs as punk pioneers i feel they are in all essense just another band. The album drones on for what seems like hours
1, Val Kilmer Pulls A Rabbit Out Of The Hat: In the first three minutes of this film
1, Nothing is as it seems: Val Kilmer's character warns the viewer right at the beginning that nothing is what it appears to be. Is Kilmer Danny
1, Hornblower wins again!: This book continues the adventures of Horatio in to the Tropics. He has this great humility that comes across as hilariously funny
1, Definitly a Light Read: This is a nice little book. Princess Alesandra goes to England to escape an almost insane general who wants to marry her. She goes to England to find her own husband so General Ivan would not be able to force her to marry him. In a roundabout fashion she marries Colin. Seperately these are two wonderful people and I liked how they worried about each other
0," not worth the time of a long time fan: This story greatly disappointed me. The character of Princess Alesander has great similarity with Christina from the book titled ""Lion's Lady"". Both make the hero confuse and make you laugh to read their act in trying to understanding the lady. It's fun for the first time fan. But not worth the time of a long time fan like me"
1, Classic.: From the moment track one begins until the final fade out
1, A brilliant book for the beginng investor or corporate executive: Mr. Buffet does a remarkable job of simplifying the complexities of investing. His homespun stories and self-deprecating humor make the subject matter entertaining
0, Good General Knowledge But Needs More Information: I just read this guidebook for the second time. It provides a good overview of living in Mexico
1, Tonny Harnnel debut: This is the Tonny's debut on TNT and shows exacltly why he stayed therte for over 20 years. Seven Seas is still as good today as it was then ans all tne other songs are great too. Must have for fans.
0, boring and poorly written: I don't know how anyone could have enjoyed this book. It's horrible! There's no plot in Persian Nights whatsoever and I practically fell asleep every time I tried to read it. After reading and enjoying Le Divorce I found this book by Diane Johnson to be far worse. I recommend this book be avoided by anyone who does not want to sit through a slow
0, Ugly Americanism!: The title of my review states my opinion ofthe book . I will not waste my time any further
1, Classic Diane Johnson
0," Campy in the extreme!: This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of ""The Klansman."" Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville"
1, Best Jung book for the layperson: This book was written with the layman in mind
0, Not happy: When I got my nozzles
1, High quality ricer: This was a gift for my sister-in-law. She was thrilled with it! It has a nice long handle
1, Perfect mashed potatoes: This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow
1, Mashing Made Easy: Mashed potatoes is a pinch with this product! The press is well constructed with durable materials and dyes that easily pop out for cleaning.Pros:-heavy-quick-relatively inexpensive but good quality-easy to cleanCons (but manageable!):-heavy (another style may be better for people with joint issues)-potatoes sometimes squeeze through the top-does require scraping bottom to remove potato (apparently other styles come with a feature that swipes the bottom clean for you)
1, best cd purchase i've made(3 years ago)still my favorite: I own three of elliot smith's cds. either/or
0, Self Promoting: I bought this book hoping for stories of ghostly legends from New England. What I got was some guy who considers himself a ghost hunter that has a friend that supposedly can connect with the ghosts that haunt the places they visit.Reading this book was like watching a TV special
1, Bmod book: Book in perfect condition. Thanks for getting it to me relatively quickly and at a good price!
0, This product is a joke: I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course
0, No changes here: I do like crossing the t's on the top
0, kind of boring: You know 
0, Skip it!: Very basic book that covers no new ground. Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book. You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.
0, OXO Fail.: I love OXO. I thought they could do no wrong. But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money. We had an old stainless steel one without the handles
1, useful: Since I am partially disabled
1, Great corer/slicer for the price: I have owned one of these before and am on my second one. This utensil has been used
1, Awsome Set: Saw this show live and it was awsome! If you closed your eyes you'd have thought you went back in time 30 years. As tight as ever. They've lost NOTHING over the years (except maybe a little hair).
0, Don't Bother: This brush didn't last a month. The bristles are too soft and become deformed. I last used it when I steamed cleaned my barbeque grill and then tossed it.
1, Not a review
1, Beyond The Shackles: Gripping
0, Agree that OXO could have done better: PROS: Cuts well enough for my kitchen use; comfortable to grip w/extra large opening for fingers and no place to get my thumb stuck as has happened w/other scissors; fairly easy to take apart/assemble for cleaning & sharpening.CONS: The locking latch flipping into the locked position during use is a major flaw; the handles come completely together so you have to be careful not to get the skin of your palm pinched (trust me
0, Loose screw: I received these shears as a gift. Shortly after the first use
0, mine broke too - a stain upon the good reputation of OXO: as an oxo-ite
0, Way too flimsy!: Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese. After writing this review
0, Broke After a few Uses: I bought it because I thought the design was innovative and useful. It grated OK a few times
1, excellent grater no problems: Contrary to the claim of some other reviewers
0, Worked well for a while...: This grater was nice
0, Huh?: After watching this movie
1, SACD's Rock: Great disc originally and now even better. Sounds excellent at home on my SACD player
1," Deserves Its ""Classic Album"" Status: Elton was so prolific at this point that he could release 5 studio albums in 3 years"
1, Probably his best era: In my opinion this is probably the best era for Elton John as well as many other musicians during that time. Not that I'm casting any doubt on the fine quality of his music in succeeding years
1," The Best of Elton: This is a landmark album for Elton John. It contains many memorable melodies and lyrics from one of rock and roll's most prolific and talented songwriting teams since Lennon and McCartney. Elton shows off his incredible piano abilities and tremendous voice on such varied songs as the gorgeous ""Candle in the Wind"
1, The Greatest Album of All Time: This is with out a doubt the most inspiring album that I have ever heard. To put it more simply
1, Absolutely his best album: This is Sir Elton at his finest. Before he turned too pop
1, Stunned at how good the sound on this SACD: I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did. I was floored at the sound quality and the perfection of the mixing job for a 5.1 system. I never appreciated this album fully until now. Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's.
1, So it's derivative... so what?: Like at least these guys have good taste about who they borrow from. Heck they sound like the Beatles

1, Friendship triangles: Everyone has experienced the rejection
0," Shameless and misleading: ATTENTION AMAZON:I recently found out that this so called ""V. Productions / Ron Allen"" is none other than Richard Myles himself and that he goes around self promoting himself under aliases on various review boards and bashing his competition (see the scathing comments toward Chris .R. Notarile right here).Check out his reviews here on Amazon and you will see that in most cases"
1, The easiest grater: This grater has the best design available. You squeeze the body of it while turning the knob on top (sort of like a peppermill with a turning handle). Makes light fluffy grated cheese easy
0, Piece of Junk: ...the head twists off if you apply even the smallest amount of presure. On top of that
0, god awful: i purchased this camera on this site nearly a year ago. since that time
1, Don Camillo will pep you up to kick any rascals in humour: My home library contains some fabulous titles from Signor Guareschi. Over the years my wife and my brother and I have started guarding them with our lives. Particularly the above title. What a sublime humour and a bygone era. I went to Italy to see Palmar and the river Po. Made lot of Italian friends on that trip. Read Guareschi. Particularly the House that Nino Built.
0, RIP OFF!!!: This is nice looking and well made . . . with one exception. The wires break after very little use. I have two of these and have used them no more than half a dozen times (on medium to soft cheeses) each when the cutter wires broke. The rip off is that the replacement wires by the manufaturer cost another $14.00 for just three wires. Somebody's making some money here: but they won't get any more of mine.MOD
0, price too high for what you get: book was flimsey and the price on the book was less than I paid pretty sure it was a used book whats up with that?
1, Great cookbook: This is my frst cookbook by Jamie Oliver but it wont be my last.I enjoy his style of cooking which is about using healthy and good foods and making delicious but not complicated food.The cookbook itself is full of yummy color pictures of the dishes and was gorgeous just to look at.
1, Easy and colorful: It's a great book
1, This DVD is tropical HOT with crankin' music: I bought Hip Hop Bad Girls Brazil. This DVD is AWESOME!!!. The women have glorius rear ends and there are butts-a-plenty. I have never been teased better by a video than this one. The night time sky of Rio is breath taking in some of the shots and the women are strikingly beautiful. It's a very interesting concept. The hip hop tracks behind the booty is phat. This DVD is silicone-free unlike MOST DVD's of this type. All natural booty..uh..I mean beauty. Plus there are SO many upskirt teases and hot babes on the beach. More please... give me more.
1, Great...: Great quality and a lower price

1, LIBERACE: AN AMERICAN BOY: THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LIBERACE BOOKS. PUBLISHED BY
1, GREAT MOVIE !!!: I've always loved this movie. I think I originally saw it on H.B.O. late one night. The movie never got any recognition. That's probably why it was only showed at 3 A.M. Those time slots are usually reserved for movies that skipped the movie theatre and came straight to video. This movie is not available on D.V.D. (as of August 16th
1, Takes the Pain Out of Getting the Cork Out: I'm not a wine connoisseur
0, strangely disappointing: Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item
0, Oxo Corkscrew: Don't waste you time and money on this corkscrew. It broke within the first week's use...good concept
1, 6 months - so far: Flawless: I've been into sampling wine now for about 6 months. I read the reviews
1, Best Revenge: How Theater Saved My Life and Has Been Killing: This is a terrific book. It's a great read
0, I suppose I should have seen it coming: Jars of Clay has gone from being a really good band
1, SHOCKS AND SURPRISES ABOUND: Bestselling author Delinsky broadens her field with her latest by adding a touch of mystery to romance. Voice performer/director Sandra Burr offers a highly listenable reading to this tale of three women - one of whom is missing.Sisters Savannah and Susan are rivals
1, Hands Down: My Favorite Common Album
1, Resurrecting hip-hop: This is a great cd. I just got it and I have gotten addicted to this true style. Common showcases pure genuis in I used to love her. And book of life. Any one who loves hip hop should buy this cd.
1," Common: Resurrection is an awesome album. Produced in 1994 it broke the mold of the gangsta rap that was so prevalent. A very musical album with songs your sure to play over and over again; Common's ""Resurrection"" is a must have."
1, Common is what Hip hop suppose to ...Be: Ok
1," Buy This Album At All Costs!: This C.D. is unquestionably one of the best hip-hop albums ever. If anything has ever qualified as a must-buy then it is ""Resurrection"". In fact it was my favorite album until Mos Def's ""Black on Both Sides"" came out. Now I like both but in different ways. While Mos Def's C.D. is a masterpiece in it's creativity and sound"
1, Too funky!: FOXY BROWN is my favourite Pam Grier movie (with COFFY a close second and JACKIE BROWN third). This soundtrack opens with a bang with the instrumental CHASEand then never lets up. Brimming with funk
0, * WARNING: THIS BOOK'S BEST USE IS AS A DOOR STOP! *: ...so S T O P; don't buy this book. It's Junk. Anyone who's been in the profession a while knows it because many of us received it as a Designer's Book Club intro title in the late 80's or early 90's. It wasn't worth the cost of its S&H! Ask around to people in the profession and look it over first. I received mine while having just a few years of experience in practice. Initally excited and impressed with myself having identifed a clear technical error
0, Piece of Junk: Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly. The following day
1, Excellent jazz!: Heard some of this cd on a nightly jazz program (local NPR). Ordered it immediately. it arrived early and was in excellent shape.
1," The Don Ellis ""Farewell"" Recording: Live at Montreux (1978) was Ellis's final recording. This recording offers reflections of the more adventurous Ellis ensemble recordings on selections such as ""Future Feature"
0, Does not grab: This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs. The point is sharp.
1, Excellent clips / very sturdy: These clips are excellent - brightly colored

0, IT TAKES A THIEF: AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUTH PRICE IS!THAT LITTLE JAZZ CLUB THAT RUTH OWNS (THAT SHE PASSES OFF AS) ANON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS ANYTHING BUT NON-PROFIT. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WOMEN WHO CALLS HERSELF A MUSICIAN
0, Low rating is for the Afterword: I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson.This afterword
1," ""Scary"" Book: I thought this book was pretty good. This book was a great English thriller who horrified the English people in old England. I gave the book four stars because at some points it got confusing. The book was meant to be scary but today it is nothing compared to what we have today. The story is about a man name Dr. Jekyll who creats a potion to turn him into another man named Mr. Hyde so he can do his dirty work. The book is suspenseful and is a great mystery. The surprise ending and constant suspense builds this book up to be a pretty good book. This book could have been better if it had more mystery and more action. I also think the book could have been written in 10 pages or less (this book is for everybody who peeks at the end before finishing). Other than that I would recomend it to mystery and horror lovers."
0, huh: Don't remember getting this. Good book regardless. Guess it was from a mobile app. Anyways I do recommend it still. Enjoy
1, A Brilliant Story! READ IT.: Stevenson draws you deeper and deeper into this chilling tale of a frightening addiction. Dr. Jekyll is a man exploring the soul
1, Just so you know: The book was great in my opinion. But it is slow as is the case with other books written in this time period
1, A book that has stood the test of time: Who hasn't heard of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Whether it be in Newspaper reports of daily conversation
1," Timeless: This is a great classic. This story brings to life the battle each one of us has within ourselves. Dr. Jekyll calls it his ""dualtiy of purpose"". The struggle of good versus evil; told in that colorful language of classics."
1, A Good Quick Read: Mr. Hyde is a known murderer. Dr. Jekyll is a honorable doctor in the scientific community. These people's lives should never cross
0," Some parts are good: I like the demos by one of the presenters that showed some of Brian's guitar ""tricks"""
1," the ""ultimate"" edition for superheroes.: I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better"
0, This Book is Nonsense: This book is misleading.According to geneticist Cavalli-Sforza's research
0, What next?: Blame a victim anyone? I will say nothing about the author's motives. Perhaps this one will be posted. Posted on 5-12-07.
1, The ratings on this book speak to how important it is...: Noel Ignatiev's well-researched and well-argued book is incredibly important to understanding the way race has been constructed in the United States and the way that white people are deeply involved in that racial hierarchy - whether they want to be or not. Looking at the reviews of the book it is clear that many of my fellow white people are incredibly uncomfortable with these realities
1, heavenly chime: this chime has so much sound. It resonates in the air for longer than I had expected. Definetely worth the value. Good Buy! :)
0, Incorrect Movie: This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.
0, Simplified 12-Step Program: We used this in my recovery group and I found it more than useless to anyone who can read at a high school level or above. It's a very simplified version of the 12-step programs repackaged. Now
0, spun out after only a month: I had been happily using a very inexpensive salad spinner purchased at IKEA for about ten years. It finally gave out when the plastic part on the inside began to break. I was ready to replace it and thought I might even get something that would be easier to use. I read the reviews for the OXO spinner and thought it sounded great. However
0, Sorely disappointed: This was on my wishlist for a sometime. I love salads
0, Piece of Junk: This thing is a piece of junk. When you try to spin it fast enough to get the water off it jams up. Dont waste your $$$
1, Oxo Salad Spinner: Oxo Good Grips Salad SpinnerI don't know why I waited so long to order this. It's absolutely wonderful.
0, Used 3 months than it cracked!: I bought this because it was a small size for storage. First it doesn't spin out real well because of design. Second after about 8 uses the top cracked! I never put it into the dishwasher. Would I buy it again? NO. Can I return it? NO
0, order never recieved: Ordered From Amazon
0, Recommended cleaning resulted in broken product: I'm very disappointed by how easy it was to break the lid when trying to disassemble it GENTLY to follow the cleaning instructions provided with the product. Its spinning ability seems to deteriorate with weekly use after the first month. Cheap! I will NEVER use this model
1," What did I do without it: I love it. I use it for all the greens we get in our ""greens share."" Herbs"
0," Can't get my greens dry!: I bought this spinner because of the great reviews but I'm having a big problem in that I can't seem to get my lettuce dry. No matter how many times I've spun it there still seems to be a fair amount of visible water. Based on the reviews I expected to get ""crisp"
1, Salad spinner review: Very good quality spinner. Large capacity (not easy to store if you have a small kitchen) makes it easy to wash and dry two large heads of Boston lettuce. Also used to wash herbs
0, OXO OKO: The spinner works well
1, Great Spinner - could use a seperate lid: I originally purchased this salad spinner back in 2006 and used it regularly. A few weeks ago
1, Take your salad for a spin...: This is a great kitchen item to have
1, Really good product!: Great salad spinner! Sooo much better than my electric one. The bottom stays still while spinning. And it really gets all the water off my lettuce.
1, friends request an it was perfect: it was just what she wanted and came fast. she had not been able to find it anywhere in local stores
1, outstanding spinner!!!!: I LOVE MY SALADS!! I;M VERY PICKY ABOUT WASHING MY SPINACH BEFORE I CREATE MY SALAD. THIS OXO IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SPINNERSI EVER USED . IF YOU LIKE SALADS LIKE I DO . YOU NEED TO GET THIS OXO LETTACE SPINNER.C.INFUSINOCHICAGOLAND
1, A great way to spin sprouts: My primary purpose for this purchase was to spin sprouts. Seems silly
0," Not A Great Way To Get Acquainted With The Pixies: ""Surfer Rosa"" and ""Doolittle"" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation"
1, This band is amazing: This album has everything and more. This is a complilation of some of the best Pixie songs ever written
1, Good vibrations: The sound of these chimes is soothing and very rich for the size of the unit. I am very pleased with the mood that it sets.
1, It will be hard to beat this one.: This is my favorite CD
0, I Admire West Point
1," What scares the hell out of *you*?: ""Scare Tactics"" is bone-chilling and creepy. Without much ado it grabs you by its deadly fascination right from the start and will not let you go until you turn to the final page. With colourful descriptions"
0, This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour.: We purchased this book in preparation for a road trip in Spain. The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose. The descriptions of locations and drives are scanty and the photos look about 25 years old. This time
1, PSX best console ever!: The Playstation is by far the best console that i have ever played
1, I think that this game console is one of the best!: I thought that this game console has great graphics and the amount of entertainment and fun theat you can get out of your money i amazing. Although it is slower than nintendo 64
1, PSX: Still the best option: The PlayStation has been beaten out in the hardware race by the PC
1, Very fun system with lots to do!: This is a very good system to have. It provides many
0," BJBichon on ""My Parrot"
1, I love this coring set!: The corer is wonderful. It takes some pressure from the user to work (obviously) but it cuts the apple into perfect sections and the corer itself cleans up very easily. We are very happy with our purchase.
1, Not all Christmas-themed
0, CCR OPD: This is one bad album from the once great band. Well
0, Agree with previous reviewer: I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although
1, Great quality: What can you say about OXO products
1, Would buy again..: I use tongs for just about everything I do in the kitchen. The rubber handles make these tongs one of my top rated kitchen items. They can get greasy or wet and they still won't slip. Another bonus to is that the rubber on these help heat and cold resistance. I use this alot to turn food in the oven and they haven't burned me once. They also grab small items
1, Sturdy with a great locking mechanisim: These tongs a little more expensive
0, Does not live up to expectation: I'm a big fan of OXO Good Grips products -- my peeler
0, Lock broke
1, delivered as described: I bought this book for my son who is reading it in school. It was in the condition described. Used very good. The kids in his class seem to like the book. Bandix delivered it quickly
1, A very funny book.: I think this is a great book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. Kids should read this book because it is funny when Matilda uses her powers. It is about a little girl who wants to go to school but her father won't let her. So she plays jokes on him with her powers until he finally lets her go to school.
1," Praise for Matilda: I would give four stars to Matilda by Roald Dahl. This book is a 4 star book because it was very interesting but not the best book I have read.Matilda is a genius child with idiotic parents who are very mean to her. They do not care about Matilda at all they think she is not intelligent and that they are. At school Matilda has to deal with Miss ""The"" Trunchbull"
1, Matilda: Do you know some one who is smart and could do magic? I read the book Matilda. It was about a girl named Matilda. She was very smart and she was magical. It all happened in Worn wood's house. Every morning Matilda's mom would go to bingo and her brother would go to school every morning. Her mom would leave her alone. By that time she would know how to take care of herself. As you can see her mom would not take care of her. When she turned 4 years old she already knew how to read. Matilda's dad would work as a crook and he didn't care about school or reading a book instead he would stay watching T.V. I recommend this book because it is an interesting book and a funny book. I don't want to give the rest so if you want to find more about the book why don't you read the book!
1, Great story: Such a great story for little girls today. It's not about being the prettiest girl or having an attitude
1, Matilda: I think this is a great book for kids at age 10 to 13 or 14. I really like this book because it is very interesting and magical.I think that it is much better than the movie or DVD because it has some different information than the movie. I don't understand why they change some parts from the book into the movie. Well any ways Matilda is a very great
1, The Ups and Downs of Matilda: Matilda was a very smart girl and learned to read much faster than the other kids. She acctually wanted to go to school
1, Really nice fit. Simple as that.: I'm super peculiar when it comes to Jeans. I can't stand anything that's skin-tight. Can't stand inseams that squeeze my ... gonads. But I'm not into the ultra saggy
0, aunt bam's: The quality of the dvd was excellent
0, No No and No.: Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.
1, great message: great job Tyler loved this. this is a great play that a lot of single moms needs to see if some ppl stop putting so much energy into their ex life maybe they can move on with life
0, Too Firm
1, WHATS REALLY GOIN ON!: THE BEST OF ALL TIMES (AND TO THINK THIS WAS RELEASED JUST 7 DAYS AFTER I WAS BORN)! THE ALBUM COVER SAYS IT ALL.
1, Such A Rich History Behind This Release -- A MUST HAVE: As a huge Marvin Gaye fan
1, to all haterz: who ever alblum was lame ur lame to that dude said this worst album 2 u eat a fat d**k
1, More than a woman...!: Aaliyah is more than a woman! She's an angel! Her voice
1," Aaliyah's Best Album Ever!!: I've always been a fan of Aaliyah. Her personnality seemed so down to earth. Through the years I watched her grow from a young teen into a beautiful woman. You never really heard much about her personnal life because she wasn't the type to put herself out there like that. That's what I loved about her the most. She always stayed on the ""DOWN LOW."" Her third album is the best album ever. From beginning to end. Even though I never met her I wish I could of had the chance to tell her how much her music changed my life and how proud I was of her.You will be deeply missed LIYAH! R.I.P. Babygirl."
1, Girl to Woman: Aaliyah has definitely grown up. The songs are about love
0," good singles but this is album is lacking!: i Think Aaliyah is talented but i would not call this album one of the best cd's i've ever heard. although the songs like ""rock the boat"" and ""more than a woman"" are really good the rest of the album is (sorry Aaliyah)very lacking"
1," ""A"" Is For Aaliyah!!!: How should I say this? Aaliyah has come a long way since the year of 1994 with her debut album"
1, Aaliyah at her best: This CD truly shows Aaliyah at her very best. Her trademark fallseto voice is displayed
1, BANGIN BEATS: This album was a great contribution to the current state of music. Aaliyah's music was never one to be in the normalcy but she really blew us away with this album. She showed us her womanly attitudes and she shared her sexiness with us in a real classy way. I like this album and will keep it in the stereo for a while.
0, keepin it real: Yo she was an o.k. singer
0, Is he running out of subjects to write books on: This author has over 20 different books. I have read afew and found them to be consistant in quality
0, Stuffy: Published in 1955 - I have never ever cared for this volume and until I read The Mystery of The Aztec Warrior thought it was the worst in the series. To me I always found it a suffocating book and I can't explain why. Tony plays a prominent role in this one and to the books credit at least they encounter the criminals a fair amount and there is a little action. The latter chapters were fairly decent. Its worth reading - once -but honestly compared to the other volumes in my opinion this is among the cellar dwellers. (Almost a 2 Star - but not quite) RATED D
1, Woodstock Emperor Gong Chime: This wind chime is beautifully constructed of high quality materials. It has a very low
1, Blazing hot: Of all the young artists who are now over produced
1," Real Music !!!! and an amazingly gifted Singer---GREAT CD !!!: I have been so disappointed in music lately....drum machines on top of drum loops...and rehashed samples...etc....hardly any ""real"" musicians on most current popular music....basically music with no soul or feeling to it.....This new CD by the Brand New Heavies is just what the current state of music needs right now !!!! A real band"
0, Not good for scrubbing: Too soft
1, Amazing brush: I started using this as a general pre dishwasher scrub brush based on another Amazon review I saw on this product. I also use it to clean the sink and to clean out my recycling cans and bottles. It is the best overall cleaning brush I have ever used. The long flexible handle allows access to almost any item. I pop it in the dishwasher periodically and even the most stubborn food items come off - things like scrambled eggs and bread dough. It has held up well under heavy daily use for the last three months. And that is a record for me as I'm pretty hard on cleaning tools. I just added it as a permanent item on my shopping list.
1, Extra arm!: It reaches where my arm can't
1, Cleaning was never so easy: My wife always had issues while cleaning my stainless steel thermos that I take to office filled with coffee. The opening is so small that washing it becomes a pain. The other day she was telling me about the OXO good grips bottle brush; she is able to clean my thermos without any worry. The bristles are soft yet firm on the base and side walls that it does not leave any scratch. Even after repeated use the brittles remain firm and have not lost its shape. The handle has a decent grip and despite using with soap does not slip. The length is also pretty convenient for cleaning elongated bottles. It is a must have in any household.
1, Soft and Flexible: I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
1, Great bottle brush!: I needed a brush to clean the inside of my Takeya water bottle. This brush did the trick. It feels good in your hands
1, Bottle Brush: I needed a bottle brush for my water bottles that I take to work and to the gym. This product is just right. It has the perfect length and the brush bristles aren't to coarse.
1, Hank just can't seem to win: Hank
0, Not the least bit entertaining: David Harum is an old guy who loves to tell long
1, Home Owner: This was great
1, Good Material
0, Felt Scatterbrained.: I felt the booked lacked a lot. The art was great but i learned nothing from the book in regards to writing. I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
0, Really
0, Not the best!: Loved the film when it first came out and have seen it many times since. There is only one song on this CD that creates the excitement experienced when you watch the movie
0, Piece of Junk: This stapler is not worth a penny. It constantly jams. Every time I reload
0, paperweight: Garbage
0, If you buy this staple gun buy a hammer also: I bought this staple gun because staples are not being made for my 40+ year old Bostitch any longer
0, Totally useless: Purchased this a few weeks ago to clean tile grout.Bristles bent out of shape after a short time.OXO usually makes good products but not this one.A loser.
1, Use for dishes: The best brush I've ever had to clean food off dishes and pots before washing. After a year
1, This book rocks!: The authors have a refreshing collective voice
0, A complete waste of time: This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you
1, Good quality
1, this is NOT PERFORMED BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE: all other songs are sung by the familiar artists
1, son's movie: The family enjoys this movie
0, If You Hate Your Kids: Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage...: Wait
1, LOVED IT: Yes im a Grandma....but I bought this for me.....I do have GP's as pets as well.....and I can see there personalities as is the case in this fun film......I really enjoy watching it and it brings lots of laughs and so do a couple of my friends enjoy it as well.yes the grandkids will watch it with me
0, Phew...This movie stinks: Well
0, Bad Oxo Product: We love OXO products
0, Don't buy this one!: The first 2 songs are good indeed
1, Never leaves my side: I tend to over-stuff the front pockets and the flap does not alwaysvelcro close. But I tend to carry too much stuff.The unit is a great utility pouch and holds up well.
1," Definitely a ""Good Grip"": I have and have used at least 15 other vegetable brushes. All for the most part were decent. The OXO is a step above most but not perfect. The size is great for a small to medium size hand and adequate for a larger hand. The bristles are firm"
1, Great for even bigger hands: Once my family started eating a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes I found it necessary to purchase a good scrub brush as we like to leave the skin on.This is great
1, easy to grasp vegetable brush: large size of brush
1, Nice Brush: This brush is not your basic veggie brush. It fits nicely in my hands and it's rubberized grip is fantastic and non slip. The bristles are softer than many I have used
1, I am glad i made this purchase.: Probably the luckiest dollars i have used to purchase this vegetable brush. It's worth every penny. Just buy it
1, GOod
0, Horrible: Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped. Rolls all over the cabinet now.Don't buy......get a plastic board or the cutting sheets that sell for about $1.00
1, Interesting book: This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds
0," Terrible: An experiment:1. Listen to ""Splendor Solis"""
1, Even better on Vinyl: I just scored Jean-Luc Ponty's Enigmatic Ocean LP in mint condition
0, terrible writing style and unbelievable story: This author doesn't understand what a sentence is and how to complete one. Half of pages are filled with one 'sentence' making it incredibly difficult to follow the unnecessarily long
0, Tripe: I wouldnt read this intolerant tripe if it demonized the far left
0, Steaming pile of chick book: She's a good writer. Maybe it's the company she keeps. Anyone who likens this to 1984 or Brave New World is a twit. That's one of the tests you can keep in your toolkit.
0, Dull
0, I really found this book disgusting
0, dull
0, This book is horrible...: Those of you who like Atwood will enjoy this book
0, The Handmaid's Tale: My Book Club assigned this book. I never would have chose it on my own. And I certainly never would have finished it had I not been obligated to do so before my next club meeting.
0," handmaid's tale-really worth reading?: In my opinion ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood is a rather annoying lecture if you are not interested in the issue of dystopias and totalitarian states.Lenghty and very detailed descriptions of the everyday life of the protagonist might force the bravest readers to surrender.The basic idea"
1, good: I read this book because it was on the 100 books to read before you die
1, Ominous story of a future world: Atwood has masterfully written a tale of future world in which women are enslaved by zealots of a new world order. Her haunting epilogue of anthropologists clinically analyzing the remains of that world gives a somber tone to the end of the volume. I read this book in 1988 and again in 2013. It stands as a classic.
1, Haunting: I suspect that this book was a chilling read when it was published in the 1980's
1, Personal Freedoms: I think what Margaret Atwood's
1, A great book. Anyone willing to be shocked should read it.: What an excellent book. By following Offred's daily routine we learn about a frightening new society
0, A confused feminist view of the future: Only a confused and paranoid feminist could come up with such an story. This book (set in the not too distant future) is actually nothing more than an attack on conservative Christian values. The idea that right wing conservatives would turn all females into slaves if given the chance is absurd. I will give Atwood credit for creativity. However
0, a traumatizing experience: maybe she's a popular and celebrated author of our culture
1, Changed my life: I first read this book as a teen after it was named one of the year's best by Time. I was a fan of dystopian fiction
0, Learn Biblical Hebrew 2nd Edition by John Dobson - not useful for me: I was particularly interested in the CD
0, La Mer: OK way to try product with low $ price. Would not buy regular size. Use the La Mer cream all the time but this concentrate is not worth the $$$.
1," Perfect for classroom collections!: If you teach a young age students love this product for when you read ""Where the Wild Things Are"" I also recommend acquiring the Wild Thing Plush toys to accompany it."
0, Ruined my HD: This product does not come with any sort of instructions
0, Beware of who you order this through...: I ordered this from a company called HDE. They did not send me the Cables Unlimited product
1, Good Product: I am very convinced this product is very well made.I like everything about.I will tell my friends about it.Good job.
0, A slasher with gusto: Can you believe this movie is Francis Ford Coppola
1, Remove yer brain... it's Laymon!: When I see a book on the shelf by Laymon
0, Very Contrived: As an avid reader of horror fiction
1, Looking forward to CURSED: Reading SCREAM seven years after the initial impact of the film--and in movie terms seven years is definitely a whole generation later--I wonder if it would be a success if Williamson wrote the same material today. Some of it is very clever
0, Was he really a member of the Eagles...: Together with the other guys in Eagles
0, Not a DVD Audio: Beware
1, Great book on home architecture: This book offers a wide range of home styles from around the globe in almost 1000 pages (999 to be exact). With more pictures than text this is definitely eye candy for anyone who loves residential architecture. A+
1, Replacing a favorite: My mother bought this spatula for me 7 years ago
1, Just love this band: I just love this band. Lynott's melodic and sensible vocals
0, Good quality
0, the sound was not great: the sound was not too nice
1, Good value: I originally bought this strainer to make baby food for my son
1, Best yet: I actually bought this CD a couple of years ago as an import. It is easily the best work of Kotzen's to date. Quite a range of sounds from sweet and melodic to pure rock and roll in the form of The Stones or Black Crows. As always superb guitar work and vocals.
1, The real reason there are so many bad reviews here is. . .: due to a coordinated effort by a right wing web site that hates Oliver Stone and anybody else that doesn't share its ideological slant. They encouraged their members to write poor reviews to convince you that this movies is not worth your time. They are angry that Hollywood is able to make a movie about many aspects of Bush's life that were true
0," Stone goes easy...: but even that is cutting. You watch and say ""He was elected twice!"" What will future generations say?"
1, Surprisingly current: While this book was written almost a century ago it is surprisingly current with the economic situation we are presently in.
0, Awful....Terrible....Very poorly Acted: From the casting to the sets
0, Not what you see: I bought this swaybar bushing kit for the front of my 07 FX2.All you get is the bushing for the front swaybar to frame.No greasable brackets.or endlinks.I guess I didnt read good enough.
0, Mormon and Pychic based program: I was shocked to find out that this program is filled with Mormon theology. It is based on such theories as Suggestology
1, NICE LITTLE BOOK WITH SOME AMAZING RECIPES: I purchased this book to use with the Tortilla pan set and it has some really amazing recipes
1, Tortilla binge: This is a great little book with lots of neat ideas. The recipes are simple and use common ingredients. I used mine as a bunco prize with a jar of homemade salsa
0, not the best: This bottle opener is too thin and doesn't work really good. sorry
0," Mind corrupting Religious Indoctrination: -RE: (Book) ""Sound Health"
1, Sound advice for energictically healing yourself: One of THE BEST books I've read on sound and energetic healing.... and I have a HUGE library of integrative healing books! I enjoy the CD often... especially in the evening.
0, Sound Health Sound Wealth: This book is another self-help book. I enjoyed the book HOWEVER
1, Colunbia Vest: Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas. Beautiful red shade
0, Garbage: I couldn't agree more with the other negative reviews on this site. The depressions for the cubes are too small
0, Not for me: I bought this as a way to avoid freezer burn on my ice cubes..didn't work out very well for me. Still had freezer burn getting in and sliding the top on and off when filled with water was difficult and messy.I bought the tupperware covered trays at the same time as I bought these and I love them.
0, BE CAREFUL!!: These seem like a GREAT idea but they do not work! Water spills all over. These should of never made it through OXO product development!
1, works but don't overfill: These trays are very neat & work as designed for ice. We got them for baby food & found out quickly not to overfill them or the lid is nearly impossible to get off. I like that you can pop out just the number of ice cubes you need.
1, Great Radio Contacts: As an indie musician
1, Great!: Super BooK! I found here everything I needed!!! Everything! Even the most unknown radio stations!I even found a record store! It doesn't matter where you live because it has everything!
0, What is on this turtle's head?: This is a perfectly acceptable baby toy
1, A little known treasure....: This is an album that I had originally discovered in the late 80's as a young child
0, the worst movie ever [.]: Before I get started I want to make one thing clear. This is not a Jackie Chan movie! Jackie only comes in for a few scenes.And when he does appear he has a huge clump of hair on the side of his face! Dont get this movie confused with Jackie's box office smash Rumble In The Bronx. This movie is A.K.A. Police Women
1, Superb technique: Many of the reviews complain about Ewing's vocality
0, Motor was made in China!!!!: The motor was made in China. The first motor the gear did not mate up. It made a loud grinding sound. I returned it and the second motor worked OK
0, Defective Latch won't hold the motor to the bucket: I bought this and the first time I put it together the latch that secures the motor came right off. So I returned it and Amazon was kind enough to immediately send me a replacement. The replacement lasted a little longer. I was at least able to secure the motor and begin to use it when once again the latch came off and I had no way of securing the motor to the bucket. I'm returning it for a refund this time and shopping for a different freezer.
1, Works great!! If only...: ... it wasn't so noisy!Actually
0, Motor jammed after 2 minutes: Unfortunately I never got a chance to test this machine because the motor jammed up after only 2 minutes. I had barely started putting ice into it. I had guests coming over so was forced to go buy a cheap maker for the party. I am ordering a replacement that I hope will actually work.
0, Motor loud and quit working: Just after my warranty expired

0, mad chirping: this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this. we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system. when the chirping started about several months ago we didn't have a clue (and still don't) on how to stop it. there was no manual or instruction left. its electric and I don't know how to get to the battery. i can't believe they put these smoke alarms in new houses without a manual. after viewing all the negative reviews and seeing that the product is discontinued
0, Thank Goodness I'm not alone in this!: Good to know this is a problem with others as well! My husband and I were awakened a week ago to the alarms all going off @ 3 AM. We never could figure out what happened and thought maybe it was a power surge. Then last night
1," Tom Jones ""Love Is On The Radio"": Many years ago"
1, perfect and imperfect sagas: this is a good season and leads up to the cell gamessome good fights in this set that make it really coolthis is a must have
0, far too basic: Thsi volume is far too basic to be of much use beyond a first year Bible college class. For the seminary student or pastor looking for a good reference tool
1, My favorite all time jazz album.: Best jazz album ever. If you can keep still
0, quit working: this is one of the few items I have ever has to return. The fan stopped working just after two days. I did get a prompt refund from amazon.
0, worst fan ever: I purchased a Lasko fan and it only worked for 1 year. I cannot turn the knob to start the fan. The company has ignored my requests to replace the fan. This is a warning not to buy a Lasko fan.
0, Bad business: The fan pictured above is not the fan the company sends out. They send out a different
0, DOA: Almost bought this from Amazon
1, Good power and not too quiet.: This fan is doing an excellent job of pulling in the cooler morning air into my house down here in hot Florida.It has much more power than the similarly priced and smaller fans that I have.Also
0, Cheap but not worth it.: First day I had the fan
1, Required reading: If society is to ever evolve and embrace an ethic of compassion toward humans and animals
1, Fascinating look at 20th Century America: In America Reborn
0, Not compatable with Mac: I bought the Memorex cd/dvd label maker kit and the jewel case inserts and a box of 50 jewel cases today.CAN NOT DOWNLOAD MEMOREX SOFTWARE ON A MAC!!Then I thought
0, Software not compatible with Vista: I was more than excited to get started stomping out CD/DVD labels
1, label maker for cd's: This is a great product! It's easy to use
0, By HAND ONLY: Don't bother with this cheaply made gadget. It is so much easier and so much more accurate and so much faster to apply your CD labels by hand. Trust me.
0, Prints way off the mark: After hours of screwing around there is now way to print these labels on center. Finally I had to cut 1/2 inch off the top of the label page to get it somewhat close. You have 2 choices buy this or buy a bullet and rent a gun...you'll need it.
0, The book fails in its primary function
1, A Good Reference: This encyclopedia is a comprehensive reference of Ancient Rome. Through the years it has been very helpful in finding information about lesser-known Romans. In addition to being alphabetical
0, Item Pictured is not what is Shipped: I ordered 3 of these to replace 2 that I've had for nearly 15yrs. What I received were particularly cheaply made - poor effort knockoffs of the original 'CornerSpray' that is pictured.The product shipped is not labeled in any way
1, Powerful message sneaks up on you: I started reading this book and liked how straightforward and easy it seemed to identify my soft addictions and take steps to change them. As I continued reading and thinking about the book
1, A sweet read: Picking up this book and reading any page has been helpful for me to connect with myself and to other people. I have noticed my mood becoming lighter from reading it. I love the message
0, There Must Be More ...: Look at the cover photo. Have I said enough? This book is mindless drivel. I feel sorry for anyone who has actually read this insincere
0," No no no!: I think Malcolm X was the strongest and the most beautiful character stepped foot on US soil. So this movie by no means represent him or whatsoever (although it has his name on the Title). I think what makes this movie especially -poor- is the ""concerns"" of the director to give a message against Islam... If you are a muslim"
0, What was the Modern Library thinking?: The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first. Butler's pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters.
0, Better Than Bounty Huntrees: I wasn't surprised to see that this movie was not as good as it looked. To top it off
1, This book is an excellent research resource.: After researching for years and looking desperately for a good resource on Women in the Celtic times
1, Very good: It's the first time I got a good manual opener.My wife love it. I would like to recommend it to everyone
1, OXO Steel Can Opener: Works great. It is difficult to find a hand held can opener that works without struggleing to open the cans you are trying to get into. This one does the trick.
0, Not quite up to OXO standards: I wanted to wait to give this some usage before reviewing. Now that we have used it for six months
0, About Year Rusted: Oddly enough it rusts in only two places. One place you can scrub off the rust with a brush. However
0, When it worked
1, Works great
0, Terrible! Always leaves sharp edges.: When I ordered this from Amazon
1, Best can opener ever!: The title of my review says it all: this is the best can opener ever. Each turn is like a little slice of heaven. I don't really know what else to say about it other than it does its job amazingly and I love it.
1, The best!: This is the best can opener I've ever used! I've had mine for at least 5 years and it still works as well as the first day. I put it in the dishwasher regularly so I know that it's always clean and germ-free. I also bought one for my mom and for both of my sons.
1, good but not special: I have used swing-a-way brand openers for 30 years and they haven't changed a bit. This product is similar but slightly better
0, Bad choice of setting: I am from South Bend too and this author can go to hell on a hopscotch pad.Who doe s/ he think he is writing about a nice town that way. Funny thing is I bet h/she could not even point out South Bend on a map. This story is so unrealistic. Both of my brothers attended Wayland Academy (private prep school in WI) and both went to Harvard.. YES
1, The High Shool book: For me
1, Excellent portrait of a teenage girl: I love the concept of a middle class girl attending a high-priced boarding school so I probably would have been pleased with any novel that explored this topic. However
0, **SNORE**: First
0, Wish I could give it a negative star!!: This book was one of the most boring coming-of-age novels I have ever read. Lee Fiora bored the s#*! out of me
0, A cheap novel with some insights: This cheaply constructed story was engrossing but so full of self-absorbance and self-hatred and so pointless...A major disappointment and a sellout
0, Boring!: I was really disappointed in this novel
0, Grinds to a halt: This book started well
0," A disappointment: ""Prep"" was overlong"
1, Really Great: I was surprised to read any bad reviews about this book because I enjoyed it so much I practically read it in one sitting. It probably appeals more to younger audiences- I read it in high school and while Lee could be frustrating at times
0, Prep: I was so disappointed by this book. I never really got a grasp of the main character and I kept waiting for a climax in the book - which never took place. It is good writing
0, Long
1, I give it 4 Stars for a HighSchool Dramady: Think Mean Girls (Minus lindsay lohan plus Kristen Stewart)This book gives a very vivid picture of an outcast perspective of a Prep High School outside the Boston Massachusetts area.The main character is not likeable to the reader nor to anyone she comes in contact with in the story
0, Another prodigy
1, Great Teaching: Bruce & Mary do a great job explaining all facets of the golf game. I watched the video three times and picked up more good tips each time. The segments on conditioning and choosing equipment are unusual for golf instructional videos and were very well thought out. I recommend this tape to anyone who wants to take a few strokes off their game
0, Horrible: Natalie could have been a little more nicer to the audience instead of being a prude like she always was. You hardly could hear her voice
1, Love this movie....: I got this movie on time
0, Ok
0, Glad I read Triple Witch first: ...had I not
1, The Bowl of all Bowls: I was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day. I grabbed this bowl

0, So disappointed with this bowl!: Generally speaking
1, Great tool!: First
1, Good information
1, Almost what I expected...: ...they are inexpensive
0, Why not provide sizing chart?: I ordered this product from a third-party partner. While the tank was of excellent quality
1, Great chair!: This chair was a big hit with my 14 month old daughter.She loves this chair! So i am really happy that i bought it.Its very light to carry around and comfy for my baby to sit on while playing or reading books.It would have been helpful if it had more height
0, cute but does not last long: I bought this produce for the same reasons many other costumers provided here. It is cute
1, An excellent biography of one of Rome's greatest emperors: This book is an excellent overview of the life of one of the Roman Empire's greatest rulers. Williams explains how Diocletian emerged from the chaos of the late third century to pull the Empire back from the brink of disaster. Written in a crisp
1, 5-star SteeL: I've reviewed all my SteeL products 5-stars. Well built
1, The only peeler you will ever need: If you own a peeler now that is not an OXO
0, BUYER BEWARE!: From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed. First of all
1, The bible of homebrewing: If your interested in homebrewing
1," Get this book and start brewing!: I got this book as part of a homebrewing kit a year ago. It is probably the best beginners book out there for brewing beer at home. From the step by step instructions for making your very first brew to the many recipes for different beer styles and even a chapter on growing your own hops. This is the A-Z homebrew bible.The theme: ""Relax"
0, OK
1, Must have: Whether you bake pies or quiche or pizza
0, Characters could not hold my interest: I agree with an earlier reviewer
1, BUY IT!: Truly
1, Memorable drama for any baby boomer....: Thoroughly entertaining drama involving Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood in starring roles about unrequited love in times of tough family values and expectations.I have enjoyed this movie for decades on TV and VHS and now complete the circle with my own CD format.Handy hint: keep a box of Kleenex within easy reach!
1, phenomenal performance natalie!: can't imagine a more gut wrenching tortuous emotional scene than natalie grieving over her lost love
0, THIS IS NOT PILATES
0, Eminently Useless Collection of Arts & Crafts Wall & Wallpaper Designs: The description for this book is quite vague so allow me to clear things up before you waste your money. First there is a series of short but windy chapters dealing with various aspects of design philosophy. Forty pages worth
1, Mercy Rule is excellent: This is the best freaking album. Which Road and Tell tomorrow are songs to sing driving your convertable on the highway with the top down
1, Anybody who does not like this CD has no taste in music: All the people who gave this cd anything less than 4 stars are morons. Dont listen to them just buy the cd.
1, My granddaughter loves this book: It's full of fabulous full color drawings to inspire you. Has easy to follow step by step instructions. You'll find your favorite subjects are broken down into simple shapes that you fit together. It's easy to get the proportions right and learn to spot the basic patterns that buildup into a fantastic drawing.This book is packed with examples you will love to draw. The simple guidelines are so clear - even adults can follow them.
1, Awesome Allstar Artists!!!: Excelent. Not a bad perfomance in the group. Pruduction
1, These cats can play: I am a Jazz fan in the true sense
1, Some Real Jazz and Some Smooth Jazz: It looks good and sounds good. If you like jazz with a back beat
1, Full!: This is a complete collection of Music Studious
1, great assortment of clamp sizes: I debated ordering these for several months. I waited for a sale price or free shipping from Grizzly or Amazon
1, Graphic SF Reader: A story focusing on the ramifications of the attack on Snow White by Goldilocks
0, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This phone is a piece of crap!: When I first saw this phone I just had to have it. I loved that is was so slick and slim. No antenna was a nice plus as well. I really regret buying this phone!!! My biggest upset was the battery life. The day I recieved the phone I charged it and was ready to go. I made one THIRTEEN MIN phone call and it already needed to be charged. I went two or three days with the same thing happening and I finally took it back to the store. They(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that I would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn't got any better. I only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. I dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. The only upside to this phone is that its slender. I repeat Please Don't Waste Your Money!
0, Susceptible to Humidity: External display failed within one month. Moisture sensor dot showed red
0, Not for children: Although this book is about a 10 year old Samoan girl the subjects the author explores are adult. The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence. I'm not saying the book is without merit. It would surely have a place when studying modern polynesian cultures as an adult
1," Check ""Unknown Tongue"": A superb and solid album that is worth buying for the track ""Unknown Tongue"". This up tempo track features phenomenal use of the 'musette'"
0, Black and white pictures??: Very unhappy with this book. Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification. It has a lot of information and very small print. Seriously considering returning it.
1, Great spoon: Spoon is sturdy and the handle is so comfortable when I am mixing ingredients that I cannot use my Kitchen Aid mixer on.
1, serving spoon: So far I have been totally satisfied with every Oxo product I have ordered
1, Roomful Smokin' out of the Gate!: This is an incredible big band blues album. From the very get go Roomful were a force to be reckoned with. Its leader Duke Robillard is red hot! And the band follows in kind. A cornerstone modern blues album for sure.
0, Film as iconography: There are films that seem bad at first but open up when seen a second or third time. This is not one of them. The first two times I saw this film
1, From one musician to another...: These guys have talent. Not only talented musically but God has given Tim Neufeld and his brother Jon the ability to write deep lyrics full of truth. I always hate singers who sound great on cd but then different in concert
1, Beautiful: This is a collection of beautifully written songs that are beautifully sung and masterfully produced. I purchased their first CD a year ago (independently released) and I still love it a year later. These songs come from a deep place and are amazing as art and as worship.
1, A time in my life when we feared for our children's lives: This book brought back many painful memories of a time when we could not let our children out of our sight for fear they would be snatched up by this monster and found dead and mutilated
1, A Marvelous CD: This is an amazing young lady who has God in her life. Without God
0," ...quite boring...: I am a great Natalie fan. I found ""Ask a woman who know"" simply delicious...so this new album is quite surprysing to me as it is boring"
1, Can't Keep That Girl Down: September and October seems to have given us a bumper crop of albums by 'mature' artists and here's another by a truly great singer. This time out
1, The Real Thing: There are two types of get rich books: those written by professional speakers who make a living telling others how to be successful
1," The ""How To"" Guide To Becoming A Millionaire: There's a good reason Michael Masterson has almost half-a-million loyal readers of his daily email letter at EarlyToRise.com. It's because Michael is a highly experienced wealth-creator and an excellent teacher.Finally Michael has authored a book that offers a step-by-step plan for becoming financially independent in 7 years. I've followed Michael's teachings for about 3 years now. I'm in my mid-twenties and am earning as much as a lawyer or doctor between my business and real estate ventures. His strategies work! Your $18 investment in Automatic Wealth will pay-off a thousand times over!"
0, More 'Think and Grow Rich' Foolishness: The author suggests such foolishness as 'flipping houses' and volunteering free overtime to get 'in' with your employer. The author is the only one getting rich from this mess.
0, AWFUL vacuum. Don't bother.: This vacuum is terrible! I have had this vacuum for over 3 years now (one here buying a different one now). The filter clogs constantly and has to be cleaned or replaced just about every time I use it. I couldn't even tell you how many filters we have bought. I have longer hair
0, Is this a vacuum or a small jet?: This vacuum sucks
1, Little Green Machine: I have owned one of these vacuums for several years. I use it more than my large upright. My Eureka has a lot of power and it is easy for me to use because it is so light weight. I gave one to my Aunt for a gift just this Christnas.
1, lightweight
1, Move over Dyson...: the Eureka 431BXZ Optima lightweight Upright Vacuum although small in size is a powerful little wonder.. With the bagless filter that really filters the dirt and dust particle and the storage area for vacuumed item
1, A whole new Luffy: If you originally watched this series on Cartoon Network
1," Maddeningly incomplete: I agree with all the other reviewers who are frustrated at what got left off. Every time I put on disc number 4 and fail to find ""She's My Best Friend"" from the 'VU' album on there I'm reminded of this. I'm always left with the distinct impression that these record companies should let the fans compile the box sets.The band is great"
1, Must have for any classic rock collection: This is a great album. Songs range from soft hippie rock to totally wierd and dark. Must have for any Lou Reed fan.
0, Excellent music
1, a landmark album: This is one of the great albums of the 60's.. It represents everything experimental in late 60's art-rock.. There are the cool mellow vibrations of 'Sunday morning'
0, any help?: Does anyone recommend this album to a classic rocker? I'm only a teenager
0," review of the compilation: I regret that i got carried away by the recommendations given on my previous purchases as well as the other reviews on this compilation""Peel slowly and see"" is definitely one of the worst in my collection.It sounded more like a jam session by a not so talented garage band! Do i say more.Can i have my money back or atleast exchange the same for some better music?"
1, Excelent: The Velvet Underground & Nico (180 Gram Vinyl)I order this to gave it to a friend who loves it the disc was package in exelent condition 
0, I don't like it.: I've listened to this album repeatedly
1, An essential box set: This is the end all be all of compilations of any rock'n'roll band. We've got early demos
1, Nothing Left to Say!: After all this time and all that was said about this record (and band)
1, Confucius says baseball is wrong - man with four balls cannot walk: I've been looking for a real collection to complement the lame jokes I heard when I was a kid. This fit the bill.
1, great: Oscar Peterson with Buddy De Franco sound fabulous together on this cd of the very listenable Gershwin melodies. Oscar Peterson's small group is an ideal backing for maestro Buddy.
0, Not realy my type: I did not like this book. However
0, Good movie - poor technology: The movie would have been fine had the audio and video kept sync. Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart. Also
1, A multitude of reasons to watch this film: - Some good special effects involving the spaceship
1, Forbidden Planet - Cannot review as not available in Europe: I would love to review this film. I have been checking Amazon for 5 years awaiting a european release. This is THE Si-Fi classic - why isn't it available in Europe and the rest of the world?Whoever releases this DVD - please
1, KRELL STEEL!!: Unalloyed pleasures on the big screen finally get a Deja Vu on Deja Vee Dee!! The widescreen
0, A real disappointment: I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would be seeing the original CINEMASCOPE print of this sci-fi classic. Sadly the only frames in Cinemascope are the opening credits. The rest of this glorious film has been chopped up to accommodate a standard format. What a loss!
1, Forbidden Planet: Considering the year that this movie was filmed
1, Totally Awesome: Ok
1," Forbidden Planet Movie Review: This science fiction movie is one of the top five made in the 1950's and is even superior to the original ""War of the Worlds"" made in the 1950's. The story is truly a superior work as the events portrayed are possible in theory."
1, Classic: Robbie the robot - this robot has been used in so many other shows. The movie also gives some background into human mind. Id
1, Forbidden Planet: I have always liked Forbidden Planet. It on one of my favorite science fiction movies. I watch it every so often.
0, a rip off: i would not advise any one to waste their money on this blu-ray package for one main reason. sound track IS NOT 5.1!!! the entire movie soundtrack played out through my center speaker ONLY! the regular 2 disc 50th anniversary has the dolby sound. so if you have that stick with that and forget the blue ray until they decide to include a good sound track. i mean if you are watching a movie on the big screen don't you want surround sound too?
0, Total Garbage!: Very poor IR quality
0, Broke within two months: I purchased wireless headphones before that were not as fancy looking but that last me for a few years. This one stopped working after a couple of months. I'm a busy mom of three whose kids go to school far from my house. I drive 500 miles a week
1, SUPERIOR HORROR REMAKE!!: IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL
0, Sorry but this version did nothing for me: I know people are tired of hearing how remakes are bad and originals are best
0, Don't waste your money: I went to see this horrible movie with my father and I was dissapointed. How can people in the movie world get away with making such trash? I guess the real question is: Why do people pay money to see it? It is scary
0, This is a fake!: George and Kathleen Lutz
0, One Of The Worst Ghost Movies Of All Time: I just don't see how this could get such good reviews. It's an awful movie with awful acting and no horror at all. They should put this movie in the drama section so people who like horror movies won't buy it. The sequels are ok and would get a 5/10 from me but this one horrible. A young family moves into a nice new house onlt to find out it's haunted and the dad goes crazy. They rip off alot of movies in this like The Shining and the original The Haunting. MGM also did a bad job on this disk for we get a trailer and that's all. I know alot of people like this movie because it's an older haunted house cheaply made movie
0, Don't waste your money: What a horrible movie! The movie starts out in a good direction
0, Dunno...: I finished the 60 day supply and didn't really notice any great benefits from it. It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water. Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after. Other than that
1, GET it and see.: If u dont get a good amount of greens & or probotics in your diet this product is for u.
1, Geen Vibrance-Awesome: I love this product! I mix it in with applejuice or put it in a smoothie. I've been using it for a couple of months now and I feel stronger
1, Wow
1, Best Green Powder You Can Buy: Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find. It's got everything in it! I mix it in my smoothie with emergen-c
1, Green Vibrance: This stuff is great. I mix it with juice at times and at times just with water. The effects are immediate and the energy is lasting. I mix a glass in the morning and at lunch.
0, taste awful: smell bad and taste awful. I could not sleep well at night after having this product after dinner. quit it.
1, Great: Deer Woman was my favorite of the two
1, Very tasty and fun...: The blues harp playing and the ambience of the whole album makes this much nicer than your average 1970's blues rock.
1, Gentle soul: John Coltrane / Soultrane (Prestige): A very good and enjoyable album. Not his best but one that will be played a lot. A very solid Four Star album.
1, Great!: Great album. Open Your Eyes was played on ER in May and I always have that song in my head. Chasing Cars is a great track as well!
0, Adolescent pop shlock: Could there be a more instantly forgettable group than Snow Patrol? I mean
0, awful: This is the most bland
1, An admirable effort
1, Got it on a whim
0, Bad DVD: I like Tom Petty but this DVD is bad. I have an HDTV set
1, Perfect Chill CD: Great CD for any ocassion! Chill
0, Find Ways to Supplement Your Studies: It's not a bad idea to include this book in your studies. Yes
0, Very Weak Study Guide: I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide. So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math
0, Read the Reviews: I've taken the test for the CSET multiple subject
1, Senior / Eldery Easy Sitting Exercise DVD: This seems to be just what my 75+ year old mother was looking for. She says she will use it more when the weather turns bad in the winter season and she can't get outside.
0, Awful: The format is silly and the exercises too simple. There will be no build up muscles with these few movements. Good only for someone who has been bed-bound for a year
0, To A Misled US Reviewer: Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising'
0, Not the Edition Pictured: The book I received was the 3rd edition not the 5th as pictured. The copy I received was in black and white. I was very disappointed.
1, Quilt In A Day: I loved this book. It is a most have for all quilters. The Log Cabin is the most versatile quilting pattern ever
0, Horrible
1, Kentucky series: Love Fern Michaels' books! This 3-book series was fantastic! I was loaned the 1st 2
1, smaller than I thought but very usable: I still think my kata dr 461 is better because of the added chest support strap and wider slimmer look but this will beat any shoulder bag. For long walks be it in the city or at a trail I am always looking for a small backpack to fill my needs. This little fellow was smaller than I thought but still I take it and put it to use for my backup dslr when I go out and about.
0, Another horrible remake: No insult to the lovely Jessica Alba but after viewing this
1, I can see clearly: Jessica Alba is perfect for this superb thriller. You really feel for her plight
1, Best Shoes: This it is one of the best products. I recommend it
0, horrible record!: So alright
1, The most informitive Hanson book!: I think it is a great book because I can read everything in the book
1, Hanson Biographies
1, Excellent!: The definitive guide to all that is Hanson. If you love their music
1, sketches of AFI: now that AFI has become an opverproduced studio crap-fest
1, Good solid Connector: I looked at a lot of cheap Chinese crap in Wally World before I decided to try this. I was fully prepared to send it back if it too seemed like junk; but it was not. It's a quality unit with good copper connectors inside that provide solid attachment inside.
1," Great Grip Spatula: This is a very versital spatula. I bought the spatula for the handle. The flexible rubber fins on the steel handle create a very comfortable feel and will NOT transport heat up the handle. The oversized grips create a very ""ergonomic"" feel and fits my hands without having to tightly grip the handle.The spoon head is very flexible and yet sturdy. It can be used to stir the stiffist pancake mix and yet still clean the side of the bowl smooth. It can also go from normal room temperatures to stirring the soup"
0, Big Disappointment!!!: I thought this one might be kind of cool
0, Good try but wait til they get more bugs out: If you liked Diablo or Dungeon Siege
0, If I could only play the game.......: So
1, Bought for my mom: My mom is older
1, Keep it plastic!: Brain plasticity is the key! This is great for adults
1, The Best in Mecha: This is much better than the other gundam series. Overall all of the gundam shows are the best mecha-type anime there is out there and has the best characters and the best action. I don't even like mecha that much
1, Great Item: I loved the plays in this collection of Noel Coward
1, 3/8 Flex Conduit: This is a great product if you have a small wiring job and need to protect the wire. It is a 25 foot roll of 3/8 flex conduit. It comes neatly packaged
0, The Worst Bellow Book?: The dialogue and endless introspection offered in this book gets tiresome quickly. Bellow's best work came before his Nobel Prize and this is an example of his weakening powers -- when his ideas outweighed action to create tedious novels.
0," Not what I thought they were ...: These are okay. My son ""tolerated"" them"
1, The Scratchless Wrench: This strap wrench replaced an old one that wore out and that I missed a lot.It grips items that cannot be gripped with other tools because there are noflat surfaces to grip or because gripping them would degrade the appearanceby marring or scratching the surfaces. It is ideal for fittings on faucetson sinks or bathtubs and any polished surfaces on pipes that need to begripped for turning.
1, Great Shoe: I have wide feet. They are true to size. I can even sleep in them. I walk and stand sometimes 12 hrs. This shoe is light weight and comfortable. I highly recommend this shoe to anyone that has had a problem in the past finding all day comfortable shoes.Shipping was good and they arrived just as pictured and stated. I am exceptionally happy with my purchase.
1, Third pair....: This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Romys I have owned( wore the first two pairs out). They are great for everyday use as well for long walks. They are light weight
0, Flimsy piece of junk: My daughter received this for a birthday gift and was thrilled when she saw the box. However
0, uplift teakettle: I was dissapointed in the color. Its listed as mock yellow
0, A whistling tea kettle which doesn't whistle.: I love OXO products except for this tea kettle. I -need- a kettle that whistles and this one doesn't. I burned up my first one of these and am now on my second. Both were gifts or I would have returned them. The steam comes out around the base of the spout.
1, careful!: These tea kettles are GREAT! But don't leave them on the stove with no water after the whistle stops working
0, Expensive / poor quality: Initially
0, Rusts inside!!!: Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle
0, Design Flaw: This teakettle has a design flaw. The handle on ours started to come loose within a month or so. It has to be retightened every week or it almost falls off. The loosening occurs at the spot where the handle is attached and by the uplift
0, Not Recommended: I like nothing about this kettle. The handle shifts unexpectedly which makes it awkward to move to a different burner and downright dangerous to pour. The instructions say to empty after use. It feels flimsy.
0, Poor quality
0, Worst teakettle we've ever had: When I try filling this thing with water
0, Tracy: This teakettle is the worst! After one week of use it's already rusting inside. The lid has cracked from the heat. I am very dissapointed. Don't purchase this one. Keep shopping for a different brand.
0, I could not use: I could not use because the CD is damaged
0, Mechanical Challenges: The form factor on this gem is fantastic! However
0, Very bad...: It worked for few months after that it is spoiled. Not working any more. I think it is very cheap (not in the price) product. I never recommend to anyone
0, Piece of Junk
0, Better Option: I bought this device thinking I would save money over buying multiple plug adapters for Germany and Australia... big mistake. I found that I could buy single plug adapters for each country for just $.99 each.
0, Not very small adapter: This adapter is certainly not small. It is large because it is an all-in-one
0, disappointed that it doesn't fit power outlets in INDIA: I have read a review that says this product also works in INDIA but came to know that neither of the given 4 different power plugs doesn't fit indian power outlets.
0, Did not work in the UK: Stayed at two hotels in the UK and this device did not work in either one. Would love to get a refund of this piece of junk. I have a number of other Kensington products
0, Does not work as advertised...or at all: As I have found it
1, Great Product: Great product
0, Supposedly for computers
0, travel plug adapter: I am going to France and needed an adapter for my appliances. After purchasing[ASIN:B0002H4YUI Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter]] I found it would not work without another purchase of a devise to change the voltage.
0, Wrong sizing and inconsistent sizing: I received two of these shirts of the same size. Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid.
1, A Very Fine Camera and Lens System: We purchased the camera just before leaving for a long vacation. Really wanted the 18-200 lens so I would only need to carry one lens. Shot just over 4
1, Great camera: I just moved up from a digital point and shoot
0, Timelapse recording: This camera has not timelapse recording!!!(Cameras with a time lapse feature can be programmed to automatically shoot a number of frames over a period of time or with a certain time interval between each frame. For instance
1, Superb energy of live hip hop performance: This is a completely new dimension of hip hop. For ones that haven't seen them perform live this is an unique experience. Definite must in every serious cd collection
1, The Country-fied Album: Great record. A good mix of songs and sounds. With 23 tracks
1, DogRead Book of the Month: DogRead book of the month July
0, I wouldn't waste my money: I enjoyed reading it
1, LOVE THIS CD!: THIS CD IS BEAUTIFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING IN A GENTLE MANNER
1, Awesome Job!: This CD is the best I have heard in a long time. I listen to it every day at least three or four times. I just wanted to tell everyone that they should get this CD even if they don't think they would like it... like I did. After you hear it once
0, Would give no stars if it were an option: After using only a few times
0, Amazingly bad: Planned a road trip just for the purpose of listening to this box set... just as I had done for the great 70s and 80s Rhino boxes. I cannot believe how bad this is - particularly how unrepresentative of the decade it is. PLEASE Rhino - try again.
1, great album: this is probably my favorite vu record. the band's songs are more melodic and less experimental noiscapes that characterized the content of their first two records. the modern lover's first album is very influenced by the vu music recorded in this era. i like the vu's music from this period.
1, A Small Point: I have just a small point to add to what's been said. In my humble opinion
1, The clamps work
0, Grizzly
0, Great Clamp - High Shipping: Clamps are great. Small issues with a few but nothing unexpected. That is until you realize that the standard shipping alone is more than the product cost. $7.70 to standard ship a $6.99 product?This bear bites!! READ THE FINE PRINT FIRST.....
0, Not worth your time: B and low budget horror is typically my favorite genre. A movie can be a great movie despite its budget; any movie
0," 0 STARS: HORRIBLE!!!: ""Witchhouse"" is an artificial low-budget supposedly horror-comedy hybrid (plenty of unintentional comedy but zero horror) which is truly lame and totally ridiculous. In the mold of ""Night Of The Demons"""
0, it SUCKS: I rented this movie just last week
0, Given as a post hospital gift: My mother and father found it to difficult to use. In their eighties I thought it would keep all of mom's medications lined up but tey were unhappy and went back to doling out their pills from each bottle when they needed to be taken.
0, Poor Quality: Poor quality
0, Not good quality: This is very cheaply made. Two of the doors on the compartments were nearly broken off upon arrival. The other compartment doors are not secure
0, Don't bother buying it!: this dough blender is pretty useless. the wires are not reinforced which makes cutting cold butter into the flour almost impossible and very time-consuming. you're better off just using two knives or your fingers than this dough blender
0," glad I came here first!: I was going to take my young kids to see this ""family"" movie. I was checking the showtimes and saw it was PG-13! I thought I'd better check it out. Now I hear that the coach is inside Hooters and singing ""Cocaine"""
0, Poor language & equally poor message: This movie is a far cry from the original.I lost track of how many times the kids and adults in this film swore gratuitiously. Worse yet
1, It is one of the greatest games for gameboy advance!: It has groovy tunes
1, pretty good: I have always loved this band
1, WE LOVE DORA AND BOOTS!!!: My 3yr old girls LOVE this product! This is something they actually play together! And that doesn't happen unless they are being mischievous. Even my son who is 6 also plays the games and likes it. It has the real voices from the show and all the familiar characters they know. It teaches simple spanish words that my girls love repeating through out their busy day. I would recommend this to any Dora fan.
0, Can't believe I bought this: One word for this cd: HORRIBLE. I tried to listen to this four times and hated it more with each play. I can't begin to tell you how awful this cd is. I was reading the 5 star reviews on here with bewilderment. Then one of these reviews calls this 'the anti- Beatles' and this person goes on to say the Beatles are hated. It makes sense now. If you hate great music
1, Great for small jobs: I use this for small jobs that I don't want to get a hand mixer our for. I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon
1, A MOST PROMISING NEW TALENT: Karrin Allyson has everything to become very quickly a singer extraordinaire: the voice
0, Hated the Movie
0, Save your money: This movies is SO BAD
0, DVD looks videoy... Not theatrical version: While the film itself is excellent
1, Job Boss Compressor Review: This compressor has delivered in all of the areas I expected. It is very portable and easy to use. CFM output is very adequate for small jobs or larger demands for short periods of time. My only disappointment was with the handle assembly. I feel that it should be more secure with some sort of locking mechanism.
1, Great clean-up tool: I have to admit - I actually just use this scraper as a scraper -- cleaning up the counter tops after cooking/baking/rolling
1, Worth it.: It's so useful. I use it for shoveling off the cutting board into the pan mostly
0, Quality problems: I purchased a few of these for myself and friends. From the day I got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool
0, oxo needs to use the tools they sell.: I like the fact that the spoon doesn't stain that is great
0, Waste of Money!: It might work on wooden Cork's but it does not work on Plastic corks for Champagne. Waste of money!
1, Nostalgiatopia: Take a walk down memory lane with this handbook on how to survive in the great outdoors. You'll learn how to dig out a canoe
0, Not what I was expecting.: I was really disappointed in this title.... It was written in 1890 and it's totally outdated. As an interesting browse in the library or book store
1, After Boy in a man's world great follow up!: I have to say this album not only took me by surprise but made me like this band even more because Boy in man's world was just a little predictable and simply written
1, It works.: It works okay but it is a little awkward to use at times. On occasion you have to tilt the blower to actually aim at the leaves etc. you are trying to move
0, Came damaged but is also cheap: I was disappointed with this product. The tab is broken on one of the days
1, Cool idea!: I Like it... Definitely allows me to keep track of my meds intake. But it would have been better if the am/pm slots had separate openings. Besides that
1, Cheap but neat little tripod: Tripod is a nice size to carry with you and use on the hood of a car or any flat surface
1, Great purchase!: I love this whisk! It is comfortable
0, Genocide
0, Unfortunate boring mediocrity: As a huge Circle Jerks fan
1," Accurate Translation of the Quran: It is essential that everyone become familiar with the fastest growing and most dangerous religion in the world. Other than the fact that this translation replaces ""Allah"" with ""God"" to make it more palatable for the less enlightened"
0, truly awful transaltion!: Now
0, horrible translation: i am a muslim myself. I have read the 'real' Koran several times and have much of it memorized. Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated
1," Surprise: I was surprised by this movie. This can be labelled a ""Black comedy"
1, Appealing to my sense of spirituality
0, regalo could make a better bedrail: I am not crazy about this bedrail at all. I bought it for co-sleeping with our 6 month old. It was difficult to put together as the directions were horribly written and the illustrations left a lot to the imagination. When I finally got it together and put it in the bed the latch for the rope that holds the rail to the bed broke. I still tried to use it that night and i could feel the rails under the mattress as they are really thick. I returned this one and bought one that doesn't hideaway and includes a blocker for the baby to not roll between the mattress and rail - this one leaves a sizeable gap for baby to roll into.
1, Hard to find classic !!: Crumbsuckers first album is very hard to find and is a true classic 
1, Great Racquetball Glove: This racquet had been great preventing the racquet from slipping in my hand.I usually wear out the glove in high friction areas before palm grip wears out.
1, Works well for whatever sifter needs you have: Works well for a sifter of flour and such. However
0, disappointed: This is the only product that I have ever ordered from Amazon that I have been disappointed with. It is very small (I looked and looked for a size in the details and could not find one) and you just move the handle side to side to sift and it takes forever! Will not use again.
0, Way too slow
0, Too Slow
0, Horrible Product: I bought this item and tried several different powdered products in it and after 5 min of shaking
0, This new design just doesn't work: OXO products are known for innovative design. I have the can opener
0, slow and tedious...: I like OXO products for the most part

1, Whispered Promises: It does not matter if you are male or female as long as you are a Madaris
0, Audio is terrible: This is VHS to DVD creation that has horrible audio quality. I wouldn't pay more than what I did for this thing (2 dollars).
1, pretty good: this is a good CD....nice
0, What the...?: I listened to this CD because someone recommended it and let me borrow it. I absoloutly hated it. I'm sorry but it's just bad music. They do not need 7 people in a band because only one or two of them actually sing. The rest are reduced to singing choir and back up voices. I have no idea why my friend likes it so much because I absoloutly could not stand it. They are all cheesy toons that sound like something out of disney or something. The minute I put this CD in my player and listened to one song I HAD to turn it off!! If you like bubble gum pop poster bands then you might like it...that is if you're also a fan of one hit wonders...
1, S Club 7 ROCK!: This CD is AWSOME! When you listen to it then you wanna turn up the sound as loud as it goes and boogy! And you don't wanna turn it off! Also this groop doesn't sing about sex. I got this CD because I had heard all the song off of the show. On channel 31. I also love the show. S Club 7 ROCKS!
1, SClub7 CD: While Sclub7 is not profound music
1, Exceptionally insightful presentation of phenomenology: For anyone versed in realistic philosophy (Aristotelian/Thomistic)this book by Robert Sokolowski should both broaden and deepen their understanding of the basics of first philosophy as well as its very meaning. Sokolowski's presentation of phenomenology is challenging but clear. I certainly recommend the book.Introduction to Phenomenology
1, Introduction to phenomenology: This book will be just great for introducing my master degree students on very important concepts on Phenomenology
0, My worst book investment till now: If you expect something like Pit Bull

0, Damaged book! Supposed to be perfect!: I ordered this book BRAND NEW
0, Tedious: The metaphors are too obscure
1, Best Movie Mag Around: If you are a movie fan looking for a read this is the magazine. Empire's strength is in treading a line between in-depth-analysis and shallow commercial puffs. In other words
1, A Womans tale: I really enjoyed this book. The story is definetly written from a womans point of view and I was able to relate quite well. I highly recomend this story as the tale of a moment in time as seen through a womans eyes in Central America.
1, forged note: I am a student of Oscar Micheaux films and literature. Oscar Micheaux was a man of limited educational accomplishment[8th]grade. He was opinionated and wrote what he felt about afro-americans
0," Where's Florida: We drive I-95 from NY to Florida about four times a year. We use mostly our GPS for speed and routes. I also have and use the ""I-95 Exit Information Guide"" (from Maine to Florida)which is a great book and it sits right next to me. This ""Drive I-95"" was very disappointing to me. The information in it is seven years old"
0, Yawn: I was so excited to order this book. I guess I expected more of a guide book than it is. You do get listings of what is at each exit to the Florida border on 95- but I was hoping for some reviews(especially on the many many hotels along 95) The most info given on a hotel is if it serves scrambled eggs for breakfast-not if it was clean-or what services it has. Mobil travel guide would have been a better choice for me. Also it reads a little off. The maps in the front representing your trip down to Florida run from the bottom of the page- up(vs going from top down as you are driving) I found this slightly annoying. On the plus side

1," No surprises here: Easy to assembleLarge enough for a 100 lb boxer/mastiff mixI leave my pooch in the garage with access to the backyard during the work days. This kennel gives him nice cozy place to curl up on those cold days in the NW. I placed an outdoor heating pad on the bottom and i covered the top and sides with an old rug to provide some ""insulation."" He appears to like it just fine.If you need to move the kennel around"
1," A celebration of Victorian values: H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" is at once a ripping adventure yarn and a celebration of Victorian values. The book - the first of the ""Lost World"" genre - features at trio of English adventurers: the elephant hunter Allan Quatermain"

0, nice trainers........: the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they haven't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves. I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it.....and am just about to start the process all over again.....if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience.....second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - don't know whether i'll get the $116 (not including the purchase price which has been refunded now) that i am owed.....i think thats down to amazon....fingers crossed i guess

1, Great book: Awesome book
0, Not Fun: This game is not much fun. I wouldn't recommend it. The rest of my family didn't like it either. There are 3 ways to answer the questions but only one way really works.
1, Tanx: Not Bolan's best
1, Changes your perspective...: I first recieved the book DAVID as a young child... too young maybe. I read the book from start to finish
1, Perfect size!: This skimmer is large enough to use in my deep fryer and fits well in most of my pots and pans. I like this much better than the concentric circle design of other skimmers which don't work well with many foods. This skimmer has wholes to let liquid go through without losing the food you are straining.
0, Not as good as it could have been: Given the positive reviews
1, Much better than I expected: It's not a traditional Stoker vampire story but it's still not bad. after a couple of chapters it became a real page turner. It really is an entertaining read. I don't think anyone is going to say this is the their all time horror/vampire novel but it does what it sets out to do.
0, Caution: Sail only in pool or bathtub!: Exercise caution with this sailboat; I sailed two on a lake nearby ... both took on water (i.e. leaked) when heeled over which is what sailboats are supposed to do. The result was one boat sunk with no chance of recovery
0, Not very fun: My baby boy never liked this. It was a gift and he was never remotely interested. Other toys can be hung or attached and swatted at. This just sits there and to me was pointless. Go with something more fun.
0, Very disappointing: I received Charlie as a gift for my baby
0, Very good acting in a very bad cause...: The idea that mathematical genius is somehow strange or crazyis very bad doctrine. People with power of innovation and originalthought are produced in the gene pool with regularity.They are almost as likely to be found among the pooras among the wealthy.Much of the real advancement of civilizations has depended on thembraving misunderstanding and persecution to bring their ideas forward.Contributing to their problems as this movie does

0, Too bulky; too weak: I have always liked Oxo
0, Bad Measures: I tried to review these at Macy's where I bought them from after following a link here but they don't allow bad reviews on their site. If it's bad - they time you out and won't let it post. Since I started here I'll review here. I didn't get a chance to check the handle issue. I checked them for accuracy because the 1 cup just didn't look quite right. I was correct. It is off in measure nearly 1/8 of a cup! I checked it against Pyrex

1, GREAT BOOK....: My five year old son loves trains and all the thomas books. This product is an excellent book
1, Beautiful Book: This was bought as a gift for a 9 year old boy. This story lets him know that not everyone is the same or should they be.
1, one of the best: Lois Lowry is a great writer. Its a book you dont want to put down. If you think that the world we live in is bad you should read The Giver
1, A Realistic Utopia: This book sets the stage for a utopian society
1, An appropriately thought-provoking read for any age: The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance
1, A look at what could happen to our world.: I had heard about this book for years but I had never read it. People always talked about it like it was a forbidden fruit or a masterpiece. The question always was
1," The Giver: The book ""The Giver"" takes place in a strange community some time in the Future.Jonas is closing in on his ceremony of Twelve"
0," Rewiew of ""The Giver"": ""The Giver"" is a novel which deals with the problems boy named Jonas who lives in a totalitarian system.I this system"
1, a truely wonderful book...: I recently read The Giver and i thought it was a wonderful book. I liked it because it was truley original and really made you think about things you might never have thought about before. Like
0, Just ok: This book
1, The greatest novel: Jonas lives in a perfect society. No pain
1, The Giver: This book really made me think about the views on the future and how incredably imposible having a perfect world would be. The beginning of this book really opened my eyes to the exact set up Lois Lowry describes the future to be like. It made me think of how things would be if the world were completely orgagnized. But 12 year old Jonas had to take on the memory of the world
1, Review for The Giver ( i guess uh.... one thumb up?): This is a pretty good book. Our class of 7SR just finished it. i think Lois Lowry should write a sequel
1, You either like it or you don't
0, Giver: I did not like this book very much because well it did not makesence to me because well it was not a good book. I would not reccomendit to anyone no matter what because well i think they will not like it. I did not like the ending it just ended and it did not make sence to me. I liked how they decribed the community and how they decribed the memories Jonas recived and the memories Giver had of his past and other things like that. I liked Asher Jonas's bestfriend and Fioena too and i liked how they decribed Gabe in the book and how they decribed Gabes eyes how Gabe looked a little like Jonas. The other characters in the book were Lilly and mother and father and the old people that Jonas knew and the commity of elders and every one that he knew.
1, Interesting point of view...: I am a 30's something female just starting to read Lois Lowry again. This book gripped me and I could not put it down. It is so far fetched from society that I wanted to know what happened next. It is a neat story and I really enjoyed it. I did not like the way it ended
0, The second chapter: Hello ladys and gentleman
0, DON'T READ THE GIVER: IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES. THE ENDING IS SO WEIRD. THE BOOK MAKES YOU THINK TOO HARD. IT IS BAD.
1, THE GIVER: Jonas is a kid who lives in the perfect world
0, Not enough Detail: Really most people would like this book
0, THIS IS SICK!: THIS BOOK IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT ANY CHILD SHOULD BE READING! I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO MY CHILD'S SCHOOL ABOUT THIS AND I PRAY THAT PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THIS BEFORE THEY LET THEIR CHILD READ IT! CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS' FATHER KILLED A BABY. THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TRASH AND THEN WE GIVE THIS BOOK TO OUR KIDS TO READ FOR A GRADE! IF YOU THINK THIS BOOK IS GOOD
1, The Giver is about a different kind of community.: The Giver is a uniquely written book that is full of allusion and suspense in a twisted way. It is very touching in the fact that it opens your eyes to a community that shows equality for all. On the other hand
1, The Best: This book was amazing
1, I Enjoyed This: Someone gave me this book after I told them how much I loved 'The Hunger Games.' It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World
1," To recomend or not to recomend ""The Giver"" that is the ?: Many people have read The Giver and have many thoughts regarding the book. Some would say that the novel interested them and kept them want to read. Many of the people that have read the book have written to the author which is"
1, An Outstanding Book: Not being an avid reader
1," The Giver: ""The Giver"" is a story written by Lois Lowry that conveys what human life would be like if no thought or feelings were involved. Life just goes on as normal with people never asking any questions on why such activities are done the way they are in the town. The story begins to pick up when Jonas is selected as to be the Receiver of town (the most respected position). As this happens"
1, Very good book: I read this book to preview it before gifting it to my 12 year old nephew. I wanted to make sure it is appropriate for his age. I did not expect to get sucked into the story as much as I did. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only complaint is that the ending was rather abrupt and didn't really leave me with any sense of resolution.
1, thought-provoking: The Giver is written in a unique style that gives much for the imagination to ponder. Lowry's descriptions are vague as well as the ending. However
1," Surface and Symbol: From Oscar Wilde's Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray: ""Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.""A good pick for readers at both the middle-school level and the high school level"
1, This is a Great book.: I have read this book over and over agian because it will never be old. I read this book in the sixth grade and after we read it i knew i had to get my own copy. It was so good that used to be all i read until i read Lois Lowery's Gathering Blue. In my opinion everyone should own this book. It is the best book i have read and own. I recomend it to anyone.
1, Excellent Read: Very enjoyable book fast paced and interesting well written
1, A book for the mind.: I read this book when I was in 7th grade and loved it! It's only my 2nd favorite
1, Very quick and great read.: This is probably one of the books that I read through the fastest. It kept me interested throughout and was difficult to put down. This is one of the first books to ever make me keep reading so I could find out what happens next. I told myself I was only going to read one more chapter and ended up reading three more before going to bed. One of the great things about this book is that it is very short and very easy to read. This isn't one of my favorite books I have ever read but it was very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it.
0, The Giver: This is a creepy
0," The Giver: I do not think the book ""The Giver"" was a good book. I do not like how the community was controlled. The book takes place in the future but there technology is not any more advanced than today.It was odd how they released the elderly and the newborns.It was heartless how they released people.I thought it was wrong. It was a somewhat interesting book but I DO NOT recommend it."
0, How sad: My step daughter had to read this book for school. How sad that we give medals to books that have no message other than that of a liberal perfect world. I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way. My wife and I read the book and can't believe that there isnt't a more positive book that the schools can promote. How sad.
1," good review: I gave this book 4 stars because of all the parts that I thought were the best parts in this book. I really recommend this book for people because of there was the best climax at the right moment in this book. I disliked that in this book everyone got there real jobs at only 12 years old. I also disliked the fact that people get ""released"" because I think they should have the elder people go threw old age without having to die early. At the end of the book Jonas and his little sister had escaped from the community and I thought that would be a good part in the book because they found out what it means to be released and they didn't want to be part of the community anymore so they had escaped."
1, Incredible!: This is a really thought provoking book
1, A Tale of Secret Memories: In a community where people know nothing about real life
1," The Giver - a book to remember: I think that ""The Giver"" was a very good book. It was well written and had a good meaning. In this book"
0," Read ""1984"" instead: Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984"
1, Cliffhanger: I loved this book! It was slightly creepy at some parts
1, KB Pope John XXIII: When I first began the Giver
1," The Giver: I liked ""The Giver"""
1," Engrossing!: I recently read this book for my middle school library college class and was completely engrossed! In high school my favorite book that the school made us read was 1984 and The Giver was very similiar.I remember when this book came out and I saw the cover and thought it was a ""boys book."" I didn't know what the big fuss was about and didn't want to read a book about an old man. I wish that I had looked past the cover and read then because I LOVED this book."
1, The Giver-Ending?What Ending?: The Giver was a good book. When Jonas became Receiver
1, Engrossing: Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion
0," ok: The shipping was amazingly fast. However the book was listed as regular paperback and it was a mass market paperback. Also the pages are all so yellowed it's hard to read. Not what I would have called ""good condition."""
1, A wonderful book deserving of its award!: I rented the audiocassette to take on an 8 hour car trip. My husband and 11 year old son complained about having to listen to it--but were both saddened when it came to an end and wanted explanations! My 13 year old daughter and I loved it. I was so touched by Jonas strength and compassion for Gabe and I was so impressed by the ending of this story. I like it when the author leaves part of the story for the reader to figure out and think about. It is a sign of a good book if you have to actually go inside yourself for some of the answers.I thought about this book for days and was thorougly impressed with this newberry award winner.
1, Award winning book: An award winning book is a great thing to read. Have been meening to read this for quite a while.
1, The Giver: Lois Lowry does a wonderful job creating a futuristic/utopian society. There is one person chosen in the society that has to hold all of the memories from the past. The chosen one is a 12 year old boy named Jonas. Once the Giver has successfully passed on all of the memories
1, Great book for young adults teens 13-19: This book has the feeling to get into your mind of what it is mlike to die
0, The Giver : A Weak Attempt at Allegory (with a Bad Ending): The book was tollerable and even enjoyable until the conclusion. The book falls apart at the end. If you want a true
1, Great book: I really liked this book. It is thought provoking and a great book for a book club to read. Generates lots of discussion!
0, Doesn't make any sense!!!: I've read this book
0, Not this Seaford Deader's favorite book: The Giver was an odd book. The beginning was terrible but the middle and most of the end was interesting at times. At the end of each chapter something happened that made you want to read more. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who likes lots of action and thrills
1, The Giver is a great book!: I rated this book a four star becease for me it is not perfect
1, The Giver: WOW! I couldn't put this book down! When I was finished reading it
1," The Giver: This book should be a ""must read"" for every young person particularly those whose life"
1, Hey!: Hey! look over here ok now that I've got your attention
1, My Son Loved this Book!: My middle schooler had to read this book for class
1, The Giver: As a book of fiction The Giver is great. I find that because it shows you to be careful what you wish for. In The Giver the characters can't see any color or are unable to hear music. They have no freedom of choice in their world. All because some one made a wish and it came true. The part that effected me the most is reading about Jonas because he was the receiver of everyone's memories. He ends up receiving all their pain
0," Another Rom stereotype: One illustration in this otherwise innocent tale clearly depicts Gypsies as ""wood people"" who"
0," I WANT MY MONEY BACK: I thought this book would tell me something I didn't know. It didn't. I thought it would be interesting enough to keep me awake and wanting to read it. It wasn't. I thought Bruce Schnier was a big thinker and agressive. He isn't; he's overly cautious and careful with his words out of his own ""fear"" of insulting somebody. I thought he would take a stand on the issues. He didn't. I thought he understood security in the post-9/11 world. He doesn't. In fact"
1, Blast from the past: This is a classic 1980's video. It was great when it came out
1, An 80's Classic!!!: I've always loved time travel movies
1, Dudes! You Guys Are Going Back in Time With This Movie.: If you want to see a funny time machine movie
1, Excellent!: Eighties movies do NOT get any better than Bill and Ted! This movie rocks in all concieveable ways
1, Will last for months: Yep
1, good quality product typical of OXO: This is a really nice set of measuring spoons. They are aesthetically pleasing
1, Good features
0, Not worth it
1, Great measuring spoon set: I bought these for my sister as a Christmas gift. I liked that the set included 6 spoons (including the 1/8 tsp).
0, Labels rub off very quickly
1, Lil LOVES Lotty!: Santa brought our (then) 5 month old Lotty for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES Lotty! The antennae must be magical because that's the first thing she reached for and of course put in her mouth. Even when she's fussy
0, Much ado about nothing: Marina loves Sebastian - no
0, WORST soundtrack ever: this has to be the worst soundtrack ever. most of mtv's soundtracks aren't very good
1, a good turner: My husband likes it. We have no complaint about it. I think it will last very long time. It's a good quality turner.
1, Spatula that you'll adore.: Another fine product by Oxo Good Grips. Good value for a sturdy spatula that will not bend out of shape. Love the comfy grip too.
1, Turner: Perfect size and weight
1, Sad
1, Chekov ... photon torpedoes fire!: The beginning of the Third Season was really good. This episode is no exception. The battle scene was one of the series finest. You then have Kirk and Elaan ending their fling in order to do their duties and responsibilities. This is a nice little episode.
1, Love
1, An inspiring album from an inspiring man. . .: Andrea Bocelli is not and never will be Pavarotti
0, Very Traditional Roman Catholic renditions of religious arias.: This is a VERY traditional Roman Catholic CD
1," He is getting better with each recording.: Bocelli shows his spritual side in this CD. The work is different here than on ""SOGNO and ""ROMANZA"""
1, Pretty good: Pretty good book to learn from. Well laid out. Some areas could be clearer
1, A good first book about scalable applications: This book covers all the process to make a scalable application in .net world. It explains all about software and hardware issues. It is written in a easy English and the examples are in VB.net (I had preferred in C#). It covers lots of things in .net: objects
1, A good book to have.: A realize early that the book has potential.The content of the chapters are of high quality
0, EDITION IS PROBLEMATIC: While the product arrived on time and in excellent condition the actual edition of the book is a terrible choice. Not only were there an outrageous amount of typos but some of the pages were actual reprints of previous pages. This made it a difficult text to read.
1, A most enjoyable reading experience: I've been reading some of the Cather books and have enjoyed all of them. The best part of this book is her story within a story technique. Her descriptions of the American southwest are outstanding. This book held my attention
1, good: muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
1, I like all of the Clarks shoes I have ever worn.: I ordered this as a replacement for a pair I wore out. It took me several years to go through the first pair. These feel good but may not be as sturdy as my old ones. I'm going to give them a few miles test walk then may go up to the 5 stars.
1, la marca lo dice todo: son excelentes
1," A superb reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars.: This band certainly appears to be a reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars (it features most of the legendary musicians who were key players in the 1960s Allegre sessions). Featuring the late great sonero Chivirico Davila and Paquito Guzman on vocals with a killer rhythm section this is smokin' classic ""Salsa Dura"" at its glorious best. Buy this CD now if you are a fan of 1960s and '70s Salsa. You'll love it!!!"
0, Two units
1," UNADULTERATED SOUL AT IT'S BEST!: THIS IS A ""MUST HAVE"" CD FOR EVERY STYLISTICS FAN. MY FAVORITE TRACKS INCLUDE COULD THIS BE THE END"
1, Morning Magic: I include Royal Jelly in my morning protein shake. This supplement provides a subtle boost to my energy
0, Useless Fork: If someone could please tell what this is useful for
1, Always good: Second season of NCIS LA is as good as the first one.As we already liked very much NCIS (very big success in France
1, Grim Reality plus Historical Accuracy: The boxed set related to us everything we ever wanted to know about the Mafia. Unlike The Godfather
0, great show
1, good spaghetti server: the item arrived quickly and was well packaged. The item appears very sturdy and i expect it will last a long time
0, Oh well...: i should of listened. i would give the free ride a 2 out of 5 and the story mode a 3 1/2. its not as good as i expected. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! especially if your a kid who rarely gets money and rarely buys games. save your money and reserve a copy of grand theft auto san andreas. Never before have i ever been more anxious about a game more than grand theft auto and it has always been as good as i expected. read more about my review on grand theft auto san andreas titled i cant wait by jacob from somewhere.
0, No coupons included (as author suggested) and weak info
0, Follow at your peril: This is an entertaining read and almost certainly the most comprehensive work on the subject. But the fundamental premise (basically: the casinos will do anything to screw you out of your money
1, Great game: It arrived as described and i haven't had any issues with it. I would recommend this item to anyone without hesitation.
1, This is simply a wonderful album: The quality of the songwriting on this album is just breathtaking
1, review: product was fine. HOWEVER I will not buy from this vendor again as bought 2 cds
0, Tai chi beginning practice
0, Tai chi: I found it very hard to follow as he does not turn away from you. I will try it again but now I would not recommend it to others
0, I find this presenter hard to follow.: I have several T'ai Chi dvds and truly enjoy the practice. I found this presenter hard to follow
1, An excellent introduction to tai chi: After reading some of the more negative reviews I just want to point out that this DVD is not meant for you to build your tai chi vocabulary. Instead it's aim is to focus you on the basics of tai chi
0, Audio missing. Please fix.: Audio missing. Please fix. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Mary had a little lamb.Jack be nimble jack be quick.
1, Very good for fans of instrumental rock: This is a good band from Holland that is a footnote in the history of late 60s - early 70s rock and roll. Only one song
1, pretty short but nice read: It gives another look at shrooms and growing them. It's pretty nice how the meaning is described; and the illustrations on the cover are pretty trippy on their own.
0, well for begin: it's a good book for people who want to know the simplest method for growing the mushrooms. it's only dedicate to Stropharia cubensis.
0, OUT OF DATE N A RIP OFF: I purchased this item and to my surprise it was horrible. All the hype associated with it. Then when trying to get a refund because the item was so out of date I got nothing back. It is a rip off folks. Most of the information on this is incorrect. The websites dont exist and half the clubs listed in the venues directory have been closed to date. This book is close to 3 years old and is tauted as being updated. It is not true. Save your money and find other means....
0, COME ON...Forty BUCKS?!?!?: There's little more to say....great item
0, Canon Lens Hood EW83E: It's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens
1, Works like a charm!: We do not have pie very often
0, what: wow 5 episodes? and the packaging.. isnt even the same as the first season.. why are they shorting us with these?i couldnt imagine the 2nd season actually being only 5 episodes.
0, Not particularly interesting: eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. Collection of short stories featuring mostly family events.While some of the stories had mildly amusing endings
1, Watch the wiring: The plug was exactly what I wanted. BUT
0, Sad!: I'm so sad about this book. I was really looking forward to reading it. However
0, Pointless: A mix of past history
0, George Soros' wet dream: I love several of HG Wells novels. The First Men in the Moon
1, CHEVERISIMA: ESTA CAMISA AL IGUAL QUE OTRA CAMISA QUE ME LAS TRAJE
0, not even worth the shipping: I used this out in the back yard to create a nice shady spot for my 6 month old. One little whisper of wind
1, Excellent!!!!: buy this tent for my son and loved it
0, All that glitters isn't gold: I bought this to go to the beach
0, Disappointed: After reading many reviews I chose this tent to bring to the beach for my 7 month old. After putting it up there was no way I'd put my daughter in there. There was no air inside the tent and it was so hot inside I probably could have fried an egg. This tent was definitely not made for hot days at the beach!
1, Great Indoor Tent: We got this tent for our daughters
1, Just stating the obvious: In my honest opinion
1, Not the Best Jet Li
0, Rent
0, grade A bullflop: The Only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because there is no option to give it none. I beg you
1, The One: This film shows Jet Li at his best. Playing duo roles and playing them so real is truly amazing. Jason Statham is also in this one so it is a double treat for me.
0, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR PETS!!!: This product contains CORN SYRUP. I have been adding glucosamine to my dog's food for the past three years and never before have I purchased a product containing corn syrup. I avoid this unnecessary additive in my own food
0, Could be Much Better: I am the happy owner of a Kitchenaid stand mixer and food processor (they work perfectly). I bought this item based on my usual terrific experience with Kitchenaid - WRONG. Though its clean-up is a breeze (its dishwasher safe)
0, effective
1, NCIS eighth season: It appeared to be more complex and held my attention better. Tony seemed to mature a little and after all these years he should get rid of some of the nonsense. Overall I liked it very much.
1, Best series on TV: I have all eight seasons and have enjoyed them several times. By owning the DVDs you don't have to watch the commercials. The bonus features is also a plus.
1, ncis: This was the perfect Christmas present for my nephew.he is thrilled with gift which makes me thrilled to have got it
1, NCIS Season 5-8: Ordered NCIS seasons 5-8 and was very happy. Seasons 5-7 arrived unblimished and very fast. Season 8 arrived two days earlier than expected. I am VERY happy with the items and thankful that they arrived in pristine condition. Recommend all for anyone looking to complete thier set.
1, No set is complete without it: My wife couldn't wait to open this up and watch the past episodes again
0, You'll learn Flash alright....but it'll bore you to death!!: It's very educational but the contents...yuck. I want a book to INSPIRE me to USE the program i'm learning
0," Dino Thunder Sleeping Bag: My son loved the idea of a sleeping bag but it's not very comfortable. The fabric is very slippery on the outside and sticky on the inside. His pajamas stick to the fabric when he tries to roll over and the whole thing twists around him. He likes to play in it but not sleep in it. A good ""toy"" but not very practical."
0, learning remote: good product
0, very boomy: not a quality piece. i usually like KLH products
1, Good product: This is my first coffee grinder; it works very quickly and cleans up easily. I like that it's dishwasher-safe!To agree with a previous reviewer - I also grind beans for less than the recommended time.
1, KitchenAid Coffee Grinder Eval: After wearing out several low cost units by makers
1, Works Great: I have the Cobalt Blue i bought 3 years ago and use for spices. It does a great job on pepper and other whole spices like allspice. Yes it does overflow the rim but like someone said just invert before opening and everything will fall into the over sized plastic cap. Since it's stainless you can grind spices
0, Mess Maker: My wife must have nearly one of every red Kitchen Aid products. All function will and are built to last. But the only one to make a bigger mess on my counter is the stand mixer when it has too much flour and is run on high. I grind 1/4c. beans and it escapes either during the grind if I don't have the lid fully pressed or when I release the lid. This beauty is built to last and does look good on the counter. My last Starbucks grinder failed because of a frayed cord(from wrappping around the cylinder). The Kitchen Aid grinder has a high quality cord like my Porter Cable tools. Unfortunately it will last forever. Messy
0," un- kitchen aid: Got this today and reviewer who said ""coffee grinds all over counter "" is correct. Even under the first line for fill guidelines; less than 4 cups; I had grinds on the counter and on the side of the unit. Also"
1, Very pleased....so far.: Very pleased thus far. Ability to wash grinding parts was the deciding factor in choosing this over other makes. The only reason I am only giving four (4) stars is that I have had it less than one month and cannot comment on its durability.
1, Edited From the LP: As I see it
1, Gutsy book: This is a gutsy book by a gutsy woman. As C. Everett Koop
1, Very good but not great: Based on the blink-182 pedigree of the band's key members
0, Expected More: I was so excited to receive this video. I NEVER buy videos because I'm not one to watch them over and over however
1, Under the sea: Great dvd. Bought it for my 4 year old who watches it over and over. It is fast paced enough to keep him interested but calming at the same time.
0, Didn't get to watch it.: We weren't able to watch it
0," Shady practices - seller abundatrade: Purchased this ""combo"". The seller (abundatrade) only shipped the 3D version and covered-up the UPC area where the manufacturer had printed ""NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE"". I assume this is because the discs were part of a combo pack as is the case with other combos I have purchased. Buyer beware when purchasing from this merchant."
1, Scarecrow Love Bites Fangs: These fangs are great! I got these small ones and they were almost too big for my teeth but they looked better after I molded them. They were easy to customize and stay on wonderfully. I would highly recommend these
1, many compliments: I was a vampire this year and decided to try the individual fangs like my friend had back in highschool. The night of Halloween
1, Beautiful!: It looks JUST like the one in the movie! Absolutely beautiful! I wear mine almost every day. I get so many compliments! It's not too big or too small. I havent had a bit of problems with it and I'm so glad I purchased this ring.
0, One reason to buy this CD.: This is Hawaiian music done very well. Darnall is a master arranger and player of string instruments. Most songs could be background music. However! Over the Rainbow is pure genius. Unforgettable. I would use the word
1," Life Support: A great ""page turner"" that kept me up all night to see the end. I enjoy all of Tess Gerritsen's work!"
1, Good Book- Medical Thriller: I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. Toby was a good main character to the problems that were faced in the ER. It was interesting how dr. carl wallenberg was opposing her so much of the time! To find out more
0, Not as good as I thought it would be.: I first read Tess Gerritsen's book 'The Surgeon' and loved it
1, if you like....: If you like her others
1, Be prepared...: This book is hard to read. Ever seen the movie 'The Blue Lagoon'? Especially late at night? It left me with a hollow feeling
1, One of the best tapes ever from DBZ: In this tape we see Trunks power up to a level of Super Saiyan that surpasses his father and CELL! Even though the power slows him down he manages to put up A good fight until he realizes that his power is slowing him down. We also see Goku and Gohan training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber as Super Saiyans. We see Goku power up to SS2. In the episode Ghosts From Tomorrow we see the violent deaths of all the Z Fighters. I rate the Video 4 out 5 because there is just a lot of standing around. I hope this review helps all those DBZ fans out there.
1, The Amazing Review of The Ferguson Rifle by Chris Bullock: The Ferguson Rifle is a really good book..It tells of the life and hardships the frontiersmen faced out on the lawless great plains.The main character
1, Love this book...: Arrived quickly & in the described condition (hey
0, Already included with 7-speed mixer: Works fine but don't buy this if you buy the seven-speed mixer. It's already included with the mixer and you only need one!
1," A help indeed!: WOW.... was referred to this book by a friend. Can definately say it was worth the purchase. After having a girl when our son came along I was getting so frustrated. He was so different to her. Raising boys brought a lot of insight into why they are different but more importantly the stages that boys go through. It all made sense as I read. It has provided vital information for the future and how best to try to keep him out of ""trouble""."
1, Statlers Short Stories: My original copy was stolen along with my truck 20 years ago
1, A good RE-print!: Main characters:Joni Evans and her four year old son Brady.Sam Crawford.Joni & Brady move from Chicago to Saddle (cute name)
0, Book has a misleading title.: It's not really going to give you a checklist of things that you want to make sure you do before you sign. Instead it is a book that discusses in general a few things you might want to consider
0, Not good: Not worth the money
1," One of my Favorites: This book was not at all what I expected. I am a huge fan of Emily Giffin books and one of my favorites is ""Something Borrowed."" ""How I Stole Her Husband"" is much like ""Something Borrowed"" in that it will have you rooting for the underdog. I couldn't put this book down!"
1, Was looking for something like a PS2 controller--found it.: From a choice of about 15 gamepads I chose this one. It felt similar to the PS2 controller and had some weight to it (even before the batteries were installed). Installation was easy; installed software on a PC with 2000 for an operating system. I really enjoy the freedom of not having to worry about a cord. The inputs were received fine
1, I love my wingman!: I love this thing. It plays better than any corded pad I own.Pros:Dual analog
1, I just listened to the whole thing...: ... after forgeting about this album for awhile
1, Great album: Last Rainbow album in the classic line-up and therefore a must have for Rainbow fans. I think Rainbow Rising is still there best recording
0, Giving this Book Zero Stars...: Is a *serious* overestimation of its usefulness.Schnobelen claims to have been highly-ranked in several religious organizations (Several of which didn't and don't exist
0, Once again ANOTHER Christian Just NOT Understanding: For anyone to say Wicca is that of Satan is totally wrong!!! I raise my chidren in the religion along with thousands and thousands of others
0, Really??: Sorry folks
1," A solid 12 song comp and best seller for Mercury since 1960: This collection is a reissue of the classic compilation from 1960 entitled ""Golden Hits"" on Mercury which among its 12 songs are several of her signature songs including Tennessee Waltz"
1, Love the modern language: I have an older copy of Morning and Evening and love Spurgeon's writing. However
0, Had to return it...: The hair dryer is very heavy. Also
0, Beware! Not the same old FriChik: Please be aware that the 'Low Fat' variety of this product is NOT the same as the standard 'FriChik'. Whatever is removed to be able to sport the 'Low Fat' moniker makes a world of difference. Standard FriChiks are delicious while the 'Low Fat' variety are drier and less tasty (savory). I hope someone at Amazon will take notice and start offering the standard FriChik.
0, Crowded: So now she has her ex-boyfriend
1, Mind Blowing: Season three of Fringe is a roller coaster. Fringe is one of the most exciting tv shows that always keeps you wanting more
1, Great Series: Sesson 3 provides another wonderful roller coaster of drama that makes it easy watching. Great cast that allows us the audience to engage most easily in these Sci-fy stories
1, It's good: Everything work out well. Shipment was on time and all the things were in good working order. The quality was good.
1, The Other Universe...: LOVE
1, It'll make you think about your health benefits: Wonderful book! This will make you rethink the health benefit options you select at enrollment.
0, Absolutely Awful: I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now
1, Great toys with squeakers: This 3 pack is pretty good. I have a 5 lb. Yorkie and he doesnt care much for the 3 squeaking mini tennis balls but wow
0, Looks Good
0, Possibly the worst movie I ever watched: This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it. I repeat
0, Horrible writing
1, Casablanca for the 21st century: Casablanca meets Death Wish in a beautiful festival of violence. Bruce Willis was Humphrey Bogart and Clive Owen was Charles Bronson. While Mickey Rourke actually sort of reminds me of King Kong. He's out of control and you know he's got to die but still its a shame. Sin City itself is set in a world where money has bought all power. In other words
0, I was very surprised and dissapointed: I really thought this movie was going to be the best for the year. It had such a big name cast and the special effects looked so cool; it was all exciting. what a surprise i was in for. firstly
0, Lacking: So this DVD seemed promising as the menu was up and I was geared up to watch this excellent movie...but then once it started something very important seemed to be missing....yes it was the audio throughout the film. There was audio in the menu but not the actual movie...so that was pretty lame
1, Sin City in BD
1, So far one of 2005's bests...EASILY!: This movie was so good to me in April
1, great movie!: the way frank miller made this movie was like a 1950's crime novel. mostly in black and white with splashes of color! the three storys intertwine with each other! thhis is a must have in either DVD on on the Kindle.
0, misogynistic junk: wow! hookers with heart! child rapists! brutal murder! senseless nudity!at first
0, GREAT MOVIE 
0, Sin City: Typical Quentin Tarantino film. You either love him or you hate him. This film was very gratuitous sex and violence wise. Not a whole lot of deep plot thinking. I did give it atleast two stars for the unusual filming techniques and special effects.
0, Don't Waste Your Money: I was dragged to the theaters by my brother to go see this movie. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it (action is not usually my thing)
0, yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!: the one reviewer was right
0, I had to turn it off after an hour...: This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching. It's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.Skip this one unless you like the comic books.
0, hate to give a blockbuster a 1
0, Junk: Quite the worst film I have ever seen in my 76 years!The inadequacy of the above rating system reminds me of the story about the old Danish professor who found himself forced to modify the usual marking system in order to do justice to the proficiency of his students. In the usual system the highest mark was 6
0, Tired of these kind of releases: Love this movie! A must see movie! Hate these kinds of releases though. I'm waiting for the Dec 2 disc release with all of the extras. The only thing I'm happy about is that they told us another deluxe DVD was coming. It doesn't make the wait any easier though. I was anxiously awaiting this movie on DVD
1, Very artistic: This movie is very graphic and dark - themed
0, Not a review
1, Terribly violent movie: How much violence does a movie-viewer tolerate? Be it cult or not
0, the casual humdrum of death and male ego...yawn....: Where are the intelligent and creative masses that yearn for expression other than the casual humdrum of death and male ego???...yawn.... Boring! This movie is made for unintelligent 19 year old boys who are filled with frustration
0, Not worth seeing: The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books. However
0, Boxing Day
0, Absolutely Disappointing: I have no problem with a group experimenting
0, Hey Courtney...: Concentrate more on songwriting
1, An Invaluable Find: I teach a course on the history of Witchcraft at a local esoteric shop
1, Great family movie!: This movie was a really a nice surprise! Bindi Irwin did a great job and all the characters are played very well. My five and two year old daughters LOVE this movie and watch it over and over. I think I like this free willy movie the best out of the whole series.
0, Nothing like the original kong: I don't like this toy. It's an odd shape
0, Not for aggresive chewers: I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 lb springer spaniel mix). She rips toys apart with her incisors. She ripped the tabs off around the hole opening in a few minutes. She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball. I am sure the ball would be great for normal chewers
0, Useless for non chewers: Stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily. Might be fun for heavy chewers
0, Dog destroyed it within 30 minutes: The toy lasted about 30 minutes. Not much more to say than that. I obviously wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
1, I have 3
1," Bit on the Dark Side: I got this book because I so enjoyed ""The Devil's Waters"
1, I Love Historical Fiction: I love historical fiction
1, Mac users - There is no problem: I am writing this review solely for the purpose of rebutting the other reviews that say this printer won't print borderless ona Mac using iPhoto. That is absolutely wrong. This person obviously does not know how to properly use the software and Epson drivers. This is a killer little printer and works perfectly on a Mac in iPhoto. Just make sure you set all settings everywhere (including iPhoto) to 4x6 and use the borderless option in the driver.
0, RIPPED OFF: I was ripped off. This printer was listed as NEW but arrived USED AND BROKEN
0, I don't care for this printer: This photo printer will crop your photographs regardless whether you cropped or not. The person that you photographed will have their head cut off! if their head is close to the edge. Make sure you have plenty of empty space between your subject and the edge of your photo before you send it to print. In other words
1, Very handy printer: This is you: You bought a digital camera and took a lot of pictures
1, Epson Photomate Photo Printer: Prints very clear quality pictures and does not have to be hooked up to the computer.
1, review: Product arrived on time. Took a week playing with settings to get the sound I wanted. User/Setup manual needs a thorough Index. Seems like a good unit
0, onkyo 7.1 worst electronic purchase ever: i bought this receiver a yr ago & it has already quit working (at the most inconvenient time**
0," Disappointed: I bought this phone because of the range and speaker phone feature. I immediately found that the phone kept displaying ""line 2"" active when there was only one line to the phone. The battery in the handset died after only two months and a replacement never charged. When I returned it to the manufacturer via instructions I received a factory-reconditioned older phone with only 900 mhz in return with no other explanation. I will never buy a UNIDEN phone again."
0, Difficult to hold: We have other cordless can openers in the past and this one really disappointed us. While this may be a really great can opener
0, Not pleased with product: The knife on the can opener will not penetrate some cans
1, Fantastic Can Opener 2 Years and Going Strong: We're coming up on two years of steady use with this little jewel and very happy with it. It takes a little practice at first learning the proper way to position it
0, Not fun!!: I bought this item because the reviews said it was fun
0, Cordless can opener: Was not able to use after around 3 cans. Recharging was OK but the opener just did not have the torque to open larger numbers of cans.
0, Hand Held Opener: This is an unique opener in that it is one handed and battery operated
0, Disappointed: This device does open cans but it is difficult to position to get it started. It was purchased to replace a 25 year old opener that was easy to use one handed and required no strength to make it work. This one requires that you are able to push hard with your thumb (which I cannot do due to joint problems) in order to operate. If you ave 2 good hands it is fine. I need something else. Keeping this and my husband uses it.
0, One star is too many: This gizmo is a costly dud. The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice. The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date. They had not. Then the last strip worked. I must have made a mistake
0, Cherry--maybe
1, GREAT
0, Don't Buy Defective Product and No Returns: Do not purchase any of the items from razer. First of all
0, Weems & Plath Barometer: A nice looking decoration to hang on the wall
0, the 900 days;: Having made 2 trips toSt. Petersburg in the past 3 years
0, Disappointing/undisciplined/incomplete: Salisbury certainly must be embarrassed by this book. It is not even an acceptable first draft. If the title were changed to 'The first 90 Days' it would be more accurate. His time line is a mess. He space is just as bad as he provides no sense of the geography or the role it played. Reader never knows when and where he is. Also
0, Awful
1, Early Asimov Still Beats Par: It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's great Science Fiction works remain out of print. The three `Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some
0," Poor Quality Workmanship: I read every review that I could and finally picked the Phillips 8"" even though it was more expensive due to the poor write ups the other digital picture frames were receiving. I agree totally with everyone that the transfer software from the PC is a piece of junk. Very poor for such a well known company. Even with all that"
1, GREAT CASE: My A540 fits great and it also held two SD card and two extra batteries
0, Not compatible with Canon A630: I got this case along with A630 since the product description mentioned that it is compatible with the A630. However
1, Canon camera case review: The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries.
1, Canon A520 Case: The case is great! It fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what I expected to receive when ordering. The price was right but the shipping was a little higher than I expected.
0, Too small!: The case is too small for my A630 and it doesn't look like the one shown in the picture. The lid can barely be closed and no room for anything else. I am very disappointed at this product.
0, Doesn't fit A640: This product lists the A640 as one it works with. It doesn't. Not even a tight fit. Just flat out doesn't fit.But
0, Great photos--flawed recipes: My husband is a chef
0, Foghorn Flounders: I tried to get through this CD again the other day
1, Latter Days: In this case
0, Good guide to the battlefield
0, Pure garbage: This book reflects a message about what I'm thinking is the author's own religious bias. It's garbage. No where does it even mention population control
0, Supplier: The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem. The shoes that arrived had been worn. I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had. He made a good offer however
1, Easy Purchase: Love them
1, Love Love Love: Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
0, All right if you're slumming it: Eh. I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap
0, Mislabeled: I have worn Keds sneakers for many years
1, Keds black sneaker: Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
0, Not like Death Note at all: The acting was terrible and L's character had no opportunity to be the eccentric genius he usually is. It lacked the thrill
1, A spectacular growing up book: This was one of my favorite childhood books. No
0, Poorly written and edited.: The book is poorly written and edited. He never does get the name of the Viet Cong sniper rifle spelled right. The author without mentioning any names calls into question the actions of late Gunnery Sgt. Carlos N. Hathcock II. I wonder why he doesn't write another book calling into question the actions of Sgt. Alvin York or Lt. Audie Murphy. If you want to read a good book skip this one. I was let down by this one.
0, Brass slide jammed: I just got the marking gauge and just as described in another review
1, Altec Lansing XT2 Speakers: Heard about these speakers on XM Radio and decided to buy and try them. When I got them was surprised at how easy to connect and the sound. Sound is just Fantastic. My laptop never sounded so good with all the music I have downloaded. Recommend these to anyone useing a laptop at home.

1, A beautiful medley of great songs: The only reason why I gave Sg. Pepper 4 stars is because I got sick of it. But I remember every night listening to it striaght through
0, For the Archives: There is some history that is still relevant today and there is other that should be recognized as influential in its time

0, Crowned a TOPPER!!!!!: hI to everyone.Im gonna say it like it is. This album is terrible and dull.Oh yeh and it's hopelessly contrived and utterly passable.Let me count votes.I expect a 100 whining 'no's by 12 o clock tonite.Bless y'all
0, Falls Short: It was disappointing to discover that this CD falls short of all the praise it seems to get in these reviews
1, undeniably influential
1, The Mastery Of Sgt. Pepper: Sgt. Pepper changed it all
1, Greatest Album Ever: This album redefined the Beatles and redefined rock music in general. Everyone on the whole planet should own this album. Everyone who I know who hates the Beatles loves this album.
0, Pretentious tripe: I am a big fan of progressive rock. What I don't understand is how people can rip Yes
0, just wondering: Thanks for reading my review. I have only one short consideration.What wood this disk have sounded like WITHOUT intoxicating substances? You TThank you!
1, Best album with best song ever made!: This is my favorite Beatles' album. Yes
1, wow: It may not be the best Beatles CD
1, One of the greatest albums of all time . . .: . . . and
1, Overrated: Half this album's allure
1, Sgt. Peppers (1967 album...1987 CD): The Beatles/ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: I'm perfectly happy with my old CD version of this nearly perfect album. There is no need for me to describe this album to you. If you don't have a copy
0, Shameful Packaging: 42 years later and Sgt. Pepper is as brilliant as ever...enough said
1, Wonderfully Put Together! I Love it!: I love it. I'm 11 and I heard all this stuff about the Beatles. Thought I'd try it out. After this CD I got Beatles 1. It was even better. I like how it's put together and the song about Paul at the end. It's cool how George has a song too. This is a great album. It's great for kids and adults and anyone who's willing to listen...
1, Paul's Shining Moments: It's not that I don't like this album. Revolver is just better. The most interesting thing about this album is that Paul actually sings a song about himself in the first person and ends up (purposely) sounding like John. I'm referring
0, Over-inflated Piffle!: Just try getting through Mr. Kite or Within You Without you. A condescending middle finger to the fans that appreciated of them as a rock and roll band. By this point in their careers (read:millionaires)
1, These are wonderful for teaching phonemes: This is a good system that my children's school uses. I have been an early childhood teacher for 5 years and I would have loved this system. I didn't have access to the RIGGS system in the schools I taught at. This requires a lot of parental involvement
1, Great Books: Francesca Lia Block has the ability to take you anywhere in her beutifully writtern books and in this she takes you to the over exposed world of the Valley. All her books are magical
0, Bad book!!: After reading good reviews and liking the idea of the story I just couldn't get into this book. I was really excited and was very disappointed! It was vague and just didn't flow. I tried and tried and couldn't get through half the book.
0, Argh! Read this!: I love faeries. they are beautiful amazing creatures that allow people to escape reality. So
1," Botany at its most entertaining: The author loosely applies the label ""North American Wildflower"" to all blossoms now running free on our continent. Many were brought over by early European settlers and the plants quickly jumped out of the garden and into the wild. Author includes snippets for each plant from other literary sources dating throughout the centuries (some very funny and bawdy!)"
1, Neat!: I don't know how popular this game was
1, AMAZING!!: This CD is now my all time favorite. When Deep Forest made their first album
1, good album but x-mobs got a better one: great album specially if u like the real underground stuff but if u can buy x-mob paperchasing first. its a down south classic
0, Not her best work: LOVED Jari's Ripped 1000 and this was a disappointment in comparison. BORING
1, Works great!: This elliptical is great
0, Somewhat disturbing.: I started reading this book because the title itself seemed interesting.. The idea of the book seemed good.. The begining was interesting enough
1, great: been looking for this cd for years since my cassette was destoryedin a house fire. it sounds just as great as it did when it firstcame out. thanks!!!!!
1, A great way to relive Olympic memories: A great way to relive Olympic memories. It's hard to remember the stars of past Olympics unless you go back and review these tapes.
0, Cliche
0, An Embarassment: I was sadly disappointed and probably the last time I will ever think of buying her book. Next time I will just save the money and borrow it from the library. there's just no improvement in her writing. This is even more unoriginal then her last two books. It reminds me of a rip off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I expected more from her. This is garbage
1, Good
1, GOOD Solid Disc: I really Enjoyed This Disc.it had alot of Styles&Flavors going on.Tight Raps&Grooves through out.A Very Underated Group.this Disc is Still Good.
0," Total Crap: Pitiful book filled with more conjecture than fact. The writer feels the need to skip around Mary and Bonny's stories so that she can throw in tidbits of OTHER pirates' histories as well as her interpretation of what ""might"" have happened. I really hope there's a GREAT book of Anne and Mary out there"
0, waste of time and money: I should have read the reviews a little closer. This is not a Bon Jovi authorized documentary. You can find better discussions on YouTube. Don't waste your time or money.
0, Where is Sue Grafton?: I was incredibly disappointed in this book. The writing style was not what I was used to in previous books. Gone was the light touch. Instead
0, It was the first I read but...: This was the first Sue Grafton book read so I went in with an open mind. The writing is drawn out but the mystery is even worse
1, P=Perfectly different: This is not a typical Kinsey Milhone mystery and unless you are a hard-core Grafton fan you might not like this one. This one has alot of stuff on Medicare and Social Security regs and this can be dull but in Grafton's (Kinsey's) hands it isn't. Best moment when Kinsey realizes she bugging the wrong suspect.
0, THIS JUST IN: KINSEY MILLHONE LOSES HER VOICE!: I just read L through P in one week. L through O were well told
0, Entertaining to Awful: In the beginning
0, P is for Pretty Darned Boring: I have read every book that Sue Grafton has written and looked forward to this latest release. What a disappointment. This book was SO BORING I had difficulty staying awake to finish it. I never did figure out what the entire plot was supposed to be about. And for heaven's sake
1, Kinsey does it again!: I bought the unabridged audio book to add to my collection
0," P for ""P U"": The only ""peril"" in this book was the disappointment at the end. I have read A through O and have enjoyed them and was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment! I would not recommend this book...rather turn the TV on and watch another rerun of ""Lavern and Shirley"". If refunds are being given"
0, P is for Poop: I have enjoyed most of Sue Grafton's books
0, Nasty compilation of good books...: You're much better off going to the original books this compilation rips off. There are editing mistakes galore in this volume
0, Phenomena II is fantastic music...: Great songs
1," The Deighton Family produce beautiful sounds: I played traditional English/Irish music for many years but I can listen to and enjoy anything. What drew me to this group was a snippet of ""Taxman"" that I found on the web when looking for something else. I bought their ""Rolling Home"" (Green Linnet) album on the strength of it and"
0," Worst than the First: Saw I had promise and and descended in to a plot mess. Saw II is absurd and not even scary. The basic problem is twofold: 1)Jigsaw as a serial killer is no Hannibal Lector--in fact you almost feel sorry for the poor bastard as Wahlberg beats the crap out of him 2)Killing a bunch of ex-cons does not evoke much empathy. Additionally the ""clever"" trick ending renders the entire movie and plot as absurd and trite. The basic idea behind both of these movies could have provided for some real scares but instead we are treated to a poorly written convulted plot structure that is not even close to being believable. The best serial killer films are very basic and raw--Saw II like Saw I bites off more than it can chew. A waste........"
0, Let's not play anymore little games!: There are no surprises in this second Saw movie anymore. Again Jigsaw the Great has created a mysterious sadistic masterplan to have his victims appreciate their lives a bit more. This time however watching the movie you simply don't believe the story anymore. I think the first Saw was splendid
0, Announce your spoiler: The person before me typed a massive spoiler for the movie and didn't feel the need to tell people. Nice job kid. My view of the movie was this. I really liked the first Saw
0, Wow. This movie sucks bad.: Its about a bunch of people who are locked in a house and die in different ways. No seriously. Thats it. If you enjoy watching people die with a little soap opera plot attempt thrown in....this is for you. Its violent. Big deal. So is Shindler's List and we're not calling that a horror movie
1, Not as good as the first but real close: The main difference in this movie is Jigsaw. In the first one you didn't know who he was and saw very little of him. In the second you see quite a bit of him. This is both a plus and a negative. On the positive side jigsaw is a very interesting character and is played very well. But on the other hand the mystery of
0, Saw II DVD: i was very disappointed that the movie did not have a cover and i bought a brand new copy of it
1, If any book should be re-published it is this!: This is the most moving book I have ever read. It is also my wife's favorite book. She spent a significant amount of dollars buying a copy about ten years ago. The writing is good but it is the story that jumps off the page. The author and her family are incredible yet the story is told with extreme modesty. If more people read this book the world would be less egocentric.
1, Great printer.: This is my first non-HP printer and I am very impressed. The print quality on B&W text seems slightly less than HP
0, Poor quality and design: The black ink works after just 18 months
0, Do not buy this printer: I bought this printer less than a month ago and its already not working right. The paper keeps jamming.The paper tray is jammed and won't come out of the printer. I tried using the other paper feed and I get the same response that the paper is jammed. I wish I had paid attention to the amazon reviewer who mentioned the paper jam problem. This is my first and last time buying Brother.
1, Mind Opening Literature: Becoming me is a wonderful book. As I read it to my children it had me looking at the things around me in a whole new way. Any book that can capture the attention of my children (ages 3 and 5) and have me re-examining the world is fantastic!
1, Live drums
0, Not a good example of history for students: While the language isn't boring the the ideas are great in Youngs second edition of this biography
0, How was this so bad?: This movie had two top stars and a pretty good plot
0, How dare you !: A soldier gives the order to shoot on a crowd of civilians (including kids)...lots of dead.And it seems like the director want us to care about the guyUS army self justification at its worst?
0, I'm being generous: First of all
0, Look elsewhere: I recently purchased TV SlideShow Studio and spent many hours creating a presentation that would be shown at my daughter's wedding reception. What I found after the effort was that
0, Overblown Movie About Overrated Singer: I've always felt that Jim Morrison's death at a young age spared him the humiliation of being unmasked as a mediocre artist and a low-rent character. This movie did nothing to change my view. Kudos to Val Kilmer for a great performance
1, GREAT PICTURE & SOUND!: (Blu-ray version)For only those
0, Is the Aspect Ratio Correct?: I picked up this 2 disc 15th anniversary edition (THE ONE WITH THE PURPLE COVER) a couple years ago when it was being blown out new for $6 & just got around to watching it. It's one of those ultra wide & short wide screens
1, Lessons for Life: I have read this book twice and given it as gifts to several friends who work to make Gospel teachings a model for their everyday lives. There is something here for everyone--joy
1, Powerful message on the healing process for all: This well written book is so helpful. In a unique and open style
1, Inspirational: This book is one I share with people who see peace in me and wonder how to get in touch with their own. I have read this book many
1, Power Through Constructive thinking: Emmet Fox's books are so classic. He is a prolific writer with mystic abilities. I like the simjplicity with which he explains the most of complex mysteries of our universe and creation. His explanations of the writings of Jesus
1, Replacement lawn mower blade: I needed new blades for my mower

1, amazing!: christina aguilera is truly a versatile teen star. She can sing and dance very well. this dvd is a sure proof!
1, Truly fascinating stories-even for a guy who's not pregnant!: Shu Shu has really whipped up something great here - a simmering broth of intriguing anecdotes and ancient wisdom cooked to perfection. I couldn't put it down!
0, old release
0, Unreasonably priced on Amazon: One can buy the same 32 oz Bottle from grocery store for $9.99 thus making a 6 bottle purchase to $59.64 even after paying sales tax it will be much less than $75.36 +shipping. I dont know why would someone buy it from Amazon.
1, Blue Grass/Spiritual: If you love the religious and blue grass tones

1," The Bee Gees Biggest Studio Album!: In the difficult position of having to top ""Saturday Night Fever"""
1, A Book for Coaches and Parents: This book is an easy and enjoyable read; at times you even find yourself smiling at the examples Michael Stabeno uses to illustrate his points. The book is comprehensive as it discusses what ADHD is
1, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines: I receieved this novel today
1, A wondeful toy...: It is an awesome toy to have your kids doing more exercise and to train their connection between eyes and hands. The stand and the basket ring are very strong. The adjustable height is so easily to change. No problem at all for assembly. I am putting the toy indoor in the living room for my 3-yr and 2-yr kids
1, 3 Year Old Grandson: I purchased this for my 3 year old grandson's birthday. He along with his older brothers are having a fun time with it. It is much sturdier than the smaller ones that the older boys had. I like the fact that it is adjustable so it will grow with him and be usable for a few years.
1, Lots of information: This book is great for including the many different ways families come together. Adoption
0," Save your money...: I purchased this item last year. The first one wasn't even completely assembled. The water leaked out all over the counter and floor. My husband took it apart and the hoses weren't attached. It made ice once and I returned my new unit to Sunpentown for another. That one worked for several months without a problem. Then the ""needs water"" light kept coming on and it would not make ice. I did just read on another site review that if you tip it backwards"
1, Great book for young children: This is a great little book for working with young children
0, Hard to Use: Purchased this for use with the New LG Chocolate phone. Downloaded the updates needed to use it with the new phone. So far have been unable to do anything with it. Will continue to try

1, My Daughter (Age 3) Loves This Book: I never tire of reading this book with my daughter. Me and My Amazing Body has inspired many conversations about the human body and health. It is simple
0, Very Creepy Illustrations: The text of this book is okay
1, THE EAGLES - HELL FREEZES OVER: The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DVD is the next best thing to being at The Eagles 1995 Hell Freezes Over Concert! I was at the then
1," A must buy...but not a DTS ""demonstration"" dvd!: A really enjoyable concert! It is nice to see and hear the Eagles again! My only complaint"
1, Best all round music DVD: I've collected about 20 music DVDs from various artists.This one is still the best.Each song is well known--there are no filler songs. Also the use of DTS and the individual speakers is very well done. In many songs different voices or instruments are recorded onto different speakers. It is not gimmicky but instead is very smooth and pleasing.The artists look very emotional as they sing. That's nice to see.The little one minute DTS surround sound demo as you start the DVD is very impressive too.
0, good if your diehard into them: If you have all their albums
0, 5.1 ADVICE: Be careful when ordering this DVD. It is recorded in either DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1. Make sure your RECEIVER processes DTS otherwise buy the Dolby Digital version. Most all DVD players read and send a DTS & Dolby Digital signal to your receiver but make sure your receiver processes DTS and/or Dolby Digital before you make your decision. I have the DTS version but no DTS processer and had to select the enhanced stereo setting. On the other hand the sound is still impressive. So far no other DVD I've purchased compares in overall quality. I'm convinced this is the best way to enjoy music. I've stopped buying CDs and only buy music DVDs now. I'm waiting for my old classics to be re-mixed to 5.1 sound with some clips from concerts.
1," This is all I expected !!!: I bought this with FleetwoodMac's ""Dance"" yesterday. This one blown FM away! It has all the best songs of Eagles in their original 'form' (the way I like it). And the Video/Audio is simply fantastic !Two Thumb's up up up ...."
1, A must have for an Eagle's fan!!!!: By far this is the BEST DVD concert.I have seen the Eagles just recently in Denver and this is just as good if not better.
1, Music The Way It Should Be !: What an amazing production. As a professional musician
1," Good show!: This is a great show and fun to watch! I thought the concert/tour was pretty good and this video captures the band at a critical time when they were getting their ""act"" together...worth the money and multiple watches and a great addition to the collection!"
1," Better than being there: This video only has one DTS encoded track (bonus)and any of the other cuts would make it worth buying. From ""Take It Easy"" to ""New York Minute"" the concert takes were clean"

0, Definatly Not A Favorite: This is the first Hemingway I've read and I have to say that I was disapointed. I did like the scenes with the boy and the old man but that was about it! But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book. As one reviewer said

1, Dope-a-scope
1, A True Classic: The Old Man and the Sea is one of the most elegant stories ever written. I have read it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times. The writing has such grace and is so refined and perfect that I could not possibly imagine any sentence being rewritten for the better. The story is wonderful
1, Fascinating
1, Great book...: This book is short

0, It's boring: First of all
1, The book is short but it tells about fisherman's worth life.: Book reviewMy book review is about old man and the sea. It tells you about what is fisher men
0, Not very impressive: Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea has been given A LOT of praise since it was written. Given the task of reading a book by an American author for a high school english class
1, Life as it is: I am amazed at the simplicity of this book
1, Exceptional: A great
1, Very helpful: I understand my daughter's hair-pulling problem much better after reading this book. I never knew it was exacerbated by chastising or threatening. I have focused much more on helping her ease the tension
1, A very excellent item to own...: This book should be read by every woman and every straight man. A very helpful guide that says systematically what you wish had been explained (in such an enjoyable way) from the beginning. It covers the very simple to the more advanced

0, One Arm away from no stars...: If you like over produced
1," An absolute classic.: It's true that this album wasn't as ""metal"" as those before it"
1, Def Leppard's Best: Loads of chart-topping songs on this album
1, Not to be without!: There really isnt more than you can say about this musical masterpiece. This is the quintisential heavy metal album from the 1980s
1, Item picture not exactly what you get: I got my new CD Walkman yesterday; opened it this morning. It plays great
1, what are they talking about: have they even listened to the albumgreat recordnot a sophmore slump thats for surei can set my cd player to random and be happy all daynot a song on the album that i dislike
1, Good quality
1, My daughter's favorite book for two years!: This is a fantastic book! Someone gave it to my daughter when she was a baby
0, DISAPPOINTING: I won't go into the details of the plot itself. The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that. I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it. This book moves very slowly. There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that? There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts. The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting
0, pompeii: If you are expecting a well-crafted
0, B-O-R-I-N-G: Dull and dopey. (And I'm someone who generally *likes* sheik romances!) Unless you're a sheik-romance enthusiast who simply must own every Rudolph Valentino retread to roll down the highway
0, A very tedious book: I truly wanted to read The Pride
1, *powerful*: This sermon is excellent. If you have ever heard of what happened while this sermon was preached (viz.-people yearning to get saved no matter what the cost) then you will understand why they did after you read it. :)
0, What happened to GRACE?: I believe the editor has missed the mark and failed to properly address what the Gospel is all about .... grace. The editor is obviously young and without enough life experience to know how to write the TRUTH. It is a shame that Christians must be fed misinformation by individuals who do not know what they are talking about. It is only by grace that we can come to Him ... the rest is irrelevant.
1, Good Book: Product description was a little off however overall a great product and arrived very fast
0, Gross.: I like all kinds of Power Bars
0, Stored in a hot warehouse?: Ordered in December
1, Not quite as tasty as the rest of the line: These bars have the perfect mix of carbs and protein that I look for in a meal replacement bar
0, Psalms as drama for drama's sake not Psalm's sake: The Psalms in Worship is a selection of Psalms or Psalm parts divided to be read by leader and congregation
0, Text missing between p58 and 59: I had to buy this book under duress (one of those lecturer/author situations at uni)
0, Nothing but Feminazi Rage: I'm getting married next year
0, Double-sided for the same subject-why?: Like the other reviewer said they are double-sided which would be fine if what was on the back was a completely different subject but it's the same (half the months are on one side
0, Barely worth the inexpensive price.: This book barely provides the entertainment value of what it costs to purchase. The photos themselves are haphazard with little artistic value. There are some interesting graphic design elements to this book but they are few. Overall
1," ""I Say Nothing"" is worth the CD price"
0, doesn't work: I bought this book for my kindle touch but it won't download! I really wanted to read it because it sounded interesting. Sincerely 
0, WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT: I had heard that Kim was one of the best books of all time. Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it.Have never been so disappointed in anything. Cults
0, The only Dagliesh book I do not like: I am a huge fan of PD James and Adam Dagliesh
1, One of the finest movies I have had the pleasure of viewing: This is a movie to take the kids to and the grandparents as well. As heartwarming and real as anything I have seen. Living near Cincinnati
0," Lousy: ""Crocodile Rock"" is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio"
1, My first and favorite!: This was the first Elton John album I bought and it remains to this day my favorite. Yes
0, Sadly inaccurate: The historical accuracy of this book is sadly lacking.If you don't think the Confederacy (and therefore its symbol) was built on racism and slavery
1, horse treats: Colorful and the horse loved all of them! Nice small package for travel. It was wonderful to have them so small for a horse on a diet but rewarding for the horse. Each piece is imprinted which is way cute.
1, First Class: A first class performance by a great lady. For anyone who's never listened to Classical or Opera before then Leontyne Price is well worth listening to.
1, Intelligent and Challenging: This is one of books most interesting and challenging books I've ever read. It is enjoyable and the writing style is wonderful. However
0, Boring 
1, Another fine tale from McMurtry: I laughed and I cried. Now that he's read the book
1, Keep another McMurtry novel on hand after this one.: After reading All My Friends are Going to be Strangers
0, Read Everything Else First: Lonesome Dove is one of my favorite books of all time and I have enjoyed all of his other books (Terms of Endearment
1, Best Sounding Speakers For The Bucks: These speakers can't be beat for the price! The lows
1, the duality of business and politics explained: A timely book for the current election
1, Great ideas!!: I bought this book for my Masters class and absolutely love it. It has so many great ideas in it for teachers and parents. I think all preschool
1, Heartbeats and Heartaches: This is a biography based on actual account typify of most intellectual Chinese from PRC. From nationalism
1, Be My Valentine: Be My Valentine is a fast
1, durn burn it Paw....: Dad-blame goodun' we made. And it is now on this new-fangled CD technology! ggjaskgsk Stop messin' with my keyboard
1, A review for GREGG's Shorthand: Dictation and Transcription: This book is great and all
1, Very well written: One of the best as far as romance novels. Very well written with a very moving plot. Basically
0, Mixed Feelings: This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However
1, A++++: This is from a mother. Im not crazy about Disney movies. But I saw this on TV and I was hooked. I couldn't leave the TV. Its sweet
1, pretty good
0, Not great: It does not matter how evenly you attempt to apply this product
0, Doesn't do the job: I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L'Oreal's towlettes before and liked them
0," Horrible Machine and customer service: After having this elliiptical trainer for several months I must say I am very dissapointed with this product and this company. After a month there was a problem with one of the pedals. I called the service line because it is under warranty and the company never answers calls. I was ""on hold"" waiting for the next availbale operator for over an hour. I finally decided to give up and leave a message and an operator did not get back to me two days! Finally after another week Merit did send a technician. The problem was fixed for about a month until the same problem reoccurred. I called Merit again"
0, Small Wagon: This is good for a toy only
1, Perfect Little Red Wagon for Toddlers: My 11 month old boy loved a simliar small little red wagon at my mom's house. He had been walking for about a month
1, jlblake2001: Very cute and well made toy. Use it for your doll collectibles
0, Very short handle: I bought this as a gift for my almost 18 month old nephew for Christmas. The handle was so short that when he tried to pull it even with his arm down all the way
0, Not a toy: I ordered for my nephew who is under two thinking he could put toys in it and pull them around in the wagon. But when I got the wagon I realized it is a item that would work for a basket or to decorate the yard if there were no neighbor kids around. It is not a toy. I am dissappointed as I was looking at the Radio flyer name since my son had a radio flyer when he was a kid maybe it would be a fun toy. It is not a toy even though it comes up under that heading. It belongs in home and garden. I am returning this one to Amazon.
0, Didn't do it for me: After hearing the debut album from Fischer's latest project Triptkon I thought wow I have to check out that Apollyon Sun side project and see what that was all about. I was psyched to find it for a mere two bits brand new from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers. I must admit I am glad that is all I paid for it. It just sounds like a poor White Zombie album to me. I think that Celtic Frost (especially the last line up) was top notch and Triptykon has a great future I believe. I know that this was a side project of Tom's and he admitted it was different from his normal style. I gave this one the 40 minute elliptical trainer test on my ITouch at the gym and it didn't keep me pumped although I still finished! I know some reviewers mentioned NIN and other bands that I have heard that this does sound more like and I realized I don't like those bands so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like this one either.
0, Hmm.. Another Stupid Comedy Behind The Mind of Spy Kids: Yeah... since there's not much to say except it stinks... um.. here's a deleted scene.Kid: They're real!Teacher: No
0, didnt receive it: I did not receive the product. They do seem like they want to help me find it. They gave me a tracking number. But it didnt locate the package so i am awaiting there response
1, SharkBoy/LavaGirl in 3-D: This 3-D adventure is truly for children
0, Possibly the WORST movie ever made!: I have four kids and usually wouldn't make the time to write one of these reviews
0, Don't we have more respect for kids than this?: This is the worst acting in a children's movie that I have EVER seen. Nothing matter with the basic idea of the fanciful plot
0, unbox turned to crap: I hate to say it but unbox has turned to crap! I still have not viewed this movie. It will not download. It goes to que? whatever it is then nothing. I have no problems downloading the free stuff from Amazon so I dont understand why the paid rentals dont work right.
0, this movie made me cringed & twitch to the max: bad acting bad storytelling bad everything i wish this movie was never made i strongly disliked this movie it seriously was a waste of time and money to make god this movie is terrible seriously terrible and i thought my movies were bad but this movie takes the cake and just ruins my childhood foreverSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)Star Wars: Fool's Bargain (Novella)Heir to the Empire (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy
1, Gift for my Great Nephew in Texas: This was a gift for my Great Nephew
1, Excellent for kids: My kids love this movie. I have a toddler & an elementary student. When they are allowed to watch it
0, The movie was gay!: Good god I didn't like it. I thought it would be cool but it wasn't. The special effects are really corny and dumb. You didn't miss out anything on the 3D because I didn't see anything realistic with it. My advice don't waste your money on this. I'm 13 years old and if I were 8 I would probably like it but now that I'm 13 I think it's the dumbest movie ever. Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid. Please do not see it!
0, product is awaful!: I orered both catridges and the color cartridge was not recognised and the black smeared as it printed. They sent me two new ones and the black cartridge ran out of ink after just a few pages. Dont watse your money
1, Really Inspiring!: I hadn't even hit the stories yet
1, CAN YOU GIVE 1000 STARS?: I've just listened to MAY THE MUSIC NEVER END--it's breathtaking
1, Simply works: The only thing they could improve on with this simple ceiling fan switch is to provide the buyer with a chain instead of a string to extend the length.
1, Ultra French Femmes: One might say that this collection is a little heavy on covers of English hits like Paint it Black and Nights in White Satin but that is part of its allure. I would take Marie Laforet over Mick Jagger any day and Patricia's Nights in White Satin would make any breathing human melt like butter on a French Riviera beach. Like any great compilation
1, Really Enjoyed it!: This was a wonderful read on poetry
0, Disappointing PC interface/software: The device works well enough
1, Love it Love it Love it: My daughter loves this
0, Faulty leg causing distress for my baby: I purchased this item for my 6 month old baby and she loved it. It was entertaining for her and kept her busy as she turned herself to play with other items. Then about 2 weeks after buying it
1," Fantastic Entertainer: My daughter started enjoying this around 4-1/2 months though she was too little to touch the ground and some of the toys at that time. However as she has grown...so too has she begun to realize all this toy has to offer. She particularly loves the animal sounds and songs. Her favorite is ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"" and she looks at me every time it plays because I sing it to her. She gets a real kick out of that and that...is pricess!"
0, You can do better: I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line. This is a great product - sturdy
1, Best purchase ever!!!!: We bought this exersaucer when our little guy was barely able to sit upright because we needed a break! We had no idea how much he would love it! He plays with the musical animal buttons like a maniac
1, Keep them entertained!: I bought this for my grandaughter when she was about 5 or 6 months old. Once she learned to turn the seat it really kept her occupied. She liked the music best and would hit it over and over and over! It is very secure and you don't have to worry about them turning over. Of course I like it because it isn't like a walker giving them the opportunity to get into something or pull something over on them. We carried it from room to room. She likes to watch TV in it and it is also a great entertainer when washing dishes. I found nothing about it that I would change. Great item.
0, IMPOSSIBLE to clean.. paint chpped
1, A classic 'pop' album!: East 17 are quite easily the best pop ever. Forget
0," The Spontantous Fulfillment of Desire: I didn't care for the method of presentation. Monotone!! I felt like I had to Work to hard to get what could have been verbalized with a easier approach. Deepak moves through ""Some"" material way to fast and seemed to come to a almost deadening halt going through Why the hand bones connected to the wrist bone"
1, Great protection and good git: This is my second time purchasing this product. My first purchase was almost five years ago and I while my first one is tattered from literally daily use. It still dose the job. I had no issue in purchasing another because I know it works. It also saves my MacBook from all sorts of physical abuse going in and out of my bag and just general travel. In some ways this product will extend the life of your laptop because it will keep it looking like new even long after its not.
0, Missed the mark: Best Tracks: Pound of Prevention
1, Adventures in Paradise (and Love): In my opinion
1, How long it's been....: Back in 1991
1, Kevin Sorbo's best performance ever!: Without question
0, Constant Double bass drum.: DO NOT touch this album if you can't take an almost constant double bass drum throughout almost all the songs. It's exhausting. It's uncreative. It's boring. I don't know if it is good or bad
1," Black Cat Bones - 'Barbed Wire Sandwich' (See For Miles): London based blues rock band's sole album - originally released in 1970. Tracks here that manage to stand out a bit are ""Death Valley Blues"""
1, Rousing
1, Great camera... once i read the manual.: I love this camera i feel like it has changed the way i look at digital photography. I recieved the camera and it was broken but theres always something. That was taken care of in no time. I read the never ending novel of a manual and was shortly after I was having fun and taking photo quality images this camera is for everyone it is easy to use and gives professional results. there is a feature for every thing zoom
0, Mystery for Beginners With Nothing To Do: Harsh
1, Great beach read: It ain't great literature
0, Too simplistic: While the characters are mildly engaging
0, Definitely a Weekend Read: The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character
1, Easy gliding: What a lovely book this is!I read it in 3 hours
1, Wholesome. Wonderful. A great story.: There is nothing not to like about this little book. It is well written
1, 3.5 stars. A pleasant read-but I won't be reading any more of them...: This little detective book isn't exactly a novel in the traditional sense
1, best cthulhu adventure ever: I think that the title to this review says it all. The Masks of Nyarlathotep is by far the best cthulhu adventure that i have played (much better than Delta Green)
1, Excellent: One the best bluegrass videos around!Excellent teaching. A bonus is the wonderful singing that accompanies the lessons.It is a very entertaining video and covers several levels.Highly recommended.
1, Fabuloso: Where has metal been? this is the answer to your prayers. Taking over where epic bands left off
1, Poor Frank: Great story
0," True heroes but lousy author: After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer"
1, Great: These storage bowls have been a nice addition to my dish collection. They came in great shape and have been useful. They go from firdge to microwave to the table and everything matches the dishes.
0, Too wordy to enjoy.: Diane Raines Ward is obviously a well traveled and well educated person
1, Excellent
1, Lightweight and Clarity: For the money
0, Zoom: The picture quality is great but if you're interested in the zoom feature
0, Great when it works but it didn't last a year: this camera worked fine for a while but then slide piece came off and the camera stopped working....cost too much to fix......don't buy...too much for a throw away..
0, Soooo slow.: It is a long time since i read a book that slow and boring.But now i know a lot about the streets and hotel rooms in Washington D.C.I also know how to operate an old VHS tape-recorder.Everything is just so slow and detailed that u will probably go to sleep very fast.I did.
0, Remote husband: Great setting for a crime - everyone snowbound or snowblind perhaps. The psychologist/sleuth is only a husband bringing hiswife's purse to the hospital. A good read if you enjoy lawyers in trouble
1, A very moving and amazing conversion story: Judy Mamou touched my heart with her personal story of her life. She rose from the depths of abuse and degradation to find the love of God and change her life. I read this story as a young child and again today
0, Brothers and sisters: I have not received this item yet and was wondering where it was. Im very disapointed as I alway receive them on time please send this asap
1, Brothers & Sisters final season: Funny family drama. It was nice season to see. I am so so sorry that this was the last one.
1, Love This Clock: We really love this clock. It has a great look and sounds great. We did turn down the sound some since it is near our TV room. It's nice to have that option.
1, Get Your Own!!LOL: Quite a lovely smell.Or as the ladies I've been with have said.Can't complain.Waiting on my second shipment.Try it yourself and you'll get the compliments.But don't put on too much.Too much of anything is never good for you.I generally put on about 3 sprays
1, Great Value: The watch is beautiful and works perfectly. Great value for the money. Shipping was prompt and packaging was appropriate for gift giving.
0, Ick!: Dismal and overwrought bio of silent cinema's first Latin lover. Casts Valentino as the victim of scheming women at every turn. Offers no new information
1," Dig Dis: ""When you wake to find that everything has left you and your clothes belong to someone else..."" - Just one of the great lyrics on this soulful"
1, If you like the music of the band Traffic.: As an original fan of the Jam and then of the Style Council
1, Not bad at all...........: This is a pretty cool game. Its VERY challenging
0," ""Hooray For Boobies"" doesn't have me shouting for joy.: ""The Bad Touch"" is a funny song. Hats off to Jim for coming up with some great catchy lyrics"
1, Hell Yeah Says it all: If any of you don't like this
1, Bloodhound Gang is hilarious: This is a great cd. Its wicked funny and just all around stupid stuff but thats what makes it so funny. b-hound gang rulez and they're the best
0, a very bad joke: this is strickly for laughs.i mean this group is either doing a bad parody of 80's synth bands or they are Wierd Al's Air Apparents.also they sound like too much of what's out on the radio.a little Offspring
1, just what you'd expect: This book was just as fun and humorous as the other George and Martha books. Just what we were hoping for and expecting.
0, Not my Cup of Tea: I'm pretty easily amused
0, Rubbish: I actually thought that Ellen would be funnier. This is just rambling nonsence. Just as though she has scribbled down the first thing that came to mind. Not for me
1, Ellen unplugged and at her best.: Ellen does a fanastic job making and writing her own stories jokes and words in this book. She encourages you not to always take things so seriously and gives you a major laugh. WARNING: Only read while on firm surface- you might fall off of it laughing.
0, Disappointing and then some...: I am one of the biggest Ellen fans out there
0," Downright disgusting: This book makes ""Mein Kampf"" look like a Zionist manifesto. It is the most repulsive thing I have ever read."
1, Love is a blessing: This a book of beautiful poems and writings describing what love means. It is a wonderful gift for those engaged persons and for those celebrating wedding anniversaries (from the first anniversary to the golden or diamond ones). I recommend reading it often to keep love alive in your relationship.
1, Just what I was looking for: Very useful. I think we will be using this book for most of our wedding ceremony
1, Great buy!: These capsules are great. I really like them. They are easy to separate and very smooth. Great product!
1, Thanks-Calvin and Hobbes Collection: The book arrived quickly
1," A must watch...: ""Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds"" is not as good as the first movie"
0, Book: Did not care for this book since I felt that not only was it a slow moving book
0, Weak characters
0, KEEP away from this book: I really like all of Perri O'Shaughnessy's books. The Nina Reilly character is a really well fleshed-out character. Unfortunately
1," Great CD: Years ago I heard the La's heartbreaking ""There She Goes"" on a Top 40 station. But for some reason it never received heavy rotation (this was 1990 or 1991 when Vanilla Ice and Marky Mark permeated the airwaves). Years later I bought the La's one and only CD expecting that to be the only decent song but I found the other songs were great"
0, Did not make the first cup before it died: Plugged it in - Did not make it to the first cup before the thing died and left a burnt smell in the vehicle. Apparently the fuse blew.
1, Good surprise: I really enjoy this CD. Althougth the tracks have very similar sounds--that sound is great. The beats are rather catchy and her voice is pretty smooth. A very realxing
1, Great pop/soul music with a nostalgic angle.: It's much too early to call I Am Shelby Lynne a classic
0, She's Shelby Lynn And You Aren't: I rather expected to like Shelby Lynn
1, Thank you NPR for introducing me to Shelby's music!: A little bluesy
0, Try with some other songwriters
0, critique of paul the apostle: we viewed it as a family
0, Hawaii Video: The island scenes are nice but it is a boring video. You put it on to play while you work as background noise. They focus too long on beach scenes and water.
0, wont work: From my memory
1, An objective view of mysterious coincidences: The incredible coincidences in the case studies presented in this book are handled with great objectivity by Stiffler. I have just reunited with my birthmother and sent her a copy of the book as well. After reading the book
1, A superior edition: I have attempted the elements before but found myself caught in the voluminous commentary by its translator
0," Not As Advertised: These are advertised as ""5.25; 6; 6.5""I bought these thinking they were pre cut; and to switch to 6.5"" you would just need to snap out the inner part.Anyway; I was wrong. Completely FALSE description.......These are for 5.25"" ONLY; unless you feel like cutting and drilling them yourself.If that was the case; I could have bought a plastic sheet and did it myself.Definitely not worth the time wasted here......"

0, No subtitles: I was disappointed to find that when I received the DVDs that there are no subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired and there was no notation on the product description to that effect.
1, Simultaneously stimulating and relaxing: Charles Wilson speaks to all the channels of your heart
1, Reliable workhorse: This was one of the first mice I ever bought. I've had it for at least four years and it's performed reliably with every computer it's been connected to. I've brought it with me from job to job and back and forth from home and have never had any problems with it. The buttons always click crisply and the wheel revolves easily. Now I'm buying another one to permanently connect to my home laptop workstation so I can leave one at work and one at home.
0, Don't waste your time: Collection of conjecture that was at times painful to read. The recent Mirage annual report gives a better perspective of Wynn's gaming empire and how it was built.
0, THE PROGRESS PARADOX: Complete waste of money the most pathetic book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Please save your money and do not purchase this book
1, Good news is good stuff.: Check out a podcasts on the book on EconTalk.No matter how optimistic you think you are
0, Total Crap! Read the Reviews of The Non-Illustrated Version!: This book did not get published. This author can't be trusted. The book is based on appalling inaccuracies.Alexander the Great galloping into Alexandria & plundering the royal library? Really?Alexander FOUNDED the city of Alexandria. He & his men built the city from the dirt up. Ptolemy (a general in Alexander's army who later became the Pharoah of Egypt) created the royal library after Alexander's death. Aristotle had nothing to do with it.No doubt Persia
0," Good idea gone wrong: I found the 2.1 version (the latest version) slow and inflexibile. It actually produced the wrong answers for my health insurance policies and the results could not be adjusted manually. Also found the ""Help"" section far from helpful although on-line assistance was responsive (although unable to make it right). I think Intuit just got this program into the market too quickly without proper testing."
0, Terrible: I love all quicken products
0," Don't be fooled: The tech specs list this computer as having an NvidiaGF4MX. If you think you are getting a true GF4 think again. You aren't even getting a GF3. The GF4MX is just a GF2(!) that has been rebranded as a GF4""MX"".A true GF4 card is compatible with the latest standards"
1, Great book: This was a very interesting reading. It was practical and easy to understand. We used many chapters in our class.

0, Dead on arrival: Our Dell PC wouldn't boot up with this DIMM installed. I'm going to try another brand of memory.
1, Could be better!: I wasn't expecting too much from this book when I bought it because it's suppose to be a programmers reference anyway. My problem is: instead of confusing new ASP programmers on database access
0, Kindel Version: This is one of my favorite books but once again very disappointed with the Kindle version. Very poor job scanning and optimizing pictures. Any beginner photoshop student could have done a better job.
0, Memory for my Dell laptop: I added this card and every time I boot I get a new error message. I tried removing the existing 128 and just added the new one but the laptop didn't even start. Finally I returned it. I don't know whether it was a deffective piece or these just don't work with dell.
0, Seems pointless to even sell this: Every review I read said this didn't work in Dell laptops
0, Misrepresentation: What you see is not what you receive when you pay for it.Picture shows two items you will not receive:1. Iron penn tip.2. iron penn stand.Vendor do not answer for email.
1, Pretty Fun!: This game is overall a fun game
1, Excellent for enjoying your music/movies: I have this hooked up in my main living room
0, Poor Quality Sound - Poor Range: I purchased these to replace my old Advent wireless headphones
0, Waste of time: Its not simple and couldnt get the sound only noise tried every posiible channel and always noise never sound .
0, Poor Quality Product: The first set I ordered and received worked fine for 2 days
0, Sorry to have purchased.: First problem
0, Useless product: The headphones has a constant hiss. I tried them at different locations and on different channels. I had bought three and tested them all.A constant hiss can be heard at all times. I thought they would work like cellphones in a way where when there is no music
0," ""Stay Away: Stay away from these headphones. It uses very specific rechargeable batteries which do wear out and are extremely difficult to replace. Sony does not even stock them on its own website."
0, Popping noise: Just bought these yesterday and disappointed to hear popping noise every 30 sec. Headphones are good quality
1, Good but not great: I've had these headphones for about a month and a half and I really like this product. That being said
0, Disappointed: I purchased these on June 27th and
0, worthless junk: worthless junk - both before and after 'fully charging' [16 hours!] sound quality is terrible - overriding hiss and static on all 3 channels - plus controls are ridiculous - too tiny and flimsy to do anything while wearing them
0, unacceptable level of noise: The popping and clicking noise is unbearable. I'm very disappointed at this Sony product.So why do some people give five-star rating? They don't have this problem??? Or just can't trust some of the online reviews.
1, Good and useful: I use these to watch TV when family is asleep. It works well most of the time. Sometimes
0, 13 PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS MESS; 11 GAVE ONE STAR: AVERAGE 1.5 STARS?: Amazon should perhaps consider minus-star ratings. I hope I shall never see a worse movie. This mess lost me about 20 IQ points. Without a doubt
0," hotel condemned: The ""Special Features"" section said this movie had no script. That explains but doesn't excuse it."
1, We'll See How Hotel Stands the Test of Time: I saw this in the theater in 2001 and was quite....impressed? It made a big impression on me and overall I liked it for its audacity
1, Gret book for the kids!(Yeah right): This hooror novel teaches alot about the effects of teasing
1, Awsome!: This is an awsome book to read becuase it keeps you on the edge the whole time. Its about a young highschool girl who gets angrier and angrier everyday. All the kids at her school would do mean things to her all the time. They just kept getting worse. Little did she know she had telekinesis powers that could change the whole towns outlook forever. I can see why she did what she did. All the anger building up inside of her she was about to explode. Although it starts off a little slow
0, Eh...: I picked up this book
0, Disapointing: The story is good but the style of writing he used is boring. I loved the movie version of Carrie but the book really isn't like any other King work I've ever read. He has definately improved since this earily work!!
1, Carrie by: Stephen King: The book Carrie
1, Sure
0, Not his best work.....: This book Isn't as good as I would hope. It is to brief
1, Great Book!: I have to say that I was suprised by this book. It was my first time reading a Stephen King book
1, highschool hello: stephen king was brilliant in his first attempt at horror fiction if your a girl and can't feel the deep turmoil of carrie your not normal....king is exsplosive.
0, Nice Anecdotes: While it provides some nice insite it wasnt quite what I thought. It is mostly her impressions and story. nice read but just not what I thought
0, Don't waste your money: Ok so if you read my review on the actual detector
1, Touches the heart: This is a feel good movie. It is a regular Christmas movie that you can sit down and watch with children!
1, Thought I already reviewed this one.: But they say I didn't so I have nothing negative to say. If it's the right memory for your computer
1, heart warming and love expressions as a common theme.: Ms. Newcomer has an excellent grasp of life and some of the things that we take for granted in our lives. She expresses these things in simple heart stirring lyrics and has made me a fan of hers after this 1st CD I have purchased. I am looking forward to many evenings snuggling with my wife in front of the fireplace and listening to Ms. Newcomer sing about life and what we may be missing. Hopefully other people will discover her too.
0, Disappointed: I read Cry Me A River as a book club reading
0, A Movie that NEVER Gets Going . .: Frankly
1, Great series
0, Classic Example of Why I'm afraid to spend money on Koontz: Don't get me wrong
0, Why are the nuts chasing?: This is a novel first published under a different name
1, thank you: Item is exactly as described by seller. Item is of good quality. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for such an item at a great price!
0, Vinyl Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros Rock Art and X Ray Style: Just a warning
1, Joe Strummer post Clash at his best: This album is a glorious fusion of heartfelt urban folk spiced with world grooves that maintains the anti-establishment grit and irreverance that makes Joe Strummer one of the best lyricists of our time. Arguably his best work outside of the Clash.
1, Expensive
0," Alluring Price. Kind of Works: There's a lot of product for the price and the cleaning cloth is really soft and strong. The cleaner gets off finger prints and the other little specs that get on the screen. The downside is that it actually does streak. The streaks aren't too ""heavy"" but there is a lot of them. I've tried it on both of my screens (Acer and Asus) several several times. You can get a little bit of the streaks off if you use a dry part of the cloth and wipe the screen over and over and OVER. Really disappointed after reading the reviews. I may return this product."
1, Works very good! No Complain: I Bought to clean my 52' Sony LCD TV and did as supposed to...Very good product
1, Funny and human.: I read this in college and laughed quite a bit
0, Disappointing: I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time
1, Good Reference.: This is really a great book to have on hand when lost for ideas. It is one of many that I use for reference during the homeschooling year. In order to supplement it I do strongly recommend:To the Shore of a Child's Ocean Part One: Homeschooling from Birth to Age Nine (see ArtisanPacificPublishing Website).To the Shore of a Child's Ocean Part One: Homeschooling from Birth to Age Nine (Volume 1)
1, A classic
1, A Must Read Book: This is an amazing book. I truly feel bad for people who did not understand it's depth. Many said it was boring until it came to the killing. There is so much wrong with that statement
0, Love the Book
1, No other book has impacted me as this one...: What I have learned in this book has directly and indirectly been used throughout many years. No other story has affected me like The Hiding Place. It has been such an encouragement; and how blessed I am to know about the ten Boom family and Corrie's testimony! Her books and videos have had a profound impact on me
1, Adding perpective to life's challenges: This book truly teaches that it is not important where you find yourself
0, Horrors fans only: Occasionally I watch a gross-out horror movie
0, I Did not like This Movie: Sometimes i think that people are given money just so that they can be weird-movie makers
1, AWESOME BLU RAY!!: I recieved Phenomena blu ray and I got to tell ya
1," good stuff: i saw this moons ago under the title ""creepers"". Anchor bay has done it again. The print looks great and sounds good. Speaking of sound"
1, simple and comprehensive discussion of a complex subject.: unabashedly Calvinist
0, Probably the closest you'll get to hardcore on her.: I had a friend show me this a while back and believe me this isn't hardcore or anything
0, Don't bother!: Boring video for a couple. All it is some girls stripping in front of the camera. No imagination. No story at all. Watched it once and threw it out.
0, If your a yuppie with a wallet deeper than the oceanitsgreat: Apple iPod is a total waist of money. No way is it worth more than 200 dollars. If you want a good mp3 player you can get one for less than 200. The Arthos 10gb studio jukebox holds 2x the standard capacity of the ipod 5 and costs 1/2 as much. Also the firewire is a pain in the behind its just more money you have to throw away. Get another brand that is designed for windows. The only thing i liked about it before i replaced it was the LCD with 6 lines that was hot. But that doesnt add up. Dont buy it save your money for something better.
0, JUNK: You can live with the clicking noise when it switches from PSTN to VOIP but you cannot live with the horrible noise and static on the VOIP line. It does not work with Yahoo Messenger either. Get something else!
1, Easy to read educational breeding book: Excellent read for a new breeder such as myself and a great value considering the cost of this book if bought new. My husband claims to never have read a book in his life
0, Hope you enjoy grinding.: Expect to grind for countless hours if you want to clear bosses. Each act contains six quests (often overlapping) and then a final act boss. The act quests are reasonably challenging without being too frustrating
0, Diablo 2 compatablity issues: I updated all my computers to Windows XP service pack 3. I tried play the game after a one year hiatus. the gamefreezes at the start of the level. I have no intentions of buying Diablo 3. It seems that blizzard is an inferiorcompany compared with the likes of Valve and the makers of the Call of Duty and Gears of War series
1, Awesome: What is really amazing is that just when you think you might be getting jaded with Diablo II (seems to take about three years) you go online and download descriptions of the kits that are available
1, Great: i'm a casual entomology student....this book was absolutely FASCINATING. I want to take some more ent. classes again!
0, don't buy this: Oh
1, Traffic grows up: Listening to old Traffic albums is a fun trip down memory lane--the big hits of the Dave Mason era have become period pieces of '60s pop that sound great
1, A good moral lesson to be found here: This was a touching book. I hope it encourages young girls who find themselves in this position to consider all the options. Any woman/girl who wants an abortion should be made to read this book.
1, A fabulous book.: This is one of the first books that I really couldn't put down. It was easy to read and had me spellbound from the moment I started reading. It tugged at the heart strings and brought a tear to my eye in some parts. Eventhough it was set in 1952 in may ways it could still happen today. A story I won't soon forget.
0, 'Love' appears more than necessary.: I just finished this book
0, Grinnell IS in Iowa!: This is the first Danielle Steel book I have read
1, Good information: My son needed accurate information regarding his rights to see his son. This book has the answers he needs to move forward.
0, Court Is Not Where We Want To End Up: We have watched others follow this advice and then with all their good efforts still lose. We need more input into the process. Finding and trusting a good attorney just isn't enough. We are going to keep looking.
1, Nice read: Simple and enjoyable book . Great description of Botswana. Not super thrilling or complex
1," Great For kids who already know letters!: I am a nanny for two preschoolers: one 4.5 and one 5. They have letters and phonics down but making the transition to actually decoding words has not been easy. This video gives them a fun way to remember ""how"" to do it. It has great colors"
0, Save your money!: Parents will be forced to slog through weak character plots that move at a glacial pace. Once Junior
1," Great learning movie: My 3 1/2 year old is learning to spell. He is a graduate of the Talking letters video which is a definite must before this video. He ""gets"" how to put the letters together to make words and has learned to sound out words. His only problem is just like the machine in the video...he trys to make words that are not real...like ZAT. It gets going a little too fast towards the end of the video. They should have made it a longer video instead of rushing through concepts."
1, Leapfrog is why my son knows his letters and sounds...: Letter Factory
1, Awesome!: My daughter loves this video and also the Letter Factory video. At the age of 3 she had learned almost all of the alphabet
1, lyrical jazz trumpet reaches the sky: woody shaw
0, Alien 3 ends a run of two great movies: Alien 3 is a huge disappointment. While this movie was in its pre-production and production phases it was obvious that it was going to be a disaster - there was no direction or vision of the logical next steps in the Alien franchise. The first two movies were amazing - both unique and entertaining in their own way. Alien 3 begins with ruining everything Ripley fought for in Aliens by immediately killing off the survivors and then transitions into a bleak and dull storyline that trashes the franchise. I always envisioned subsequent Alien movies to delve into the mystery of the derelict ship on LV-426 and create a situation where Earth had to be defended from infestation from the Aliens. I would not recommend this movie to anyone
0, Grim and Masochistic: Director Fincher takes his death fetish to new lows in this grim and mostly pointless followup to Aliens. In this one
1, Largely Underappreciated: Though it's not really fitting for a movie in the Alien series
1, Satisfying
0, Not a continued Excellence...: With Alien and Aliens being such exemplary filmwork
1, Best Alien movie: I always thought Alien and especially Aliens were great movies. When I saw Alien 3 for the first time
1, Fast moving
1, Not his best
0, A one star rating is too high.: I should by have paid attention to the rating 'What A Waste Of Time
0, Once again
0, BIG BAD BOOK: This is the last book i will read from James Patterson .I was glad the book was on loan and i didn't have to pay .Don't waste your time with the latest addition of Alex Cross.If you like a book that starts half a page down or ends at half a page up than this is the book for you and i alsolike the way Patterson doesnt finish the book
0, Way too shallow!: After the total fiasco of The Lake House
0, not your vintage patterson: this is a disappointing book. gets all mushy with alex cross joining the FBI etc. i am used to fast paced thrillers from patterson
0," Such a disappointment: I am a big fan of Jame Patterson's Alex Cross series and was hooked from reading ""Kiss the Girls"". However I am getting tired of them ... almost as tired as his plotlines. This novel had no real ending (I am presuming that this is to encourage us the read the next novel) and I certainly did not get as involved with this story as with previous ones.Alex Cross' situation has developed slightly"
0," The Worst Author I Have Ever Read: Patterson's writing is an insult to one's intelligence. I couldn't finish this book (a Christmas gift) it was so bad. The fact that he is a ""bestselling author"" is proof of the dumbing down of American society."
1, big bad wolf: i loved this book
0, Carmen ripoff: I was under the impression that I had ordered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego--the original version. What I got was a terrible version. My son and I played it for 5 minutes thinking it was the version we had rented from the library but it wasn't--it was horrible--graphics-wise and content. I can't tell you how disappointed I was!
1, A favorite of mine for years: I'm so glad to see it's been released on CD! Redpath has such a versatile voice
1, excellent new edition of Hind Swaraj: This excellent new edition of Hind Swaraj fulfills the needs of all readers
0, Ok: This movie is a bit boring
1, Morality for beautiful girls No. 1 ladies detective agency book 3: This is a wonderful story/book. As you can see it is No. 3 in the series of books by Alex. McCall Smith
1, Hanson Similarity: I think gameface is a _really_ good band
1, Quality and Convenience in One: After listening to both the in-motion speakers and Tivoli's iPal
0, Missing features
0, Stick to the originals: Come on...the voices are in the background and the music is in the front. It should be the other way around. I like it when they remix songs but I like the singer to sound like they recorded it that way
1, The best MP3 player money can buy: As of this month
1, two great albums: Both these albums
1, Superb
0, What a waste of time!: I keep hoping that this book would go somewhere or at leaste give you something to think about. A best a poorly written unimaginative and already done many times story.
0, Ideas running out !!!: After I read 2061
0, Not worth the wait...: I grew up on Clarke. His novels and short stories fuelled my avid interest in science
1, Remember...: Just a note to you who compare 3001 to 2001. Clarke based the last 3 books of the series off the movie
1, 3001: The Final Frontier for Mankind: In 3001: The Final Odyssey
0, Lacks the real science---and the sound thinking---we expect: Generally pretty lame
0," What a mess....: Now what?...3001 makes it clear that Clarke is writing onreputation alone now. The story does nothing to further the ""adventures"" of HAL and Bowman--just the inflated ego of the author. Clarke has managed to give us no answers"
0, Oh brother...: After reading 2061
0, What a Cop Out!: Bringing Frank back was a great idea. The rest was crap. I can't believe that it would all end this way! ACC has got to be senile. This has none of the mystery or beauty of 2001
0, Ugh: If you want scifi go elsewhere. If you want an arrogant polemic then this is your book. What a waste of time (pun fully intended).
0, Have I missed something?: I have read this book several times now and still feel like I have missed something. I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out. It has so much potential to draw you in but never quite gets you going like the other three... 2001
1, Super Fresh High Quality: Very reasonable price for an awesome product. Super Fresh and aromatic
0, Cute concept - horrible implementation!: This is such a great idea for a Strawberry Shortcake toy! Too bad it's really poorly constructed. My 4-year-old calls me up to put it back together at least three times before she finally gives up playing with it.The fences constantly pull apart
0, JUNK: Please listen to the other reviews and don't waste your money on this stable. I agree with the other reviews when they say it is the most poorly made Strawberry Shortcake toy on the market. Trust me
0, Having a Garage Sale: Stop ! This may look cute
0," Lame Attempt!: BOOOOOOO!!! This is bogus! And the worst part is this guy duped the trademark office into granting him the trademark to ""Powerhour."" You should be ashamed of yourself Steve Roose. You are a sleezeball and a crook! Hey I'm going to trademark the term video and sue you for making a video"
0," More like ""Weak Hour"": Thankfully I received this DVD as a gift and didn't waste my own money on it. It's boring and doesn't even have music in the background...my friends and I actually ended up playing an audio power hour in the background while watching the DVD"
0, Wow
0, Terrible!: Power hours have probably been around since the first university was built
0," Can't stand grammatical errors: Who does a power hour power point presentation? The final screen says ""Congratulations Your Drunk!"" YOUR? It's YOU'RE"
0, Disgusting: Having watched this video there are far more comprehensive games out there. Googling will get you free versions...or better yet
0, Not for running or jogging!: If what you want is a portable device to run or jog with
0, Nope
0, Hollywood script version of the book I wanted to read: The software technology was unnecessarily anthropomorphic and silly
1," Dead Man's Treasure is a treasury of humor: An expiring British agent mails an invitation to Steed to a treasure hunt. The middle aged party giver of the car race admires Emma. ""What a beauty"
0, Well
0, Canon flash: I purchased this for my new Canon S3 IS. Worked great the first time I used it (as a bounce flash). I put it in my camera case
1, A Must Have for ALL Canon Digital Camera Owners: If you own one of the fantastic
1, Handy addition: Being an old-time fan of bounce flashing
1, no complaints: $100.....maybe a little steep
1, Solid: I agree with Dean
0, Not good. Not good at all.: I used to be a huge fan of the Cardigans. I even liked Gran Turismo's darker direction. But this....this is nothing. It's completely uninspired
1, THIS IS ALBUM IS MANSONS BEST YET.: I Tell You One tHing If You Are A True Manson Fan
1, Awesome!!: This album is totally awesome! All the songs are good and have a good rythm to them! But ever since Twiggy Ramirez left it'll never be the same! He has been with the band since the beginning! Tim Skold is ok
0, Good Music To Sleep To: Okay
0, big prob
0, his worst: Absolutely the worst album of Marilyn Manson. I am a big fan of his music but I must say that. Buy this CD only if you need it desperately for your MM collection. It contains only a few not bad songs like (s)aint
0, Just buy it in the store...: I have previously ordered a 16pc. set from Amazon last year and it shipped and arrived in perfect condition! However
1, Monkey Dance on Wiggles Yummy Yummy: I would just like to tell everyone who is bashing this video because The Monkey Dance is not on here that they are watching the wrong video. The Monkey Dance is on Wiggles - Yummy Yummy. As for this one
1, The classic Wiggle Time!: We have had Wiggle Time on VHS for 10 years
1, Your little one's gonna loooooove it!: I'm totally satisfied with this dvd. I bought several wiggles at a time. and this! this is the one of best dvd to me and my little girl(22 mos old). 'Rock-a-bye your bear'
0," Not Lisa Papineau's Pet: Don't make the same mistake i did. Even though this ""band"" is named Pet. It isn't the same band that sang ""Lil Boots"". This ""Pet"" is a horrible britpop male fronted band not fit to shine Lisa Papineau's boots. This cd is dated 2004"
1," Quirky and Delightful: ""The Artful Egg"" is one of the very entertaining books in McClure's unique Kramer & Zondi series. These novels revolve around the exploits of two irreverent South African police detectives"
0, I am disappointed: I feel nothing but disappointed...I was expecting to watch some essences of Academy Award show for last 30 years
0, Meh...: As somewhat of an Oscar historian
1, Great knife: I work in a large format print shop and have one of these in my hands for several hours a day cutting through all kinds of different substrates and materials. This knife if extremely durable and well built. I've owned several big name brand knives that were similar
1, Another great one!: Love that Doc Ford character! This story kept a steady
1, Product as described: I like this product. Fast shipment. The Scrimshaw Ship emblem is very nice. Due to the slight movement of the lid I could not gave a 5 stars.
1, great source of gay worship material: If you are a Unitarian Universalist minister
1, OK
1, This is a kooky video but your kids will probably love it.: My three-year-old daughter loves this video and asks to watch it over and over. Although most adults think the Monkey Dance is the best song
1, Wow!!! I became a Wiggles fan! Puppets are great!: This is the first Wiggles DVD I got for my 28 month twin sons. We heard of Wiggles before

1, Les Miserables 25th Anniversary DVD: This is absolutely wonderful! The cast that performed did a very good job
1, Simply Beautiful: I had originally seen this DVD on PBS so I knew exactly what I was getting. I was enchanted with this DVD. Having seen the original theater production
1, Very good performances: For those who are new to LM
1, Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert: This is an EXCELLENT production! I saw it on PBS and had to have a copy for myself. The musical talent assembled is superb. I highly recommend it!
1, Wonderful masterpiece!: Never saw this musical. Recently I watched movie and then bought this Blue Ray DVD. I watched it immediately when got it yesterday and feel it is a wonderful masterpiece to keep for whole life. I'm thinking to buy more as gifts to the friends.Delivery is so fast. It only took one day. The DVD quality is very good. Thank you.
1, Pure Enjoyment: This is an incredible
1, The Very Best: This is the most wonderful tribute and concert that honors perhaps the best show that has ever been produced on Broadway. Do not miss this if you enjoyed the show - or even if you haven't seen the show.
0," Disappointing.: Get the 10th Anniversary Edition. Nick Jonas is really miscast. The audio mix on ""One Day More"" is inexcusably bad. Remember"
1, An excellent production
1, It ain't over 'til everybody sings: Simply wonderful version of the Victor Hugo classic. Small warning
0, ldefective CDs: lucy johnson--this CD was Completely blank
1, A Fun Show: :) I really enjoyed this show!!! I have to say that Alfie Boe as Val Jean was great. Though Nick Jonas seemed a little uncertain at times
1, the best musical: les miserable is the best musical concert in my humble opinion
1, Great Cord: Great cord
0, What Century Is This?: So I don't know if this concept is floated much in these types of reviews
0, not like the pic: this item is not at all like what is shown in the picture at all. my mom still put it down on the floor

0, The day trip-hop died...: People ordering this should know that Skye
1, this was the kind of sound that drew me to Morcheeba...in the first place: All these poor reviews
0, This is the last one i purchase of Morcheeba...: This is the last one i purchase of Morcheeba
1, Don't expect the same old Morcheeba: Don't expect the same old Morcheeba with this new CD. Yes
0, Skye's my limit: I was so excited that a new Morcheeba album was out that I didn't take the time to read any reviews. I was expecting Skye because why wouldn't you? She was not only the lead singer
1," The Flower Farmer is complete: Lynn Byczynski's book is terrific! It has all the information that you need to pursue a career as a flower farmer. It has given me the information that I was seeking to make a career change and become a farmer's market flower grower. Especially appreciated the ""Source and references"" section."
0, Good marketing
0, It was not a leather band watch: The seller publish a leather band watch but it was a stainless steel band. When I has informed this mistake the seller has informed that it did not have the leather band model in stock and
1, Worth your $6.62: Certainly
1, Engaging little ones & peeking interest in letters and sounds: I am an educator and bought this video to help get my 2 1/2 year old interested in learning her letters. She loves to music and enjoys singing
1, Best way to introduce letter sounds to your child: I am loving this video. It is a great introduction to letter sounds. My daughter started with this when she turned three. We have bought all the dvds in the series. We used these in conjunction with Hooked on Phonics
1, awesome!!!: My daughter learned all of her letters and their sounds within 1 week. She loved the video and watched it over and over. She wants to play word games all the time now. I think even as a parent it is one of the least annoying videos to have playing in the background
0, Great Video: I purchased this DVD for my 22month and she loves this video. She watches in our vehicle on the way to daycare or where ever we go and she is mesmerized. She can now say all her letter and the sounds of the letters because of watching this video!! Thank you leap frog for this great video.. Would highly recommend.
1, The A says ahhhhhh: My class absolutely loves this video. We even sing the song during circle time along with flashcards. It is a great investment in a love and encouragement of learning and beginning reading. Way to go Leapfrog. I will be purchasing more of your products for my class.
1, LEAP FROG IS THE BEST LEARNING SYSTEM: I ALWAYS LOOK FOR LEAP FROG PRODUCT
0, Visually overstimulating
1, Excellent: Love this movie! My 3 yr old boy would watch this daily if we let him. Great learning tool!
1, Awesome video: My 2 year old loves this video. He was mesmorized the first time he saw it and insisted on watching it 3 times in a row. He already knew all of his letters
1, Great DVD!: My 2 year old son loves this video. He is currently in speech therapy because he was not talking much. Just in the past month his language has exploded and this DVD has taught him all of the letters and what sound they make. The repetitive use of the song and the visuals make learning fun and easy for a child of any age!
1," Great learning DVD: My two girls love this new DVD! My 4 year old knows all of the sounds of the letters in the alphabet within only a few times of watching it. My 2 year old is learning too & ask for ""froggy"" movie by name. This DVD has been a great purchase for us!"
1, most pain free way to learn sounds of the alphabet : ): I got this DVD for my son's 3rd birthday and he loves it. He watches it over and over again and now I'm proud to say that he's learned all his sounds.
1, Love this DVD: Great DVD! My 2 1/2 year old daughter is really into the ABC's and loves this DVD. It helps reinforce letter sounds I have taught her.
1, The absolute best: I absolutely love this DVD and cannot say enough about it. I've spent hundreds of dollars on toys
1, ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS!!!!!!: My son is 20 months and has been watching The Letter Factory for 3 weeks now and yesterday he went through his entire alphabet book and named each letter except 2 of them for which he only gave the sounds that they make. This DVD is absolutely wonderful!
1, Good ScreenSaver: It served its uses until I lost it. Was hoping for a future version where you can somehow attach it to your computer so that you won't forget it when packing up etc.
0, Duped!: I bought this DVD because it had what looked like a History Channel logo on the front and as such I assumed it was another one of their outstandings series. Boy was I wrong! It's a series from the 50s or 60s with lame graphics and commentary. It has decent real-life video
0, Good scholarship
1, Works great
1, Great ideas: Very helpful
0, Cheaply made: The belt is cheaply made with a very thin leather vineer over a fiber composit core. It will not hold up. The buckle slot was not cut as shown in photo.
0, Get what you pay for: I bought this for a Halloween costume
0, False advertising: The description says 100% leather. I was so shocked at how cheap it felt that I cut it in two to see what it was made of. It's a layer less than a millimeter thick of what is probably faux leather. The rest of the thickness of the belt is something that looks like compressed dryer lint. It includes tiny pieces of colored thread and I even found a shred of silver mylar. THIS BELT IS LITERALLY MADE OF TRASH.Also
0, Basic Belt
0, not bad: this belt seems to be cheep and the clasp seems to undo easier than I think it should. at time my buckle falls off. had to get a better one
1, Simply Beautiful: This lamp is just beautiful. I bout 2 of them for behind my sofa and they make the room even more gorgeous. The quality is very good. The only problem I have is with the lamp shades not staying straight/even but it's not that big of a deal
1, Inspirational & different.: Guidance to not only healthier lifestyle
0, Hal Lindsey could have ghost written this: I read the book and find it to be intellectually dishonest. After a bit of research I found that I wasn't alone.
0, Memory upgrade: We bought these to upgrade a couple of older Dell computers... waste of money. The computers would not address the memory and caused nothing but grief!
0, Clumsy: Lousy movie. Almost as bad as Lost in Space. I found it very amateurish - particularly the unsubtle operatic opening - and sunk with the weight of its own pretensions. I was a big De Niro fan after Godfather 2 and he's probably the only interesting thing about this movie. But I couldn't stand the little guy who swears a lot. Watching this movie was like being hit in the head repeatedly with a sock full of vomit. If it's a good boxing movie you're after try Fat City. Guaranteed no pretensions. And no overeating.
0, I did like the special feature disk: Deniro is one of the best actors of all time. Most all of Scorcese's films are jewels. But...I couldn't get through this film in one sitting. An overdose. The script seemed ad-libed and overfull. It was boring. It was depressing from start to finish with no sense of salvation for any of the characters
1, Amazing: This one of my favorite movies. This movie proves that Robert De Niro is the greatest actor of all time. If you are a movie fan and you haven't seen this movie you are a f***in' moron like Joey would say. I give it 10 stars if I could
1, Why is this out of print!????: One of the greatest movies ever made is no longer available on DVD. Hopefully it will be re-released sometime soon
1, Excellent!: This is more than a 'sports' movie. Robert De Niro's Oscar performance as Jake LaMotta is still one of the best movies made. Scorsese helped bring out a very human side of a temperamental boxer who can't keep it together. The trouble in his personal life soon spills over into the ring. Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also give wonderful talent to this story. The crumbling relationship between the brothers is especially heartbreaking when we realize Joey seems to be the last thin thread keeping LaMotta from unraveling. When that thread is lost

0, noisy and important: a noisy little thing
0, Didn't give me much guidance: I was really disappointed with this book. It was basically a psychology book masquerading as an advice book.I already have a very good idea why the toxic people around me behave as they do
0, Disaster: The cap came broke
1, Berzerk Fury ultimate X: Out of all the zoids I have (thirty or so)the Berzerk fury is my second favorite (next to Geno breaker)I like it's size
1, This is truly the ultimate X: Though its eyes doesn't light-up like the Geno-Breaker or roar like Liger 0(uncertain on both info.)its still the best zoid. You would be busy for quite a while building it
1, A very chalenging zoid: This was the most chalenging zoid for me to build. It might take you a long time to finish it but it is still a lot of fun to build and after it is finished. You will lose your mind when you can't get the bottom jaw part to stay together( I know I did). Here's a tip; if you are new at building zoids
1, blahblahblah: this zoid was very hard to biuld but well worth itit has 2 modes1)is walking mode it walks just like a regular zoid and its tail moves2)ion gun mode when u put it in this mode the vents on the tail open up and the head straitens and the barrel comes out of its mouthits a very cool zoid and i would recomend getting it
1," Get ""Early"" Before It's Too Late: Phil Woods' ""Early Quintets"" features selections from two different sessions"
0, very diappointed: The author expresses his oppinion about preachers and teachers from the beginning of the book however he doesn't seem to distinguish that it is men only who are called to be preachers and teachers therefore a person who believes this idea has a cheap ideal of christ and his headship and between male and female which is a shame.
1, Excellent book for beginning preachers: This is an excellent book for any man who is interested in preaching the word of God accurately to the church. The simple structure that Robinson brings to the reader is easy to understand and a wonderful method of sermon preparation and communication.
1, Traditional Sermon-Preparation Revisited: Haddon Robinson presents one of the evangelical classics on preaching. The work represents the sum total of the traditional methods of homiletics and does it in a manner that will resonate with many expository preachers. For the most part
0, One of the Worst Books I ever read: What happend to the wonderful characters of Midnight like the Lady Chablis it appears Mr. Berendt is truly ONE HIT WONDER....What shame....I think his luck has run dry...Perhaps the Lady was his lucky charm
0, NOT - Midnight in the Graden of Good and Evil: The premise of the book is good. But - Berendt fails to pull off the the connecting of rich characters around a central theme he did so successfully with Midnight. The book lacks continuity and lacks a beginning a middle and an end. One gets the impression that he took the template of Midnight and trys to fit Angels within the same format. He does not pull it off. The book is not quite a travel log
0, Another City - no angels: It just didn't do it for me. Like so many other people
1, from a Venice lover: I anxiously awaited this book because The Garden of Good & Evil was a blast and had such a wonderful flow. This one feels a little clumsier and contrived but since Venice is one of my favorite cities
0," Audio Book: John Berendt is a wonderful writer. It is a damn shame that a wonderful reader could not be found to perform the audio book version of ""The City of Falling Angels"". Holter Graham (the reader) has a breathy"
0," A Venice Root Canal: The author's more famous ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" is a great accomplishment"
0, Meandering.: Meandering but not in the same interesting way of the Venetian alleyways. Sorry
1, Still the definitive work: Backed into finding out about this book through the reference section in a Hemisynch/Holosynch Brain entrainment audio article. This is a great reference even though it is over twenty years since the last printing. I have just ordered another copy to ensure that I'll always have one around for reference. Superb job of covering the material. Yes the pictures are dated but
0, died: bought the kettle about 6 months ago. It served me well and i really liked it only after those 6 months
1, a nice electric kettle: I bought this kettle a month ago
1, Works Great: Hi. Got this item for my kitchen and thought I would use it on the metal panel over my stove since so many of the reviews stated it doesn't hold on textured refrigerators (which I have). I found out the back of my stove is plastic and not metal so I tried the fridge. It holds great. Not sure what all the comments about it falling off a textured fridge are about but in my experience it holds nice and strong. I love it.
0, A piece of Junk: The unit skipped (screeching sounds) with brand new mp3's disks from day one. I had the unit serviced and the problem still remains. The problem is not the disks
1, mother/child necklace: Every mother needs a cameo of their child. It makes a great gift for a new mother. The quality of this product is very good.
1, Darn: compelling argument. Some other guy named Shakespeare wrote all that stuff but NOT the Shakespeare we know (or actually dont)
0, Don't waste your time: It's a miracle I finished watching this movie. This movie had so much potential to be such a heart wrenching tear jerker
1, Agatha Christie fan: I am a Agatha Christie fan and I am starting to replace books lost years ago in a flood.
0, poor quality: The books looks so so for dummeis who just starts creating web pages. Unfortunately it fails to deal with the major issues on dhtml. There are better materials online such as Danstein 
0, Stay clear of this one.: The following review refers to the 30th anniversary edition. I was expecting a lot from this edition
1, mike nelson rocks: we've all seen the movie and we all know colorization sucks
0, Sorry people
0, George Romero has caught Lucasitis: Jesus Christ George! How many times are you going to re-re-re-re-release this movie? Their are as many versions of this movie floating around as their are Friday the 13th episodes. Quadruple dipping must be a George thing.
1, Zombie Film Classic: Awesome movie! Arguably one of the best zombie films out there. This will make a great addition to your collection
1, Whew
0, The horror
0, Right off the Living Dead: I know this DVD sounds great from the description (added scenes
0, Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition): This is by far the best copy on dvd of this movie. I was tempted in the past to buy this version but hesitated until I read other reviews on your website and decided to purchase this version after reading the high reviews. Being a big George Romero fan
0, NO 3-D FILM HAS EVER WORKED FOR ME ON TV!: Ok so JAWS 3
0," A Mishap Of Horror: Do yourself a favor and just buy the Millenium Edition. I made the mistake of buying this for the 15 minutes of ""extra footage"
0, I couldn't get rid of this DVD fast enough!!!: This 30th Anniversary Edition is pathetic. New scenes were added
1, Total Immersion DVD: The visuals are very helpful. Along with the book
1, Swim made....easy!!!: I wondered why I would get so tired swimming
0, Somewhat disappointed: I was surprised with this movie. The animation is still beautiful like all of the Barbie movies and Elena is a good role model
1, Returned: I apparently ordered an incorrect size as the filter did not fit my car thus I returned it!
0, Don't Bother Buying this DVD: I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.
0, 2 minutes of Hexndrix: Theres hardly any Jimi Hendrix in this. I think except for the three songs theres maybe 2 full minutes of Hendrix on this. How sad
0, Very little Tom Hardy: I didn't like the movie and only bought it due to Tom Hardy being listed as an actor in the movie. He is lieterally in the movie for maybe 1 minute at most. Poor story
0, Too chatty; no data
1, Amazing creativity!: This is a wonderful story that is so full of hope and creativity that you find it hard to believe that it is a true story taking place in a country that you find it very hard to believe that this could happen that country!A testimony to man's ingenuity with many lessons that we could apply here in the USA today! A story of regeneration that makes our current efforts in this country to develop sustainability look feeble!
1, So soft and all mine: I haven't had to wash it yet so I don't know how it'll be after that. Right now it's SO soft and warm. I cannot wait till winter starts and I get to cuddle under it. It's a little luxury in a mom's life right now.
1, a little small for a queen: This is a very nice blanket
1, A Gift From Afar: Have you ever experienced something that impacts you so profoundly that you cannot even visualize the words to describe it? This book is one such thing. Its messages are so clear and powerful that it seems they are messages we have known since the beginning of our existence. The messages are universal and timeless. They seem to come from some other place. This is a book that finds you. It is given to you from a stranger or pulls you to it at the bookstore. What you learn from this book are the things you need when you need them most. When I let the world tear me down and I feel lost. This puts everything in focus once again. If you want to experience something magical or need to be lifted up
1, Life-changing: This book was so amazing. It has changed my life in such a positive way. My thought life is the biggest contributor to my quality of life and up until this book
1, Have read it 3 times in 3 days!: I just ordered this book and absolutely love it. I've read the book all the way through every day for the last 3 days (takes me about an hour). A little longer if you read it aloud
0, Is this the full version?: I was expecting a book
1, This is a GREAT book: I love this book. It's really thought provoking. Allen does a wonderful job of proferring his insights on the power of thought. This book is not very long and can be read EASILY. It's concentrated insight.
1, A Mental Refresher: The book is small
0, Don't buy this particular edition!: The one star has NOTHING to do with the content of this wonderful publication
1, An inspiration to every thinking man: Small enough to carry in your pocket. Short enough to thumb to favorite passages easily. Powerful enough to withstand time and hold its own as one of the greatest motivational books every printed. `As a Man Thinketh' is a book that's price and size may make you suspect
1," A wake-up call to just about everyone: ""As A Man Thinketh"" should be on everyone's Short List of Must Reads.Inspiring"
0, Not worth it: I found the book to be cute at first

1, My favorite romance to date!!: I read One Summer Night in 2 nights. I loved the characters and the tension between Jo and Kelly is delicious! The story is laugh out loud funny in places
1, Addicting: I have owned this book for two days and I have already read it twice. I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. last night reading this book
1, fantastic!!!: I love this book!! Absolutely a keeper!! The length of time it for the book to get to me was very short. I am very satisfied
1, Good movie minus the pornography: Let's just call it what it is
0, Recommend another book for novice: Dear fellow readers:I borrowed this book from a friend
0, This is the worst textboook I have ever read: This is literally the most useless text book I have ever encountered (and I really thought I had read the worst). It is COMPLETELY USELESS.It doesnt explain basic concepts and examples skip mutliple steps on their way to the solution. And by multiple I mean I cant follow them at all. Please
0, Donner Pass: I was just at Donner Pass. This movie is nothing like what really happened at Donner Pass
1, Definitely lives up to its name: So far I've only used these twice. Once for removing a splinter
0, should have returned these...: i should have returned these. i don't like them at all. i love this brand but don't like this version at all.
1, Mind the point!: Excellent for removing ingrown hairs. You have to be mindful of where you grab the hair though. If you grab too high
1, Its hard to find a great pair of working tweezers: These tweezers work great
1, best tweezers every: i absolutely love these tweezers. they are extremely sharp which allows for precision removal of splinters and ingrown hairs. i also use it for eyebrow grooming because the fine point allows for single lash removal. (helps prevent pulling out too many at a time and creating a disaster) I have just ordered my third pair of these tweezers because I can't live without them!as stated below
1, Frankenstein: This book was extremely difficult and hard to read-then I got past the first 5 pages. It was so interesting and really touching. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone! It really makes you think and it has a little bit of everything in it! I learned alot too. The only down side is that it was soo depressing! It really was! I would definitely recommend this book and don't be afraid to read this if you think it's too difficult
1," A review of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein."": We rate this book four star for a few reasons"
1, Interesting read: I read this novel as part of a personal challenge to read 100 top novels inspired by a friend's blog [...]. Frankenstein was the first book
1, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley: A great story about Frankenstein!I found it very interesting and easy to understand. It kept my interest and I felt compassion for Frankenstein. He did not asked to be created by Victor
1, The best classic: This was the best classic I ever read. It is SO much better than the movie. There were lots of boring parts. I was rushing through the book but when it was over I wanted to read it again.-reader
0, Reader beware your in for the dull trip of your life!: This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read. The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep. I had to read this for school and didn't think the beginng was so bad but then I hit the bad spot it was the worse thing I ever read. It has its good points but few of them. Just don't waste your time on this.
0, Kindle version of Frankenstein: I picked up this ebook for my Kindle
1, Pretty Good Work For A Teen-Ager: Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece
1," ""You break it"
1, An eye-opener: It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book
0, A doctor who creates a monster from dead people: This book is about a doctor who creates a monster from dead people. The monster walked around at night. The towns people were frightened because the monster was ugly and different from them. When the towns people chased him with a bat
0, It was a hard read: I got this on the Kindle. It's not an easy read
0, THE WRONG ITEM!!!!: I ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR A CLASS. AND WHEN I RECIEVED THE BOOK IT WAS THE WRONG VERSION WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY ADVERTISED AS THE CORRECT ITEM!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!
1, Its all good!!!: The book is good and I recommend people to read it. Make sure you read the introduction and preface; and also the Letters before you get to chapter one because if you don't you will get a bit confused in the story. The story was well written
1, 5 stars for all the SAT words: I recommend it to high school students seeking to improve vocabulary for the SAT. If you can read this book from cover to cover without looking up a single word in dictionary
0, Not brand new
0, not good: If I did not have to read this for school I never would have read it. It was an interesting story line but horribly and not understandably written and is one of the worst books I have read in a while.
1, You've seen Karloff
0, Waste of Money: I ordered this book while I was taking psychology in college
1, Great
1, I love this stuff: This is pricey but worth the money. It is light but penetrating. It has good staying power and
1, EXCELLENT: I highly recommend this seller! Item just as described and fast shipping!! A++++++++++++++ Mahaloz!!!
0, Awful: This book is chock full of arrogant
1, Great music but check out MOSE ALLISON SINGS: I've owned this CD for years
0, Quality is key: I wish I'd seen this site before I purchased this beloved classic. I wouldn't take this DVD from Alpha Video if they gave it away for free. They should be made to return the money of all who purchased it. I am sincere in stating that the picture/sound quality is less than a 3. The movie itself deserves so much better than this trash release. The one star I've given is only for the movie content(which itself is 5 star)
0, Tries but never gets off the ground.: First the film it's self. It just had too much to live up to. I always laugh a lot watching the first film. All involved were in top form. And were working from a great script. Grins are about all I get here. Everyone tries but the script is WEAK. Ms. Taylor was so beautiful that I enjoyed just watching her and Mr. Tracy was one of the VERY BEST there has ever been. But just that won't make up for the thin script. Now the DVD transfer. The color is so bad everything looks pastel when any color other than green can be decerned. I watched this on a home theatre system and the sound was nothing special but alright. On a regular t.v. it would be pretty sub-par.
0, don't buy Alpha Video products: I bought the movie Father's Little Dividend from Amazon made by Alpha Video. The picture was almost all bright light and the sound was terrible too. It was like a copy of a copy of a copy. I won't buy from Amazon again if I should receive another such poor quality product. I suggest to Amazon not to do business with Alpha Video.
0, BEWARE MADACY ENTERTAINMENT!!!: DO NOT buy this DVD. Another inferior product by Madacy: bleached out picture and tinny sound. Weren't DVD's supposed to be better quality than VHS?!?!
0, Bleh: How could she have gotten signed she can't carry on a tune if you want goot Brit Pop then buy STEPS they can actually sing. Don't buy this album ever. I regret that I did.
0, Dissapointed: I was SO dissapointed recieving my new Swan Lake DVD; a HD DVD....I have no HD DVD player and I did not notice that is was a HD movie......I really suggest that Amazon warn about the format - HD....who has a HD DVD player these days???
0, Another excellent book whose Kindle version is terrible!: I have had a copy of this book since I was 16. I have given it as gifts
0, Stopped working after a few plays...: Now granted we did get this used but the reason we bought it was bc my boyfriends game had stopped working. Then when he started playing this one it did the same thing. It must be in how they made the game bc it has happened with several.
1, *Kelly is the best!*: I LOVE this CD! This is Kelly at her best! She is beautiful
1," Very Thankful!!: This CD is awesome. I was a little apprehensive wondering if we would end up with a CD full of ""A moment like this"" songs or not (not that I'm knocking that song either cause I liked it too). Kelly has an amazing vocal range and an ability to real you into her songs and style. Although the CD does jump around from Pop"
0, okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!: okay.....umm....this is beyond bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well when I thought things couldn't get worst. Now we have listen to a solos cd by the world's dumdest fake brunette. I've never liked Kelly Clarkson(then
1, Thankful: I was very suprised by the ecclectic mix of styles on this album. From sultry to bluesy
0, Sick of R&B and Rap: I was expecting more in line of A Moment Like This - it was all R&B and Rap.Save your moneyDon't buy it.
0, Overrated: Kelly Clarkson is overrated. Sure
0," Not good!: Is this music screaming or singing? I am very unimpressed by her debut album. She has a fantastic voice and doesn't need to scream her lyrics. I would suggest she try to do less ""hip hop"" type music and more ballads. They better suit her voice. Overall"
1, Thank God for American Idol!!: If it weren't for that show (that I hardly watch)
1, This is why Kelly Won: Awesome cd. Well worth the wait. Nice mix of ballads and rock. Great duet on rocking song with fellow Idol Tamyra Gray. This is one cd you will want to keep in rotation on your player
0, Maybe the worst CD of all time: It is very sad indeed that this is what the world of music has come to. Take an overweight
0, Breakaway is a lot better: This album is almost completely different than Kelly's second C.D.
1, Kelly Clarkson is so tight!: Her new song is sooo good. It's growing on me alot. I didn't here every song on the cd but I heard 3 and they were great. Go get this CD now
0, Beautiful voice
0, visitor: I was really expecting a great cd. I heard Miss Independent and was really looking forward to the rest of the cd. If I want that type of quality for a whole cd
1, Evil chickens will someday rule the world: Kelly Clarkskson is awesome. She is one of my favorite singers. She has a really good voice.
1, Good CD: Over all I thought that this cd isn't that bad. Personally I think the best songs on this cd are The Trouble With Love
1, Sensational !!: THANKFUL
0, Diva-in-training needs better material: A year in the making and dozens of producers and songwriters. The result is entirely mediocre. Granted

0, Bad design
0, Timeouts on remote connections: Longtime Amazon customer but this is the first time I have ever been driven to write a review.This product was a huge disappointment after upgrading from my old Netgear RT314.The problem? It times out my remote connections after about 15 minutes.. So I might be SSH'd into a remote system (work) doing some work.. Step away for a few minutes or get distracted and Bam.. Lost connection. And here I thought I had 'always on' internet. The old Netgear would stay logged in for days.I contacted 3COM customer support (a very lengthy endeavor) and they told me it was 'designed to do that'. A quick search will show a lot of people who have this problem.It will be many years before I buy another 3COM product.
1, True story: Tony is a story teller. This album is some of his best songmanship. It is a shame that the album is so hard to find on CD.
1, Good
0, Poor Construction: We purchased this Pill Organizer after using the same type for a few years. The last one lasted a few years
0, Don't Waste Your $: I bought this frame because I could get pictures off of my computer and put them on it. I did this and that was easy. The problem with this frame is that after about 6 months it started having color issues and the pictures were turning pink and distorted. At 7 months it completely stopped working. It has a 6 month warranty and therefore
1, Digital photo frame: I am well please with the Westinghouse 7 inch LCD photo frame. I've checked out other products and found that the color quality and clarity was better than almost all the others. The internal memory
0, worst product ever.: Purchased two frames as a Christmas gifts. Could not load pictures via usb cable. Tried loading off a memory card
0, Ouch!: These headphones may be convenient and deliver adequate sound
0, Great sound
0, Left Headphone Goes Out After a Few Months: Like so many others here
1, great sound and comfort!: I have always preferred the vertical in-the-ear style headphones since they were first introduced in the late 80's. These headphones are very comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. You will barely feel them. That's great
0, Brakes easy: The plastic hindge at the top of the fold broke after about 3 months of use. The good sound quality is of no use if the item is broken!
0, already broken: They fit well and had good sound quality but broke in half within a couple of weeks. My husband was just putting them on his head and they snapped in half. We were very disappointed.
0, Good until they broke: These headphones have great sound and they stay on your head.Downside - 1. Sweatguard doesn't work well 2. One side broke after a couple weeks.
0, gone through 3 pairs... and will not buy again!: I have owned three pairs of these headphones and do not plan to buy another pair. They have a great fit and good sound but the ear buds short out after 6 months to a year. Unforunately
0, Painful: I'm a ridiculous headphone snob
0," Oddly fragile for a ""sporty"" headphone: I've gone through 2 pair of these. I like the design and the fit of them even though I'm not a fan of in the ear/bud earphones.However - the headset portion that folds and fits over the head is made of the most brittle plastic I've ever had on a pair of headphones. I thought the first break was a fluke. The second pair died as the first - to a break in the plastic that fits over the head as I was putting them on.Careful as you may be - these WILL break."
0, Breaks easily: I owned these headphones for about 3 months & absolutely loved it. I used it while working out & it fit perfectly. Good sound; felt comfortable in the ears; & quite compact. But as others have noted; it snapped in 2 pieces at the joints. Would not recommend these.
0, Defective Product: The earphones are defective. Only one side works. It took a while to recieve the product and the product was defective. Not a good buy.
0, until they break!: I have owned more pairs of these folding headphones because of comfort & sound quality but durable they are NOT!!! go for modelW25 instead
0, Junk! Cheap flimsy hinges lasted less than a week!: Do NOT buy these. I bought a pair and the hinge snapped in less than a week. I thought maybe I had a defective pair or I had been too clumsy
0, breaks too easily: I went through two of these very quickly. It's a shame
0," Broken in 3 weeks: I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones. The yellow ones were kind of ""rubbery"" and I've had them for years. These broke within 3 weeks. And not under great stress or high use"
0, Nice sound and comfortable but they broke: I owned these less than 3 months
0, Used to be good - now brittle and super cheap: I've had the same experience as some of the other reviewers here. I've had 2 pairs break in the EXACT same spot in the last 3 weeks. I will NEVER BUY Sony again. It's hard to believe the quality has declined so badly.
0, Disappointing: I read this book to learn the motives of those who risked themselves to shelter Jews in WW2 (a valuable subject) but was sadly disapointed. It's as readable (and interesting) as a telephone book.Try Browning
1, Classic in corporate law: This book has been a classic in legal literature since it was first published. It is amazing how current and up to date it is! If you are studying the inner workings of the corporations this is the book to buy!
1, Very Good Book: I would have to rate this book as a good read. It shows the many challenges young women face in relationships. How one can go through many trying situations and still find their strength in God to make it through. Of course

1, Intriguing: This was my first Clive Cussler book. I didn't realize that I was jumping into the 15th or 16th book in the series. I can't wait to go back and read the previous ones. This book combines ancient history and adventure
0, If you enjoy 1940s comic books
1, The Grandmaster Delivers in Spades!: I picked this book up and could not put it down! What a blend of myth and adventure. Pairing our beloved Dirk and Atlantis was a stroke of pure genius. In the opening adventure sequence I found myself holding my breath just like the unfortunate three in the chamber. Only Dirk could make an entrance like that.Our favorite characters are all back and we realise how much we missed them. Al gets a girl of his own and Loren realises she might be missing something.The great classic car is a dream. Wouldn't we all love the chance to be behind the wheel?The bad guys are guys and girls that we really can hate with a vengence. The incredible odds just keep coming at our heroes and they never give up!All in all just what a Cussler book should be!
1, dirk rules!: dirk rules! i don't care if my hubby gives me a hard time about loving dirk pitt--and this new story is great. i didn't think i would find another pitt novel as exciting as my favorite (inca gold)
0, Atlantis Found Awful!: Never been moved to write a review in many years of reading
1, Excellently written by a GREAT person: I recommend this book to everyone. Even non-poets who are looking to expand their creativity. This book is more than poetry
1, Does the job for a great price on 1996: Got this for my 1996 GT Mustang. I wanted to protect my original steering wheel while it still has no cracks or damage
1, The stars make the movie: All i got to say is this: If u have any doubts of how real this movie is brought to life just look at the list of actress' and actors' that performed in this beautifully written movie. As I was scrolling down the list there were certain names that stuck in my head. The people that performed in that movie are now basically STARS. Need proof? here it is. Roma Downey: Jackie Kennedy. Can u say STAR? she STARS in one of the most popular TV series to date. Stephan Collins:JFK he STARS in another greatly popular TV series. Now

1," A great Cal Tjader album: I wanted ""Cal Tjader's Concert By the Sea"" to be released on CD so badly. I have been enjoying my LP copy of this album (Fantasy 3295) for several years. We can all rejoice that some of the best Tjader Fantasy albums are now being reissued. And what a bonus that the trend seems to be putting the contents of two LP releases on one CD. If you buy Blackhawk Nights"
0, Fun while it lasted: Had it two years
0, Great except the constant buzzing noise.: Good picture quality
0, NOT compatible with Macs: After purchasing this frame we found out it is not compatible with Macs. There is nothing in the literature to forewarn someone of this. Looks like it would be a good product if it supported Macs.
0, Unusuable after a few months
1, A thoroughly enjoyable read!: This may be the first novel for Alafair (I love that name!) Burke
0, Terminally putrid: Ms. Burke should apologize to the souls of the trees that gave their lives for this pap. If 10% of what James Lee Burke has had rubbed off on this kid
1," Best: IMO this is way better than the V-necks from Calvin Klein and Polo. I bought all three kinds and then bought more Lofteez.The material is stronger and holds up better and the shirts are slightly LESS long. The Polo is thinnest (stretches after a few wears) and longest (probably good if you're over 6'2"").Much better thicker cotton in this shirt than the competition."
0," Quality of undershirt: Frankly I was disappointed with the quality of a ""Fruit of the Loom"" product. I expected a better texture. Guess that's what one should expect of imported goods. My bad I guess........."
1, Page Turner!: I just finished this on my Kindle - read it everywhere: in the subway
1, excelente: excelente very fast
1, Simple introduction to beginning massage for your dog: An amusing little book that is useful in helping the loving dog owner give and receive physical relaxation from their pet. It isn't a medical or chiropractic guide to the canine but rather has humorous cartoons and three simple techniques to get started in massaging your dog. A conversation starter and an interesting inexpensive gift for the Holidays. Origins stores are featuring this @ list price with dog biscuits as a Christmas gift.
1, Typical Bay Area Music: This Summer I spent in the Bay Area around San Francisco. I Heard a lot of great Rap
0, WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO READ!!!: I could not finish this book. It was written like a really bad book report. This book should not have been published!!!
1, BETTER THAN AVERAGE.: I think vampies rock
1, good buy for florida's summer heat: I bought this canopy for my driveway in Florida... and it is very beneficial.. especially our pounding summer rays.. and summer rain.. i would recommend this product
1, All I want now to do or hear is poetry!: Rumi is brilliant in his acuteness. Birdsong only makes me want to learn and read more about this impressionable thinker. His words truly hold the essence of life. Recommneded to all who adore poetry.
1, Very nice collection of Rumi Poems!: I am a lover of birds and of Rumi as well. This book is nice and I keep it by my bedside. Very good buy.
1, A great study tool: The Exam Cram 2 - PMP Practice Question book by David Francis is a great study tool. David's book is an economical way to practice for the PMP exam. There are plenty of books out there that provide practice questions
0, Subpar: Many questions written poorly
0, Limited scope: Got a subscription for one free year when I subscribed to another magazine. If you're into sportbikes it's fine. If you're a cruiser rider you're all but forgotten.
1, HEAVY METAL EROTIC SPECIAL NO. 2: AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE THIS IN STOCK
0, My experience: I bought this a long time ago from k-mart and it didn't work to well with my hair. I had to set the heat to high and leave whatever tool I was using for a long time. It didn't really straighten or crimp my hair to well. It curled my hair fine but as I said I had to leave it there for a long time. Oh and it takes awhile to heat up. I reccommend finding a better brand possibly and not one that looks like a toy O_O
0, uuugghh: Could have bought this item at my local dollar store! Super cheap attachments that do not work well! The spiral curler doesnt spiral (and I have easy-curl hair that measures down to my butt) the curling iron itself is very cheaply designed
0, Does not perform: This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My daughter used her christmas gift card to buy this because she wanted to be able to crimp and curl her hair. The item does not heat up and it takes at least and hour just to crimp her hair. Wish I still had the original packaging so I could send it back. This product is a rip-off.
0, review: Its a nice price
0, Does not get hot enough: I got this to use it as a crimper. When I got it
0, yawn: I read this about 45 years ago. I was in my late teens. At the time
1, Truly chilling: This book is one of the most depressing books I've read
1, A little boring in some places
1," 4 slice toaster: We saw this on ""America's Test Kitchen"" and since we needed a new toaster"
1, Excellent Book: Great book for fans of Pynchon
0, Good but not History: For the person who likes reading book
0, O! What a Horrid Waste of Pulp

1, The Complete Guide to Buying
1, Comprehensive Guide - A Must for Horse Owners: This book is worth reading even if someone else is trailering your horse. Discusses options for trailers layout
0, not worth your time or effort: I recently took a course in hot stone therapy. Before I took the course
0, Definitely Not Patrick O'Brien: After reading Patrick O'Brien
1, Check your Operating System if your running 64bit
0, make up??? oh my god!!!!: this album makes me sick. if you think the cover is bad
1, Mickey: I was very pleased with the product and it arrived in a very timely manner. I was glad to find music that i had been unable to locate in a store.
1, Light Shmight: If you are going to purchase these cables I highly recommend getting the Black & Decker Cranial Expansion kit as well. I don't know what marketing genius came up with idea of selling the two separately but they should be bound in an iron shirt and flayed with a pumice stone
0, there is no 'i' in AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable: I'm sure this is a great product
0, A Classic Bait And Switch: What a piece of junk. I had a $20 wire roll from Radio Shack and another $14 sunk in banana plugs
0, Not actually terminated at K2: I ordered these hoping that they would be terminated atK2 (Adventure Press)so I could listen to theMusic of a Sherpa Village. Imagine my disappointment to find they terminated right in my living room. I guess the 8 foot length should have been a tip-off. They do go well with myWalker Edison Everest Multilevel Component Stand
0, DO NOT BUY: I picked up a set of these to connect my Coby walkman to a pair of Altec-Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers I have in the back of the Gremlin. Britney sounded pretty good
0, It is not a text book
1," Right on!: Gelernter knows his stuff. The other 99% don't have a clue. Read this one with Johnson's ""Interface Culture"""
0, Rambling and Naive: Caveat is I usually don't read this kind of fluff
0, Music Man: This CD-KC's greatest hits has about only 5 songs that were hits. The sound quality is poor. Sounds like the singing was recorded in a tin can. The songs sound like they were recorded in a low budget bar. It's all mono tone and parts are ad-lib singing
0, toooo much packaging!: I bought this product about a month ago and was really put off by the amount of unecessary packaging that comes with it. It's a huge box full of filler plastic- all for a little DVD game. The games were pretty fun but the packaging was a deterrance to that.
1, Very Simular to 1st Tombraider: This game is very similar to the first Tomb Raider I played on PS1 many years ago. It starts out in South America behind this large doors that shut. Has bats and a bear in a pit. Great graphics to make the game more enjoyable.How to use the Grappling Hook. I struggled the first day with this item in both games I purchased.Walk to the edge jump and just before you descend from the jump
0, For God Sakes
1, Overall a good game: Overall this was a good game
1, Traditional Blugrass with a Wild Band: I think this c.d. was awesome. There are a lot of the traditional songs played by some great musicians. The banjo player is out of this world
0, tiny and fragile: I bought this as a joke for a friend who appreciates the FSM web site. The keychain is very small and not particularly attractive. If it were about 50% larger
1, You Must Buy this Book!: If you have any interest whatsoever in learning the true occult science as taught by the ancient mystery schools
0, AVOID ANY PRODUCT BY SURROUND RECORDS ! ! !: Just look at some of the reviews for this or any of their other blu ray discs: about half are raves about how nice they sound....and the other half are from users complaining that the disc does not play in X player!I've now tested several discs with the latest firmware
0, Not worth the money: I bought three of this company's Blu-rays ... save your money and get the CD. Better yet
0, NOT POSSIBE - DIDN'T PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I bought this item from Newbury Comics and it didn't play in my PS3 or in SONY blu-ray player. I send a message from Newbury Comics asking what I can do
0, Item stopped working two weeks after receiving.: I have subscribe to XM for at least 15 years and enjoy it
0, not that into it: The only reason I have this movie is because my husband likes it. He is a fan of Steven Seagal. I tried to watch it last night
1, A great gift: My husband really liked this ebook that I purchased for him. He had wanted a better understanding of Jesus and His life from a perspective that didn't come off as preaching to him. This book achieved that.
1, Fun to read for kids and adults: A wonderful story with lovely prose. I enjoy reading it and the kids (2
0, Trashy and poorly written: Having fallen in love with Patrick O'Brian's work
1, must read: A great book. A must read for someone who likes historical fiction. The characters come alive and the action is plenty. I have the entire series and I've reread them at least 3-4 times. totally different from Hornblower. Only note a few adult scenes so I don't recommend for young readers
1, I Love
0," A few small delights - and a fistful of clangers: ""Very Best of""? OK"
0, What is this ?: I recieved this slide today and am not really impressed.Looks thicker on the web site.I play dobro and thought this might be easier.It sounds like chrome over tin.Its a waste of money.If you are new to slide guitar I wouldnt try this one.
0, Waste of time: Hmm
1," Magenta - Melodic Progressive Rock Concept Piece: ""Home"" is the latest album from Magenta which tells the story of an English immigrant moving to the U.S.A. The tale is told in linear fashion taking the main character through her move to this country and here experiences once here. It is probably the band's most ambitious work to date and in my opinion their best. The music continues in the lineage of Renaissance"
0, Waste of money: If I were able to give zero stars
0, If you plan on doing whole wheat toritllas...: don't count on this to do the trick. I put the dough in
0, Not so hot!: This was on the top of my Christmas list...I was so verydisappointed. This tortilla baker doesn't do much
1, No F-Lock: This is the most rugged wireless keyboard I have come across yet. Its range is amazing and best of all it does not have an F-Lock key. The mouse is very responsive and does not seem to eat batteries very fast.
0, Useable range is less than advertised: I attempted to use this product in my living room with my home media computer. I need about 7 to 8 feet of range from the USB dongle to the keyboard and mouse. This hardware was not capable of that range without issues with mouse response and key strokes dropping out. All bluetooth keyboards I have tried have worked well at this range. For some reason non-bluetooth wireless keyboards seem to have serious range issues and this one is no exception. Finally the mouse is somewhat narrow and uncomfortable for my hand. It would probably be good for light use but extended use causes my hand to cramp. The keyboard is well built but not as well as my Lenovo laptop keyboard.
0, Once again
1, The Best of its type -- a great gift: I found this to be a truly great book. However
1," A Must Have: I have enjoyed watching this DVD. It was great seeing the original 1968 line up performing together. The reditions of ""Wond'ring Aloud"" and ""Life Is A Long Song"" accompanied with the string quartet were awesome. The DVD has a good selection of old and new material. The performance of ""Budapest"" was superb and shows Tull at their best. The only drawback is that the DVD is not long enough. I would have enjoyed more concert footage and more interviews with the band members and fans. This DVD is a ""must have"" for Tull fans!"
0, The sound is pathetic.: I was so excited to get this dvd in the mail yesterday as I am a devoted Tull fan. I collected all the albums
0, Don't waste your money on this: Much is said about this DVD. I must admit that i am very dissapointed with it. For me a good concert DVD should be representative of what the concert was like. A concert from start to finish and not overproduced with cheap effects
0, I Couldn't Believe What I Was Hearing?: Well first of all
1," Arnold fills Barry's shoes nicely again: This CD is a lot of fun to listen to! It integrates the traditional 007 theme with high-charged ""spy"" music that works even when not paired wtih the film. Garbage breaks the streak of mediocre title songs with a real doozy--I think it helps that David Arnold understands how to provide music for a Bond movie. He's the John Barry for the next phase of the franchise"
0, Could Be Better: I thought the original 007 music was dull. Now I think I think I wasted my money on that CD
0, Worst Maiden ever: I hate to be critical of any band's releases
0, THis isn't even a CD ....: STEVE made such a horrible album
1, Blaze got power but not the style.: This is a dark album
0, Recorded
0, What was Steve Harris thinking?: First of all I am and will always be a huge maiden fan. I am also not a purist who thinks that Bruce is irreplaceable as great as he is
1, Norton Anthology of Western Literature
0, Never arrived.: Placed an order
0, Misleading picture: I agree with the reviews that say sizing is way off. It is tiny! Also
0, Like the original? I think not.: If you ever had one of these as a kid in the late 60's to early 70's
0, sacred hunger: One of the most difficult
0, Memorex DvD-RW did not work: My Canon DC100 would not write to these dvds. The disc came up as unreadable. I tried all three and was unsuccessful in recording or reading the disc on my Canon video camera.
0, junk: total never did any thing for me. a big waist of time money and space. i threw it away immediately.
1, Recommended: ...An inspirational book to me on my journey (and one of the single greatest cover photos in the history of publishing!).This wonderful book
1, Four Brothers is a 4 Star DVD: Four Brothers takes the drama to your TV. When I bought this movie I thought there was going to be more action in it but it was more of a thriller
1, Kinda Corny but entertaining: I liked all of the characters in the movie and it was a decent story line
0, Guns and that is all: All this movie was was guns and shooting and a hard to follow plot. If you like guns and blood
0, Lame and hard to take seriously: I'll be honest I never finished this movie. It was that bad. The trailer is great but this film was more group therapy than anything else. I like the idea of adopted children coming together to find their mother's killer. But it was weak. I think they spent most of their time playing ice hockey than anything else. I got rid of it but I think the main character tried using a gun to get the attention of everyone in the gymnasium. Nobody took him seriously
0, Waste of time: I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks
0, not worth watching: This views like a high school art movie
0, 3 Lads
1, Doors box not perfect
1, A Real Gift: Well here it is Valentines Day and I opened the box set. It was an inventive appraoch. But... We-( The Doors Fanatics ) want more! The graphic collage was admiribal. ( I must say the box suxs though ( needs to be a bit larger. Re-invention of the vinyl style is cool.Three things are missing here. 1. An American Prayer. 2. The lost songs I have on 8-track 3. A splif. If you are lost to what I said read the book. Other wise its a.. well nice job. Jim we all miss you! The End
0, disappointed: It is disappointing to see the fifth release of material on CD that has already been released on CD. It could have been made very much better. I am very disappointed
0, Delusions of granduer: Lizzie confuses candidness with insight. Her prose is stilted
1," OUTSTANDING!!!!: I cannot say enough about the little vehicles from the movie ""Cars"". We were lucky to purchase 8 of them the week before the movie released and I just purchased 2 more of the sets. I have heard the trouble in getting these little gems and I think it was supply/demand shortsightedness. My 5 year old son plays with the vehicles for hours and does not even want me to throw the packaging away! I can definitely say they are worth the money to buy. Hopefully"
0, not satisfied: this mouse was good at first
0, Disapointing - especially compared to the rest of the series: I have long been a fan of this series and I jumped at thechance to get the next game. I knew before hand that the graphicswould not be the best around
1, Should Have Read it in High School: I found this book to be ponderous and quite a bit less than the thriller it is touted to be. Although it was apparent the entire saga was going to take place in short period of time
1, A suspenseful story with surprises around every corner.: The ANDROMEDA STRAIN is one of Crichtons best. It is very exciting and makes you think about how scary being sick can be. It is about a small town called Peidmont in Arizona. A government satlelite lands there and is opened. Inside is an unknown terestrial virus from space. The virus is taken isolated and contained while the government biological wildfire project is executed. But the virus mutates and then the real danger starts. The ANDROMEDAN STRAIN is an interesting novel from the author of JURRASIC PARK.
1, This book is a masterpiece that will be remembered forever: A disabled satelite plumits to earth witha deadly disease inside. It lands in a town in Arizona
0, Cynosure Scallions on the Mountain Look Downwards (Upon?) the Zebus & Sevens: Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable.
0, Not that great: Since early about November of last year have been on a Crichton spree of sorts...and i can honestly say this is the worst Crichton novel i have read...the whole book is fairly boring...it is ALOT of scientific talk and not alot of action...but the ending is just not good at all...the ending left me wondering why i read that whole book...it is EXTREMELY anti-climactic...pretty much the only thing that kept this book out of the 1-star range for me was that i liked the idea...read if you want...i just dont like it
0, Disappointing: Information not clear that product MUST be bolted down to be of any use. Impossible to use without securing to work surface - tough if you have stone.Turned about 20% of meat to mush.Really disappointing. Can't recommend for anyone.
0," not happy with grinder: Upon receiving this grinder I discovered a part missing; should have two sized grinding hole attachments and only received one. Took me 5 days to receive a call back from the company to take care of my complaint. Was told the missing ""wheel"" would be sent to me. After several weeks I still have not received the part. Also the actual grining parts do not fit well. Would not recommend this to anyone. Am still waiting for the part."
0, very cheap: It was broke when I got it I was so mad I bought this for my grandma and it was broke when it arrived to her house.
0, Broke immediately: The meat grinder is plated and the plating began flaking off when we tried to use it the first time. It wasn't worth the trouble to return
0, buyer beware: I wanted the grinder as pictured. However
0, Product was manufactured poorly: The wooden handle was broke and the cookie attachment didn't fit with it because the notch in the grider did not line up with it. We returned the item.
1, This album is for Bone Players !: Ignore the previous reviewer. If you look at all that guy's reviews they are all one star and completely negative. At least he is consistant and I hope he cheers up soon.Here is a nice album recorded live at a session with Mingus bringing together 4 of the great modern trombonists. If ya don't like bebop don't buy it. Such a dichotomy of approaches to playing the instrument. A feast for jazz trombonists and a chance to hear these guys stretch out !
0, Not Recommended: I bought these on the hope that I'd find a relatively unknown but excellent canalphone. I was wrong. The sound is tinny and the build quality was sub-par. They broke within a month. Not Recommended!
0, Please go to the next one...: This was my first Linda Howard book and unfortunately
1, Fun and Easy read: I recommend this book to anybody who wants to read a little drama
1, Good book: I haven't read a whole lot of this author yet
1, Great Read!!!!!!!!: I laughed and grinned all the way through. These two will stay with me for a long while.
0, violence against dogs: I have a real problem with the suggestion to training dogs using threats
1, Great Book!: I bought this book to add to my collection of Ellen White's Writing. I love her writings which are very clear and to the point and is in line with the Word of God.
1," SCREAMING EAGLE SITS ALONE!!!: In college I had a buddy who was partial to ""our ladies of girth"". Now"
1, Moved: I first heard this album when I met this guy during spring break. When he first put it in I just liked a couple of songs but after playing it over and over again I grew to like the whole thing a whole lot. I was looking for the CD but I can't find it in any stores. I think this album puts a whole lot of emotion and feeling into it. After listening to this I now have a favorite group- THE OUTLAWZ and TUPAC!! I am going to be truthful with you
1, A great lesson for the creation and extension of jazz singin: What a pleasure to listen to this album. Five CD's take some time go through but it is worth every minute. The way this album is assembled is pure genuis by Prof. O'Meally. This album should be enjoyed by young adults as well and up to senior's. If one doesn't enjoy this album
0, Not worth the money: First of all it is a very short book about 40 pages
1, A Great Read: Population: 485 is a wonderful taste of rural firefighting and emergency response. The personalities are a microcosom of most country departments
1, The Pager!: The attention to the little details is what makes this book great for those of us in the business. Particularly anyone who has ever run volunteer fire
1, A thoughtful celebration of what ties us together: What a treat to find this great new book! This is a memoir by the most interesting character you could imagine. Michael Perry is a poet
0, DOESN'T WORK ON ORDINARY BOOTS: COULD BE THIS IS FOR COWBOY BOOTS ONLY WHICH I DON'T HAVE. WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT AS DOESN'T WORK ON BARBOUR RUBBER BOOTS ETC. WHAT DOES WORK IS OLD FASHIONED PLASTIC BAGGIES IN BOOTS!!! MAYBE RUN WITH THAT CONCEPT AND DESIGN LONG LASTING PLASTIC BAGGIE TYPE LINERS AND YOU'LL HAVE A WINNER. Meryl
0, Do not let others fool you!: I repeat - Do not let others fool you because this event was one of the worst WWF pay per views ever. Actually
1, Renewing The Faith and Recharging The Faithful: One of the rarest of things in popular music: A live performance that sounds great
0, If Jimi still lived he would punch the guy!: Hey
1, Outdated Postal Rates: The scale is every thing I wamted. The problem is it came with outdated postal rates. Exchanged twice and the same outdated postal rates. I have a third order on the way and hope it has today's postal rates.
0, I've Been A Round: This book is a compilation of short stories Tania wrote for a magazine. I did not find it as informative or interesting as her first book Maiden Voyage. Sadly
0, missing pages !!: I'm one starring(?) sheridan house not Tania
0, POS - into the garbage: This POS goes into the garbage.I just made up 11 bags. To seal a single end it took between 48 - 53 seconds of pressing downwards with 25- 30 pounds of pressure...only to seal one single end on one single bag. Yes
0," DON'T DO IT!: This film is a disaster. It is unfortunate that talented people (Mos Def) had to ""dumb down"" to share a screen with Beyonce' Knowles. Ms. Knowles needs to stick to shaking her behind because acting is not a talent she possesses. The music is a joke and the ""all-star cast"" needs to spend more time trying to salvage their music careers. Do not waste precious minutes of your life watching this train wreck. Watch Carmen Jones instead and see just how it's supposed to be done."
1, Entertaining.: This was a great way to teach history. Ha! There is a lot of action in this movie and it is actually quite entertaining. The music and singing is really good too.
1, Awesomely cool: An amazing movie with Josh Hutcherson. Two younger kids play a game that brings them into space and takes you too.Great to watch on movie nights
1, this is a neat kids movie: When you see the couch burning in outer space you know this movie isa kid's fantasy version of sci fi
0, Ruined by two foul words: I never write reviews
0, Not very good: I hate the characters in this. Everything is fake to them. They think they can pretend their way through life. Why would I emotionally invest in a play if none of the characters are worth my time? There are some deep
0, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!: Chances are none of these will work. Don't waste your money on memorex like I did! Try Verbatim instead
0, dual layer dvd disk for what?: I STILL AM NOT SURE WHY I PURCHASED THESE (6) DUAL LAYER DVD'S AFTER ONE YEAR ON MY SHELF
0, Fifty-dollar list price for a novel??? Gimme a break!: The first problem I have with this book is the absolutely laughable price tag. Even at Amazon's discount
1, My dog's absolute favorite: I've found all AKC dog toys to be of excellent quality. They are last quite a long time and are not easily torn up. My dog is particularly fond of the fox
0, Oh
1, My pup seems to like the shape and furry back of this hedgehog: I purchased a BUNCH of AKC dog toys for my beloved pup
0, AKC Classic Plush Mallard: This is another one of the AKC toys that I bought for my dog (does this stand for THE American Kennel Club and do they recommend these toys???)If they do
1, Dogs favorite: This is our third Squirrel plush toy in the last two years. The several daily thrashings it receives are a testament to its popularity and endurance. I does suffer an occasional loss of limb and stuffing but the excellent fabric holds a stitch well and and the dogs don't mind how it looks afterwards.I would give it five stars but the squeaker in the torso is sub par.
1, Squirrel Flyer: This toy is nice and sturdy because of the rope. I usually don't buy plush toys for my lab
1, Best book on raising emotionally healthy boys: I was nervous about having a boy
1, The naked truth about love
1, True Hyderabadi: An eye opener. Samina
1, The Heart Sutra: The Heart of Perfect Wisdom is actually the ancient Sanskrit Mantra from the Heart Sutra
1, Fun and feel-good movie: Queen Latifah and her team of less determined/confident beauty shop workers and supporters kept me laughing throughout their battle to create a successful beauty shop. Will they manage to survive the series of obstacles thrown at them by the well known and well-connected competition? (good vs evil) It is a very entertaining combination of drama and comedy. I've never seen a movie with Queen Latifah that I haven't loved
1, Works good
1, Slide Copier: Just as the film copying system previously rated
0, Tentative review: I don't know what to make of the Opteka Digital Duplicator. I am trying to use it on my Nikon D60 DSLR. I have a 55-200 mm zoom lens and an 18-55 mm. I have been trying to get a decently focused image
0, Terrible transfer!!! Do not buy this!: I have about 4000 DVDs and have seen bad transfers in my life. This DVD is one of the worst. The color is washed away
1, Review of A Deliverate Life: Good book overall.....I liked the references Pam makes to her Christian outlook. As a Christian
1, THIS BOOK IS HOT !! SIDESPLITTING !!: This tome was worth it !! A must read
1, SUPERB: I borrowed this book from a friend and I must say I was very pleased. I love books that make me feel the characters and this book does just that.I love your work Mr. Hardy. I can't wait for your new work of art.Keep up the good work!!!!
1, awesome: I plan on buying at least one more copy of this in case anything happens to the first one. This is a perfect album for meditation or just to soothe your stress. It truly reaches you at a soul level. Do not hesitate to buy this CD
0, at least it was better than the first!!!!!: not as good as i thought it would be.Not very good effects
0, Telling the ending first ruins the story: David Ellis attempts to use a different approach to the telling of this story. He begins at the end. But once the cat is out of the bag
0, Yoda a Book Writes: Ellis can usually be counted on to write a riveting thriller with plenty of unique twists. This is a thriller with one unique twist: the chapters are written backwards.It's possible that Ellis first completed this novel in regular format and then inverted the order of the chapters in order to give the book a gimmick. If so
0, No and No! Too Ridiculous!: As others before me
1, Russian: A Self-Teaching Guide: A valuable reference on Russian grammar
1, Dog Eye Wash: I have a dog with chronic eye problems and use a lot of eyewash. This is a big bottle and I got it when I needed another item for Super Saver Shipping. It works well. I just need to enlarge the dropper tip hole.
1, An excellent ending to an excellent series: I grew up reading the Samurai Cat series and cannot recommend the books eneough. I've read each book number of times
0, Keep your money in your pocket: This speaker is only slightly louder than the internal speakers in my IBM laptop.
0, Buyer Beware!!! Deceptive Advertising.: ***BUYER BEWARE*** The photographs associated with this item
0," Very Dissapointed!: When I received the ""30 Pegaditas de Oro"
1, EXCELLENT Text BOOK!: I really like the way that this book is written. The material is clearly written and easy to follow. Also
1, Best math book I've ever had: This book is a fabulous resource... explains things in as clear a way as Linear Algebra can be. If you want deeper understanding
1, This a very good family movie: I've seen this movie several times on cable and I highly recommend it to kids who are starting to play a musical instrument in their school band.
1, Great Danny Kaye Movie!: This isn't your standard Court Jester
0, Five Pennies Region 2: You should let people know that Region 2 is not able to be viewed in the United States. The movie is useless to me
1, The Five Pennies: A rather more different production to feature Danny Kaye but his talents are ably displayed as he portrays a musician and father. Be prepared for some sad parts but many aspects of the story ring true to life. Lots of great music and the scenes with Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong together are cinematic gold.
1, Tolkien liked it!: See the anecdote
1, Fine Sound Engineering: For those of you feeling their way into Super-Audio CD
1, Great Winter Boot: Ok
1, hot dog anyone?: John Kennedy Toole presents an eloquent
0, Not funny
0, Never purchase a Dove Audio product.: I have read this book no less than 7 times. I have seen the play and I anxiously await the making of the movie. I have been a big fan of books-on-tape for a long time. However
0, dont waste your time here: i read a confederacy of dunces at the beach over thanksgiving detirmined to finish it over a week. i figured it had to be considering it won the pulitzer prize award for fiction and will ferrell was considering starring in the still pending and possible (i hope not) movie version. i found all 416 pages of this book to be sheer pompousness and pointless. there was little plot..if any apart from the stripper darla's struggle. it was not worth the time to read. trust me. there are plenty of other good books out there.
1, masterful: A masterpiece! This is the best book I've ever read. The book for the bums of America! The best book about a slacker pushed into the work force ever. Filled with hilarious results.
1, Totally Crazy!!: This has to be one of the craziest books I've ever read. It is So Funny!!!The Catcher in the Rye and Running With Scissors are the only other books that are in a league with this one.Pure genius!!!!
0, Just a sad tale of an equally sad boob!: I had a hard time getting through this book
0, Totally unremarkable: The only interesting thing that kept me going through this book is the fact that so many people loved it. I am quite an omnivorous reader
0, A struggle: I finally had to put this away without finishing. I found it tedious and not even remotely funny. I got through about half of it and never found anything to hold my interest.
1, Why cant there be more!: I loved this book. The only thing I disliked is that there is no more to look forward to. Toole's understanding and usage of southern dialect is impeccable. If you love southern novels
0, Ah
0, Not amused: The first chapter of this novel bored me to tears. But
0, What a loathsome
1, wildly funny: This is one of the best books I have ever read (multiple times). Once you get the flavor of the New Orleans dialogue
0, Yuk
1, funniest book in the world: this has to be the most humorous book on the face of the earth. john kennedy toole was one of the greatest writers this
0, Agree to disagree: I struggled through this as it was recommended by a friend (and had won a major award). I didn't find it either hysterical or humorous - mostly inane. The only humor being the reality tv sort. If you enjoy watching (or reading about) train wrecks
1, Not as funny as people say
1, Funny!: What a character Ignatius Reilly is! This book lets the reader see both sides of the spectrum
1, depressing: Book was priced right and came in good reading shape. Hard to believe it was up for pulitzer. Sarcasm hard to take for extended periods. not my style. However good character developments and descriptions. Well written if you can see over the depressing characters and lives.
0," Terrible: This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Neither the ""wacky"" situations nor the ""quirky"" characters are funny / compelling. Ignatius's annoying outbursts of ""Oh my god!"" got repetitive after the first 50 times he utters it"
0, Large Print Dunced: I love this book and wanted to give my 93 yr young housemate the chance to read it.This large print WAS NOT large at all.I then had to buy her a magnifying glass.
0, Didn't Help: I was disappointed with this book. I wanted to give it a one
1," A ""must read"" for everyone.: An excellent resource for anyone who has ever been put down"
1, Children love all of these movies!: This whole set of movies are great. The grand kids love them
1, Anything for ISAIAH: I only have 1 grandchild and he loves THE LAND BEFORE TIME.We spend a lot of time together.I am getting so tired of watching the same few episodes over and over. I bought them as stocking stuffers
1," ?: I don't know a title for this review. The review will be ""short and sweet"" as well. I LOVED IT! I could just picture those kids ""doing their thing"" as I listened to the music. I'm so glad that this cd was produced."
1, Beautiful
0, who wrote piece-of-[stuff]?: This book is at the emotional level of a third grader. There is no concept of suspense
0, Worst helmet I ever bought. In 40 years.: I've been riding bicycles and motorcycles for the past 40 years
1," XL fit my huge head: I wear a 17 3/4"" hat and the XL fit my head perfectly. This helmet is strong and not bulky like some other helmets I have tried. I use it for bike riding and it keep my head relatively cool."
1, Just the Best!!!: These cds will take you back to when you were a kid sitting in front of the tv on Saturday morning watching the Little Rascals and eating your Pep or Cheerios. They are spot-on recreations of the music you listened to growing up and watching the Little Rascal shorts. If you are like me
1," The soundtrack to ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is excellent!: The soundtrack to ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is excellent! All of the tracks are excellent"
0, Disappointing soundtrack
0," False advertising: I picked this one up because it clearly stated on the outer packaging and on the inside slim case that the version of I Know What You Did Last Summer included was the exclusive 'Special Edition' with ""Director's short film 'Joyride' with optional commentary"
0, trite PC rambling: This author has discernible skill
0, Not Worth Your Time: Even though Melissa Gilbert is beautiful in this movie
1, A Holiday for Love: Our family collects Christmas movies
1, GOOD BUT NOT WORTH $31.00: I really like this movie. I've become a fan of Melissa Gilbert's movies as an adult and this one doesn't let me down. A nice holiday movie for anyone who still believes in the miracle of love. BUT..... it's not worth the outrageous $31.00 that sellers on Amazon are trying to sell it for. Shame on them for putting such a high price tag on this movie! I guess greed isn't reserved for executives in large corporations anymore.
0, Disappointed: While Road Fools 12 is an amazing video
1, A Yellow Raft in Blue Water: Long-held secrets and hidden truths are slowly revealed in this beautifully written book presented in three parts - each told through the eyes of a different generation of strong-willed Native-American women. As the plot of this intricate and emotional story unfolds
1, one heck of a rollercoaster ride: I had to read this book for College English and I couldn't put it down. Intertwining three strands
0, I think this book was overdramatized.: I had to read this book for my english class and i hated it. It was incredibly boring. It did not have any relavent content in the first 100 pages and everything else after that was just extremely unrealistic.
0, Immoral and inappropriate for minors: I am not reviewing the story. I am reviewing and warning parents about the content of this book. There are explicit sexual references
1, The Way It Happened: It is refreshing to see a western film done with such objectivity. The characters are real and are all that more interesting to watch because they are represented as family people who
1, wyatt earp: Back in college I made a book report on Wyatt Earp
1, best western ever: Kevin Costner doesn't get credit for being as good of an actor as he really is. It's nice to be able to see Warner Bros. release a film in the Western genre that
0, UNABLE TO WATCH: I BOUGHT IT FOR MY BLUE RAY UPDATED THE SOFTWARE AS THE INSERT SUGGESTED AND IT STILL IS NOT RECOGNIZING THE DISC...IT SUCKED...BECAUSE IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND...=0(
1, Great Movie on the Life of a Great Frontier Lawman: Though I am not a big Costner fan I must aknowledge when he does some superior acting
0," It's so real! (Yeah right): In the commercial Sammy claims that his game is ""...so real."" I beg the differ"
1, You'll be seven years old again...: if you grew up watching the Little Rascals
1, Great Beats: I really enjoy this album
1, Great Puppy Photos: What can one say...Some of the best photos of puppies I have seen. And
1, Freddie at his peak: The first album I ever purchased of Freddie Hubbard was Hubbard/ Turrentine live
0, Too dated and if you have a decent manual you don't need this book.: The first 8 chapters of this book are in your owners manual. Chapter 1 (what is a serger)
0, TOO. MIUCH.: I always knew Miley Cyrus was cold-hearted
0, I didn't like this movie at all.: I have read the book and watched the movie... I don't like it... yet I liked the notebook
0," worst movie ever: The Last Song is in a league of its own. It is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Miley Cirus is legitimately hard to look at with her veneers. Her face looks like she is smelling poop for the entire movie! I used to think she was a pretty good actress on ""Hannah Montana"" but now I literally dislike everything she has ever produced simply because of this movie. Please"
1," One of the Best: There are musicals and then there's ""On the Town."" The music"
1, on the town digital glory: excellent reproduction of the film
1, Cool-Can't wait for Version 2.0!: I loved how it went behind the scences of the music videos! I'm glad they showed clips of the b-side too
1, great book.: Great book for those wanting to learn Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). From a beginners point-of-view I've found it helpful in integrating regression with SEM models.
1, Insightful: Church Planting Movements is one of the most exciting books you could ever read. The insights gathered from movements around the world are great and highly useful. However
0, Disappointed - no captions: I bought this for Dead. Holstein to watch an it does not have closed captions so I am very disappointed. It was a waste of money!
0, Piece of junk.: The tip broke off this over priced piece of junk. I now avoid anything with the Rocketfish name printed on it.
1, A much better film than given credit for: Clint Eastwood still at his iconic best and some great talents involved front and behind camera. Much closer to the classic first film than the diminishing returns of the rest of the series when Harry disappointingly changed from almost super hero to just another cop. Other fans may not agree but for this reviewer the first two movies are the cream of the crop!!
1, Of Course Harry Comes Out Unscathed-: Nothing like going up against a bunch of motorcycle cops gone wild and crazy
0, Simply do not cancel sound at all.: I've owned various noise cancelling headphones
1, better than their new crap: I bought this album 5 years ago when it was first released. Until then
0," Gears strip on many systems: My unit didn't hold up well at all. Makes a horrible grinding sound. Did some checking and learned this is a ""very common problem with this model"" and it's an issue they don't suggest you self-repair. I read that as a design flaw. The main drive gear that powers the fuser strips out. Can't get to it easily. Nice features but the copier gave out quickly."
0, Incompatible with Windows Vista: I loved this printer
0, Wasting your time and money: Like wasting your time and money? Be sure to include this in your shopping list. It's a must have.
0, Buy Something Else: This is the second Sharp mutli-function unit I have had. They are junk! The USB 2.0 stopped working fairly soon. After about a year is started jamming all the time. Sharp support said it was beyond the warrenty and it was my tuff luck. I had simialr problems with my first Sharp machine
1," I Love Book of Love!: Book of Love is such a great band. An ex-boyfriend introduced me to them back in the early 90's. ""I Touch Roses"" still holds dear to my heart after all these years. I was happy to hear ""Boy"" in a Queer As Folk episode. It's too bad they didn't get the recognition they deserved. I don't care though I love them. I'll always support their music.~"
1," No ""Three Kings?"": Very disappointed they left off the near-impossible-to-find ""Three Kings"" Christmas song they did way back. Also"
1, Book of Love for sale: After a eight year hiatus
1," Great film: While still an ""early Bergman"
1, Too Few Harold Lloyd films!!!!!!: Nobody should deny us the privilage of these classic Harold Lloyd Comedies:-Safety Last -The Freshman -The Kid Brother -SpeedyAnd much more
1," The Little Engline that Could--Original edition--hardcover: After reading the ""original"" ""retold by Watty Piper"" edition"
0, Misleading! Buy Season One instead!: I bought this because I thought it was separate from Season One
1, The spark of idependence: Filled with the independent spark that made us all love life at one point or another. A fun
1," The perfect diaper bag: This bag is perfect. It is organized intelligently-lots of pockets and room inside. The changing pad has a pocket on the back that it slides down into so it doesn't take up room in the bag. The stroller clips are awesome--it works on my Quattro and my P3. The mommy pocket with key chain clip is nice to keep your wallet and other ""mommy"" items"
0, Ugly Colors!!: This bag is a very gross color of brown. The pink and the brown do not even go with each other. The bag also has a black strap making this a very un-coordinated product. Returned it for something else.
1, GMWA: This CD is nothing short of a blessing. The choir is annointed
0, Terrible: I agree with the previous review. This is the most terrible movie I believe I have ever watched. The acting was horrible
1, Works perfectly: I compared the customer reviews of this item and items that looked the same
1, very happy: I'm really happy with this shoe rack. I'd like it to be a little bit taller
0, Rusty platform: This product is versatile and what I expected- However it did arrive from the vendor with a rusted out base. Rather than hassle with the vendor and pay to ship it back for an exchange...we spray painted it to cover the rust. I figured it would be hiding in the closet and didn't need to look pretty- only not seep rust onto the carpet.
0, Don't bother with this product: This shoe rack has good intentions
0, battery killer
0, DO NOT BUY!!!!: Had this camera for just under a year
0, Gel Pens: The idea is great for these having the variety of colors
1, Oroville Ca Images of America: The Images of America Oroville
0, unhhhhhh: Half baked
0, Her thinnest veil yet.: Listeng to this album

0, what is it with this singer?: she has such a credible rep
0, No No No 
0, Boo!!!: The reason I rate this book so low is because it started off okay
0," ""support for S & M/torture--Bush would love it"": I like mysteries"
1, Outstanding and informative for even a beginning horseperson: Like most of the other books published by the United States Pony Club
0, Cyberspace and the Media: Another interesting view on cyberspace
0, Did Not Work on Shower Door: The Brushtech Sliding Window & Shower Door Track Cleanerdid not work on my shower doors. I really needed toclean the area and was hoping the brush would help inthe hard to clean areas on the door track. Maybe itworks on sliding windows??
0, bubbles: I have purchased bubbles like this in the past and they were wonderful. I recommend purchasing them from the store if you can find them. I think these had been sitting around too long and they didn't work. They were a sticky mess and not one bubble was catchable. I spent a lot of money on one tube because I couldn't find them in the store and I ended up throwing it away. I would not recommend.
0, Get a proofreader
0, This CD is pure fluff: Aside from the Raekwon
0, DJ CLUE (BOO): DJ.CLUE has no clue of what is is doing. First off he is wack
1, In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see...: ...so begins beat poetry's most enduring classic (37 printings and counting!)
0, Worst Book Ever: This is a review of the paperback version.The book presented in the LOOK INSIDE! preview of the book
0, A difficult read.: While the premise of the book is true
0, P.T. Barnum was right...: In this tome
0," Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises: Garner's book helps to answer the many lawyer questions you get asked when trying to write legal documents or multiple-user documents in Plain Talk. Garner's approach reinforces Plain Talk and shows ways around the mountains of ""What if?"" and ""How can we say it without risk?"" issues. Because of its publication date"
0, STOP RIGHT HERE!: Take it from me (the Praga encyclopedia)
1, Clutch: So I finally bought this cd
1, The Importance of Being Earnest: This is an incredibly amusing story of Wilde's
1, Enjoyed this: Funny
0, contains too much hype!: contained too many unrealistic income expectations for person to attain. Also
1, By far the very best!: This thesaurus clearly outstanding...um...exceptional..striking..impressive...remarkable.... compared to any other I have used. My writing would be so dull...er...dry
0, Poor Binding: I was unaware of how poor the binding is until it was delivered.Regardless of how careful one is in handling
1, Writing reference: The Synonym Finder is an excellent resource and should be on every writer's desk. This book was recommended to me and I am so pleased!
1, THE BEST
1, University Hospital: These books are awesome. Just make sure you start with the first book and read them in line. It would be best is you ordered all three at one time so as soon as you finish one
0, Too general: Some helpful basic information
0," ""NOT VERY INFORMATIVE "": THIS BOOK DOES NOT EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ABOUT THE BALL PYTHON"
0, Starrett 734: It would be nice if I would have actually received a Starrett 734 mic as the description states. Instead I received a Starrett 3734 which is a cheaper copy of what I was supposed to get. I am very unhappy with the product I received.
1, Great!: I ordered from books-go-round and it was delivered within the week that I ordered it! It is also in GREAT condition
1, Good Service!!!: Received it pretty quick
1, Great for minimizing wrinkles: I started using this product about 3 years ago
1, NOT for metalheads: Not necessarily a review
0, Never got it: Bad service
0, Don't waste your time with this one: While the subject matter is highly interesting
0, Better atlases are available: Something of an outdated dinosaur. Pictures are consistently less clear than Netter's anatomy atlas. Look at it before you buy to make sure you find the pictures acceptable.
1, Freedom Rings True: I must say
1, Wonderful listening: I absolutely love this cd
1, Excellent Sequel to MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN: ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN is the sequel to the Newbery Honor Book
1, Find out what happens...: On The Far Side of The Mountain is a great book. The author is Jean Graighead George. My favorite character is Sam Gribly. One day his bird Frightful got taken away by a concentration officer. Sam was accused of harming an endangered species. Sam went to Delhi because he wanted to see if the guy who came was a real officer and he was. When he got back
1, Unique Christmas music: My son-in-law is a not a big fan of Christmas music
0, Seemed Anti-Christmas to me - more of winter solstice album: After listening to this it just didn't feel right - it was not a celebration of Christmas and all that this holiday represents from either the secular or religious aspects
1, Wonderful story for Seth: Nora has given Seth a great story and it was nice to see how he had grown up and what he had made of himself from his tough start in the first three books. It was wonderful to revisit Cam
1, It Was A Good Story: I have read several of Nora Roberts' books and enjoyed most of them. This one was good
1, Favorites revisited: It was great to return to the great characters in this family that Nora Roberts has created. To see what time has visited them with
1, John Gray is brilliant once again!!!: Dr. Gray offers guidelines and advice that makes sense. The information is helpful and seems to validate my gut feeling on most of his suggestions.Just as with the Mars Venus advice for adults in relationships
0, boring boring boring: I started to read this book and it lost my interest quick! I read the first 38 pages and never picked it up again. My friends agreed that its very repetitive & boring.There is many excellent parenting books out there
0, Best Concept since the Thousand Year Reich: Manifestos of cultural superiority
1, Sabrent USB-DSC5 SATA Adapter: Who ever thought this kit up deserves a reward. It was very easy to hook up once I figured it out
1, I had better when i worked in IT: This isn't the best one I've owned but it's simple and it did the job. It ran an old 4700 RPM ATA laptop hard drive straight from USB.The first time I plugged in the USB then plugged in the HD... that was bad. Don't do that.1. Plug in the drive to the converter
1, It worked!: Super great. Our Windows OS crashed and was completely un-bootable. Using this cable and power adapter I was able to plug in the hard drive externally to my Mac through the USB port and get all of our photos and files! Worked very well.
1, Easy to use and works: Hello
0, Be careful using it !: Purchased this adapter so I could load information on a new SATA drive before installing in the laptop.NO instructions come with the adapter
1, Very Usefull: Great tool for accessing bare drives from any computer with a USB connection. I have tested this unit on IDE drives
0, Truly awful product.: I got 2-3 uses out of it. Intention when I bought this was simply to use for wiping drives. It worked fine on the first couple of drives (SATA). Now when I plug the USB cable in only the blue light appears. Depending on if I have an IDE or SATA drive attached
0, very disappointed: Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5-/3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power Supply it didn't work
1, Great value
0, Very Dangerous Device: I bought this 3 in 1 cable yesterday and hooked it up to a SATA drive I was trying to remove data from and the adapter fried my drive instantly. This is a very dangerous product and i don't recommend it to anyone.
0, Worked for two days: I use one of these at work
0, Confusing story
0, Old Man: This book was written for an older version of SolidWorks than the one I have. It was not much help to me.
1, Great performances
0," DISAPPOINTING DVD: MGM Vintageclassic - NOT. Color is flat and detail is soft. Why would MGM even consider releasing such a ""Classic"" film in other than the widescreen format. The film"
1, An all time fav: So glad I could get this original classic with Gregory Peck. And the price was great. It arrived on time too.
1, Excellent Film Adaptation Of A Complex Story: I think this film version of Herman Melville's classic novel was a remarkable achievement for all involved. The novel Moby Dick is incredibly complex and textured but somehow director John Huston captured the essence of the tale. There seems to be a lack of consensus among critics regarding Gregory Peck's performance. For me Peck has become the embodiment of Captain Ahab after watching this numerous times over the years.Orson Wells is in one scene but he is fabulous as Father Mapple delivering a sermon that is one of the great moments in movie history.The cinematography 
0," Office 2007 - big mistake: I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine; the highly touted ""Ribbon"" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET"
1, Quite Good: I didn't think I'd like this album as much as I did when I bought it
1, Buy this one!: This is a great collection of fresh new songs - definitely worth purchasing! The instrumentals are innovative
1, Wife loves it!: Made a great Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it almost as much as the matching Charles Dickens book.
1, Pretty amazing stuff-circa 1970 as well (!): The title is misleading: this is actually a complete Boogaloo Joe Jones Album.Imagine you're standing at a party of the hippest musicians. Everyone is feeling great and the music ends. With everyone watching
1, A lot of information on St. Peter: I enjoyed this book. Most writers about St. Peter beat around the bush and do not talk about Peter the man. This book does. The language can slow your reading pace a bit
1, review: I was sent a paperback instead of the hardcover version I ordered. However
1, New Nate Dog Fan: With a very limited exposure to Hip Hop/Rap
1, Loved it but...: I bought this book while away on vacation knowing nothing of this author. I loved the book but was disappointed that the ending was so abrupt. An epilogue would have been appropriate. This will not keep me from reading Ms. Forster's other however.
1, Solid: Have only had for several weeks but it's working great. Holds up well. Good quality. Easy to follow instructions when assembling this product!
0, Spotty at best: I own this system and have owned VTECH phones in the past - this will be my last. Sometimes the phones connect; sometimes they don't - seems to be their choice. I also have an (older) Panasonic system in the house which works great all the time. CAVEAT EMPTOR - you get what you pay for here - poor quality and spotty connections. On the plus side: when they do connect
0, No one is nice no one is truthful: I so disliked this book that I did not want to finish it.A marriage of convenience. She gets in the family way has a miscarrage and he sends her away. Enter evil P.A. who tell all sorts of lies to wife while trying to get in the husbands pants
0, Shot Pot: Purchased this for very long road trip.First time used
0, Don't accidentally leave it on with no liquid!!!!: I accidentally left the mug plugged in less than a minute after pouring out the water and smelt burning and then unplugged it immediately. The next time I tried to use it
1, A wonderful book: This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever seen. It is full of large colour plates of exceptional quality
1," B/W and color episodes: Of the 104 total episodes in ""The Adventures of Superman"
1, Superman Season 1: This was the first time I was able to see episode 1 in its entirety. The initial opening of the show was a little confusing
0, GARBAGE!!!: This is the album that started the demise of this once great band. Dork and Fly in the Ointment were the best these guys came out with. I've seen them too many times to count but after they toured for this release
0, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM: I am a huge Wu fan and always will be
0, Not what I was expecting: After seeing the video with Busta
0, what the?: this album is nominated by me for the worst thing that ever happened this year for music. The lyrics seemed to be written by a four year old who is retarded. I've lost faith in Method man after this album
0, None: None the palace of pleasure volume l is not worth the time it takes to download it and then delete it.
1, Supergroup Jing Chi's '3D' is another triumph: The third release of the blues/jazz/fusion supergroup Jing Chi is an amazing mixture of the afore mentioned music.'3D' brings together again blues guitarist Robben Ford
1, Best Ballad Singer of his times next to Tim Buckley and Tim Hardins: Bob Dylan: Eric Andersen is one of the best ballad singers I have listenedto. Now that is the truth and a true compliment. If you enjoy Dylan
0, Couldn't get it to work: I have a Linksys wireless 4-port cable/DSL router which works well with a Cisco Aironet PC card. Unfortunately
0," Must be two books with the same title: The Amazon reviews for a book titled ""Up Jumped the Devil"" must surely be referring to another book with the same title. The one I read was a very weak effort by an author seeming to act out his own fantasies about life as a crime reporter. I only hope the author's career as a reporter produced more clear writing than he was able to produce in this uninteresting"
0, Up Jumped The Devil: This wasn't something I would enjoy
0, not a good brush for feet: I was looking for a brush that I could use to clean my feet. I remember when I was young
1, one of the greatest albums I own: if you like Rudimentary or Crass
1, Definitely cool: Death Church is a great album
0, Long and awful...: I agree with other reviewers. Neither of the two main characters was likeable at all. They spent the whole book arguing posintlessly about leaving each other. The book could have ended 200 pages sooner and it would have been alright with me. Terrible.
0, This one is not worth reading.: I bought this book second-hand
1, A magic book made me feel like microwave do: I got this biik from my teacher in ISU and have kept it dusted for nearly 2 years. One day when I found it by chance I was so surprising that many good words inside and secure my confusions.It's not only a book

1, a lot of bang for your buck: It's a great show and a long episode list.lots of entertainment value for a low price.it's been repackaged to be cheaper but also more inconvenient.in my opinion
1," Warning ...A bit different then expected...: Everything is as described by the previous review. All the seasons are on two giant spindles protected by a cardboard on top of each spindle. Thought there would be a ""better"" version of episode list but there isn't. It is just a piece of paper glued on the box that you will have to peel off to actually see the list.Overall not bad for $40 bucks"
0, review is for packaging only!!!!!!!!: no list of episodes and discs are stacked on top of each other
0, Just a collection of previous releases: While a complete series collection is always a good thing
1," Superb soul of the highest order: This is a truly fantastic soul album that is easily enjoyable by all and is a requirement for any eclectic music lover.The only minor gripes I have with this album that prevent me from giving it five stars are: the last song ""By the Time I Get To Phoenix"""
0, Not as expected. Poor quality recording: The music was uneven and the volumn was going in and out as I listened to it. Really disappointing. Poor quality recording.
0, False claims: I purchased a cd from this seller that was advertised as new. However the cd came in an unsealed cd case and was obviously used. The insert was old and had stains on it and was slightly ripped. When I contacted the seller she denied that the cd was used. The only reason I kept it was because the cd was in good condition and I didn't want to go through the trouble of shipping it back. I won't order from this seller again.
0, it's never s easy as you think: I purcashed the new NIS 2005 to replace my older copies of sameit won't un-install what it needs to by itself
1, Polyphonic Chanting At Its Best: If you enjoy Tibetan monk chanting
0, I could do without the throat clearing.: This would have been great except I kept hearing someone in the foreground clearing their throat. Not the really bad phlegm sound but still it bugged me. Perhaps this explains the price
1, the last of the mohicans: it is a very good book but the english that it is written in is different from the way we speak today. I enjoy the book and will recommend it to everyone looking for something that is good to read and to all children for their classes that require reading books.
0, NO
0, Interesting plot
0, wow: I read this book and im 13 and i don't think i should have read beacuse the book was very graphic about killing ect. i would not recommend this book to anyone under 13. besides that the storyline was ok. I would only read this book on a rainy day.~*~shelby~*
1, Very Helpful: This book is well-written and has concise
0, Not exactly a page-turner: I got this one for Christmas and read it on the plane ride home because it was only slightly more entertaining than the inflight magazine or the guy sitting next to me. Where to start? Two-dimensional characters
0, Run
1," A Joyous Christmas Album!: This is one of the best gospel Christmas albums of all time. It is on my ""must play"" list for the holiday season.As mentioned in other reviews"
1, Magnificent stories
1, Good Product: I am a therapist at a nursing home and bought this product so my residents can hear the timer go off and read the display. The timer is wonderful and is loud enough for the hard of hearing to hear. The display is also large enough so they can see it. We havent had a problem with them not working at all. It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.
1, Small Digital Timer: Simple operation
0, Way too quiet: I had bought an identical timer from Amazon a couple of years ago
0, Timer resets itself when I don't want it to!: There is no way to turn it off so in order to save the battery you will need to take it out after each usage and my timer keeps resetting back to 00:00
0, Could not get the timer to work: The timer kept going up and down with both set of the numbers superimposed over each other
1, Works well enough: I was used tomy old one but am getting used to this one now. It does the job and is easy to use
0, junk: loved it right out of the box
1, Works as advertised: This timer is easy to read and easy to hear. In a room of about 30 people
1, Kitchen Timer: Handy and easy to operate. Big readout so it can be read across the room. Magnetic back allows it to be placed on the refer door.Buy two or three of these
1, Perfection -- what more can you ask for?: Ah
0, Rather worse than it should be...: The Doctor has had it with Peri - her truculence and unwillingness to join in his unfocussed joi de vivre means that he decides to drop her off back on Earth. But on the way they run into a Kontron Tunnel
1, nice magazine: This magazine has great pictures really makes you want to go to the places. They review all price range places to travel and places you may have never thought of. Am happy with the magazine
0, absent: I have not yet received any!please advise as to when it mayarrive
1, I am ready to pack: I can't wait for travel magazines to come in the mail and I am really inspired by this magazine. It provides cultural awareness while sitting in my living room. I definitely want to visit places I read about. I can't wait until the next issue already.
0, The villains seemed way too nice.: Relatively well written book
0, fishy parts: Ball joint arrived with missing cap for grease fitting
0, Lowlifes on the low key: Plusses: interesting faces; quiet
1, Not my favorite
1, British bands are better: Lead singer Danny McNamara has a voice that connects with a yearning place in your heart. Full of soaring
0, If your EARS could get AIDS..: Then this would be that one time you wish you'd used a condom.For all those Oakie fans who own or have listened to albums like Tranceport
0, SuperOakie on Kryptonite?: Someone has taken over the controls of Oakenfold Central
0, Not the Oakenfold we knew and loved!: Very disappointing collection of downtempo
0, Clever premise
1, Cold Chills: I played this game when I had the nintendo 64
1, A superb sequel
1, Carolina Moon: What a great read..N>R has really done it this time. I could not put it down and hated when it ended. Growing up in many of the same places that the book was set in
1," One of my Favorite Books by Nora Roberts: This is my second favorite book by Nora Roberts. I love the suspense in this book. I couldn't put ""Carolina Moon"" down."
1," Carolina Moon: I found this story to be a good read well up to Nora Robert's usual standards. Tory Bodeen grew up in an abusive home with a father who tried to beat her strange ""feelings"" out of her. She has psychic/empathic feelings and felt her best friend"
0, Yuk.....: This book is the first I have ever not been able to finish. I think Nora Roberts is a poor author. I don't know if it is because she used too many adjectives or because she jumps around in time too much
0, SKIP THIS ONE: Hey you Roberts' fans
1, All in one
0, Don't listen to the audio version!!: I'm writing this review for anyone who might be thinking about listening to the audio version. It is the worst audiobook to which I've listened! The reader poorly conveyed emotion of the characters in conversation
0, GREAT CLIPPERS! TERRIBLE BATTERIES!: Disappointed for the money :( I will probably never buy cordless again! Horses get too impatient!
0," Average performances - terrible sound quality: I needed a recording of the ""Alle Rustica"" RV 151 in a hurry. Too bad for me. The sound is dark and very muddy as if it was recorded in the bottom of a well. Not recommended."
1, A great investment!: This well-written book has been immensely helpful in bringing me up to speed on R/3 change management practices. It certainly goes far beyond R/3 on-line help. It is both well-organized and of great depth and breadth. The glossary alone was worth the purchase price.
0," here's a fun quote: ""Nevertheless"
0, Wordy Waffle - not a shred of value in it!: There are plenty of books this bad
0, Pain!: This book is really really horrible. It took me a while but I finally finished it hoping it would get better.....it didn't. I was disappointed in the book after having read and enjoyed the 'ware series and Hacker and the Ants. My advice is don't bother.
1, love ungaro iii: i used this perfume about 10 years ago and looked for till i saw it at amazon. i really love this product and what i got was exactly what i saw and expected. it is highly recommended for those who are connossieurs of perfumes.
1, cd-kse: Well
0, lost something along the way: Im sorry if this pisses off rabid KsE fans but these guys just lost it after they lost Jesse Leach. In many ways this sounds exactly the same as the previous disc. I think they reached a pinnacle with Alive or Just Breathing and have not surpassed it since. Although there are some hints of progression and maturity I must say overall the disc fails to hold my interest
1, really good album: I was actually really surprised how good this record is. I had kind of mixed feelings going in based on what I've read from theses reviews and I tunes but this record feels really strong to me. don't get me wrong they're are a few songs that pull it down a little but it's not enough to allow a star drop from me. I can't wait for the new one to come out sometime this year.
0, This album is not for real KSE fans.: I was looking forward to hearing this album but it sounds as if KSE has went emo on us. The excellent guitar is barely noticable
1, Almost As Good As The End of Heartache: Killswitch continues on their swath of melodic metalcore destruction with As Daylight Dies
1, A wonderful book
1, Pioneer life in Florida centered around killing the wildlife: I was quite surprised that this book really isn't written for children. It is an adult book. I found it interesting
0, THE YEARLING: The Yearling is an awful book!!!!!!!!!! Don't ever read it!!!!!! If you read the yearling you will puke because it is just that awful!
1, Delicious and they smell a lot better than most: I purchased the Vigo Sardines in oil with lemon based on the reviews in Amazon. They are quite good. The Sardines are tender and there is a bit of actual lemon in the can. I love the fact that they smell a lot better than sardines I am used too. From what I have read the difference is that these fish are canned soon after they are caught. I usually have them for lunch at work and my office does not begin to smell like a fish market. The fish have an almost salmon like color on the inside which is visually appealing. I have already purchased 20 more tins! And the price is right.
1," Hijacked by cingular: This is an amazing piece of equipment. I have used the RAZR V3 for 2 years. This is only that much better. Bright screen. Brillient Graphics. Fast operating system. Huge memory. Decent camera. Quantum improvement over the original RAZR v3The downside: Cingular has replaced the functional ""Mail"" button with their ""Video"" button. I own a phone to talk and text. Cingular wants you to watch ""Video"" ($10.00/minute without plan). Push that button by mistake and it will be a very expensive day.A fantastic phone by Motorola undone by Cingular's ""Marketing"" department.Can't wait to purchase an unlocked"
1, Gives great ideas for how to keep a class efficient: This book is one of the most informative books that I have read addressing how to keep a class on track. It gives ideas for class interaction
1, Info packed!: Although a few years old now this book is full of great information. I borrowed one from a friend and loved it so much I ordered my own. Highly recommended for detailed information on bird habitat and behavior.
0, Bait and Switch Software Purchase: TO; Amazonseller15@yahoo.comI emailed you last night concerning my purchase. On closer examination after checking my Amazon purchase recent I noticed that the software you sent was not what I ordered. My order was for the Small Business Full Version 2007 whereas the one you sent was a scaled down version Office Professional. I feel like I'm being scammed here. I expect you to rectify this. I did open the software and install it thinking it be the one I ordered. In spite of this due to the wrong being shipped I expect a full refund or the correct software mailed to me. MR .Monkiewicz
0, Not great value but Word and Excel are great programs: What can anybody say about software for which there is no choice but to buy? Can't do without it - had to buy it. Therefore I think the deal could be better.
1, Bearded Dragon: Facts & Advice on Care and Breeding: This is a wonderful book for anyone who has recently acquired or are thinking of acquiring a bearded dragon. Whatever your questions are...this book has the answers. I recommend that this be the first book you purchase.
0, Waste of Money: It does not work
0, Only has two blades: I don't recommend this model. It only has two blades
1, choppin': 4th one over the years
0, Do yourself a favor-- don't buy this!: I bought this reader a few weeks ago at Fry's for $14.99. My boyfriend and I were taking a two-week trip and wanted to be able to periodically download photos from our cameras and burn them to discs.Easy enough
1, The best game you've never played...: Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Seriously. This game has everything I've looked for in a game and kept me plastered to the screen for hours until I beat it. The art of game making has long been lost
0, Waste of money: Poor instructions
0, you send me the wrong one: I ask for memory for 
1, Composition and Technique Equal Lyrical Masterpiece: Pat Martino's unbelievably beautiful album
1, Must have!: I was given one of these hand print towers for my first born. When my second came along
0, Problematic: It's easy to mix the plaster
1, It Works!: Hey
0, Waldo in same location every page: I love Waldo and all but in this book he is located in the same position on almost every page. There are so many wonderful spots they could hide him but they end up putting him in either the bottom left or right side of the page almost every time. The kids got thru the book very fast and they were disappointed with him being in the same place all the time. There are definitely not enough pages either.
1, Great fun for all.: I purchased this for my five year old for Christmas. Before I could get it wrapped I was looking for Waldo! This is a great family book and really generates a lot of excitement for any age.
0, Out-of-box experience is thumbs down: Installed OK on XP/Home and have tried every conceivable way to simply open a JPG file on a LAN based server. Twenty minutes later
0, Crashes Too Often: Although this package comes with several disks of print templates and a large
0, pretentious and pompous: Maybe I am just getting tired of Argento' work but every other his movie I watch seems worse and worse. Yes
1, 100 Amazing Facts About the Negro With Complete Proof: This is excellent book with the proof you can research yourself. I always are enlightened by J.A. Rogers books they will help you understand alot about racial relations even for today.

1, Handy for all headphones: These are handy for all sorts of headphones
0, if I had friends like these I'd hide it
0, disappointing . . .: i'm a big fan of cornwell's
1, Best Cornwell in Quite Some Time: After being somewhat disappointed by recent Cornwell efforts
1, The Real Cornwell is back!: Point of Origin is in keeping with the Cornwell we have come to know and love. Her best book still remains Post Mortem. This book rates a very close second. I found the ending to be alittle weak and lacking in satisfaction; anti-climatic. There were also changes in the characters that went without explanation
0, Disappointing: I am a dedicated P. Cornwell fan
0, A once-fine series descends to hackwork.: The early Kay Scarpetta novels are quite good
0, A vast disappointment from Cornwell: Patricia Cornwell's books have been falling off in quality over time
1, Great comeback!!!: I have been a KS fan since the beginning. Your latest book was great. Just do me a favor???? Next time you want to go on a tangent
1, One of Cornwell's best: This book reminded me why I used to love to read for fun. I couldn't put it down and found myself waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out the plot.
1, Had a few reservations
0," Point Of Origin: I have read and enjoyed a few Patricia Cornwell novels.Point Of Origin seemed rather flat in comparison. I never really got pulled into this story and the ending fizzled. The reason I jumped onto Amazon today was to look up her earlier works I may have missed. I wanted to get back to the ""good stuff""."
0, This was Cornwell's worst book.: Ok
0, POO.....correct term for title and what I thought of it.: This has to be one of the worst PC books I've read. The characters have become shallow and caught up in personal problems that weigh down the book. I am most disappointed in the way PC handled the whole plot of Wesley Benton. KS had lost her touch in this book....why so concerned with Lucy...why the lack of concern and care for Benton???? Please
0, A potboiler of no distinction: This was my first Scarpetta novel; it will be my last. A flimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said
0, I've moved onto other authors now: I have read all of PC's books in the last couple of months. I really loved them until this last book. I have gotten tired of Lucy
1, I wanted to read slowly hoping the book wouldn't end.: The minute a Kay Scarpeta book hits the book stores I'm there! Cornwell is outstanding! Each one is better than the last
0, Disappointing: After having read all of Cornwells books except the biography of Ruth Graham I found this one puzzeling. As I read it I repeatedly asked myself if it was written by Cornwell or someone else. It simply doesn't have the level of sophistication in the writing
1, Never Ceases To Amaze Me: It Never Ceases To Amaze Me that every time someone comes up with a great new product some upper management idiot comes along and takes it off the market. Prior to the availability of Banana Boat Suntanicals
0," The Rubbermaid 1181 is a discontinued product: The Rubbermaid 1181 is a discontinued product and at least Uncle Joe's admits that's not what they are offering (see their comments under ""Featured Merchants""). Presents for you makes no disclaimer but shipped a 1182 which has the drain on the opposite side and as the previous reviewer noted is not a suitable substitution. In either case"
1, Pleasant Surprise: I've never played the TS series before
1, swim video: This video is great for parents to learn some great holds
0," obviously missed 30 seconds over tokyo: Would have been a good book if author had merely seen one of my favorite movies ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo""."
0, Behold the Many: If you were thinking about killing yourself before reading this book....DON'Tvery depressing.I kept waiting for something good to happen...nope...nada....never...not even once
0," Don't waste your time or money: This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" gay movie.. its a glimpse of a sick and twisted person exploiting a drug addict for his pleasure. Not a movie you walk away from feeling good about seeing it."
1, A nice easy read containing practical tips to boost your career: A good book with some very practical advise on how to succeed as a manager
1, Outstanding music
0, No it isn't: Here it is
0, uh........: well
1, Breath of fresh air: With so many bands coming out these days with similar styles
1, Cool Album (tom is cool but brings out the other side of him): It's wickid but tom i thinkj was better in blink but he's doing pretty good with ava. SO GOOD LUCK TO YA TOM!!! (by the way buy the cd)
0, Caused system freezes within 3 minutes: This card did not work at all on a dual 800 G4(not MDD) running 10.4.4. Within 3 minutes of booting the system it would freeze and require a restart. I had to return the card and continue using a smaller system disk attached to the slow ATA66 bus that comes in the machine. I've decided to use a firewire drive to house the large data volume that I need.
0," Really Disappointing!: This film is a complete departure from the 1st two ""Return""movies. Whereas the first two movies in the series are funspoofs of the genre"
0, Major Disappointment. Why? No B-Sides.: This elaborate
0, Should have been done better: Although it's cheap
1, Sneakers: Love this movie. Very clever story and some fine acting by Redford and Aykroyd. Actually everybody in this movie has a great part. Very fun movie
1, Very enjoyable
1, A Classic Waiting To Happen: Ever thought the Government know our every move?SNEAKERS won't try to change your mind. This is a fantastic cast (Redford
0," How Richard Ben Cramer Lost: A very narrow minded and disappointing discussion. I wonder if a better title for this book is ""How Richard Ben Cramer Lost"" Israel as a reporter and author."
0, dishonest and disgraceful: Cramer is intellectually and factually dishonest in his portrayal of the situation. He presents a particular view that sees only from that one
1, Rich and insightful: What a thought-provoking
0, What a let down: I really loved this series
0, Amongst Friends: Unfortunately
1, Episode 11? Does anyone know who took it?: My husband and I just happened upon this program and loved it after the first episode. Only we came to Season three and find that episode eleven is not episode eleven
1, A Good Man in a Commercial World: This is an excellent novel. It tells the story of a brilliant man who
0, Obviously
1, Really Nice Poster: This poster is really great
1, maximally soothing: My acupuncturist put in this CD for me to listen to while I was 'under the needle' and it was so soothing I just had to buy it. I remember the night breeze stirring the curtains in the window of my childhood bedroom and hearing these guys croaking down by the creek at the foot of the hill. If you have similar memories
0, Re-Volt: It's ok for a few hours
1, Want photographs that really capture your family and vacations? Get this book.: Wow. I have bought a lot of photography books in an effort to improve my pictures - composition
0, The Fighting Agents - W.E.B.Griffin - UNABRIDGED AUDIO: Something is WRONG with this listing!! An Unabridged Griffin audio is NOT 4 cassettes long. So that leaves us with an ABRIDGED audio.Also
0," no support & does not work well with win7 or Vista: Simple Tech (Hitachi) no longer provides support for any of the SimpleShare Office servers. The servers ""do not work well with Vista or Win7"" as per an email I received from Simple Tech."
1, Tasty funkatronic treat: I was driving through Philly on a friday afternoon in August
1, Very scenic and relaxing movie: The movie has beautiful photography of tropical landscapes
0," Not exactly what I expected ...: This bit is fairly well made and reasonably finished for an inexpensive item. I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars as a good combination of low cost and reasonably quality except that it arrived marked ""Made in China."" Nobody who cares for animals needs to be reminded that ""made in China"" means disaster-in-the-making. No agency checks or regulates the advertised metal content of horse bits. The Chinese record of substituting adulterated materials is too egregious to be overlooked. I bought 3 of these for clients who will have to wait a little longer for bits made in the UK"
1, Gleek w/Ricky Martin: Love Glee and I had missed this episode with Ricky Martin. It was fantastic. Thanks for making TV shows available on Kindle Fire.
1, Great show!: It was so nice to take time out from a busy schedule and relax with an episode of Glee without commercial interuption.
1, Fun: I never thought that I would like Glee so much. But the actors are so talented and there is a lot of musical variety. I am looking forward to the next season but am at a loss as to how they can continue after all the graduations. Great fun...
0, Glee season 3 is the worst: Glee season 3 is awful. The actors are fake
1, Awesome and tear jerking episode: This episode of glee was tearful. The ending wasnt what I expected at all.. It makes me wonder what's going to happen to Finnechel after their breakup... and Kurt? what is he going to do??
0, The epitome of junk science: This book started the leftist
0, people dead from malaria: People have died from malaria because of this book. DDT could've helped those in dire need.
1," DDT case study a ""fraud"": It's been several years since I've read ""Silent Spring"
1, Good for working in hot
0, impossible to program: This watch proved to be impossible to program the basics of date and time into ... I finally had to buy another 'analog' watch.
1, Practical
0, Homophobia at its most virulent: If the Christian Right wanted to make a hateful
1," Superlative ambient compilation: This compilation of the more sedate and ambient works from some of the artists on the Spotted Peccary label is a great collection and serves as a fine introduction to the ""new"" direction in which the label is headed. Many of the cuts are halfway between drifting serene ""warm"" ambient and darker soundscapes. But nothing here is the least bit disturbing or disonnant. Flowing synth washes"
0, Allerpet Let Me Down: It was a pain trying to put Allerpet C on my cats. They hated me every time and promptly licked all of it off. I could see no difference whatsoever in my allergies even after treating the cats twice a week for a month and cleaning my entire house after each treatment
0, Thought a HEPA Air Filter and the Fur-minator Comb worked much better: My boyfriend is allergic to cats. I didn't think this worked that well. My boyfriend says that our HEPA air filter
0, Could be better !: I was a bit dissapointed when I received this book.In text it is absolutely great : a lot of detail in the different stories
1, Its as the picture shows
1, very entertaining for golf nuts: if you read this book in one sitting and then go to the golf course for a round 
0, Not that great!: I bought this thinking I finally found the scraper that would actually do a good job.....dissappointed with the results! Does not work any better than the cheaper scraper that you can purchase from WalMart.
0, Not a good value: I've owned this shredder for about a year. It has been infrequently used and just burned out ... on about 5 sheets. It has NEVER taken the 10 sheets that it purports ... more like 4-6 is max. I will be replacing the shredder
0," Would not load!!!: I had the required software for an update (according to the update software). I had/have MS office Pro 2003 with publisher 2003 and the software would not load. I got a message of ""can not file a file"" and the install set-up would stop and exit.Piece of crap!!! Lucky the seller was willing to give me my money back."
0, Definitely not the one for me.: The design for setting the doors open is flimsy and was unworkable for me. I had it set and baited with peanut butter on crackers and in the morning the doors were still open
1, this little trap does the job!: I was very happy with the trap; successfully caught 8 chipmunks within a week or two. My neighbors even let me know that they are not seeing them in their yards now! I had tried a larger trap but the chipmunks were too lightweight to trip it so they would eat the seed and go on through. I used birdseed in this little cage and it worked fine.
0, Haven't caught a damn thing...: I have caught zero mice. I have seen the mouse almost every night... Usually he/she runs right around the lovely cage. Not sure why I have this...
0, too small for rats: model 1025 is required for rats. I returned my order but the description for 1020 has not been corrected
0, This trap is toy
1, Hav-a-heart mousetrap: Good product. It is a little TOO sensitive and sometimes is hard to set. A little more thought to the set mechanism might find a better and easier solution.
1, Havahart works great!: You really can't improve on this great mouse trap. It catches the mice without any harm and they can be released outside in a safe area. The quakity was a bit better when they were made here in America
1, Compassion feels good and this trap works quite nicely !.: I have caught 7 mice so far in 3 weeks... It's no problem for me to relocate them into the woods with a days ration of peanut butter in their cute little bellies... Mice are very smart and industrious little creatures.... Also
1, works just as intended: I have only had for a week
1, Havahart Trap for Mice: We had a little intruder enter our home. We don't like poison or regular mouse traps so we ordered this humane trap.The trap was a little difficult to put together. It's also slightly difficult to put the bait in since it's small. If you have large hands it's hard to reach in.Other than that
1, Refun Question: I love my Carolina Crocs! I live in Nairobi
0," Alice Cooper Rip-Off.: This guy is such a fake it's not even funny. Almost everything he's done was done before by Alice Cooper. Changing your first name to that of a girl's? Very original...idiot. Makeup? Coop's got that covered. Shock-rock and theatrics in live shows? Oh please. That was done while this guy was a baby.The only thing ""original"" about this guy is his hatred for"
1, i will deliver you know im a forgiver....: this is f@#kin' awesome! personal jesus
1, No Response: This is supposed to be a review of the product but it is a review of Amazon. I ordered a used copy of this CD. I was charged for a new copy. I e-mailed Amazon to find out what happened before even receiving my CD to tell them what's up and received no reply. I'm keeping the CD

0, Outlook 2007 stopped running after automated update: For those considering Outlook 2007
0, stand alone doesn't work: I was mistaken. I bought and installed Office Student Home edition on my 2 new Windows 7 computers. I decided I would still like Outlook for e-mail so I spent the money and bought this software. Well guess what. Since it was not purchased in a bundle
1, Improved Outlook 2007: Improved look and feel. Much easier to set-up email accounts. Easier to organize and manage high volume of messages.
1, Outlook 2007 served me well: I upgraded to Outlook 2007 when it was released because I needed some of the features that it provided. In my experience

0, OUTLOOK 2007 INCOMPATIBLE WITH OFFICE 2003: Installing stand alone Outlook 2007 will corrupt your Office 2003 suite. Tech support will advise you to erase the components of your damaged 2003 in order to install Outlook 2007
0, Unbelievably slow: I added Outlook 2007 to the Office 2007 I installed which didn't come with Outlook. I had been using Office 2003 with Outlook 2003 on an XP system and it had worked fine.Outlook 2007 is incredibly slow to start downloading emails and slow for each email. It may take it 5 minutes to download a couple dozen emails-no attachments or anything. These will download with Mozilla Thunderbird in maybe 20 seconds. And during that time it basically locks up everything else you want to do until it is finished. I've tried turning off everything that has been suggested that may be slowing it down but no success.I'm now using Thunderbird for my emails. Outlook 2007 was so slow the frustration level just got too high.I don't recommend buying this. Outlook 2003 was just fine but Outlook 2007 is a disaster on my machine.
0, Disappointed to the Extreme: I cannot ereally rate the product
0, Clunky: The product is functional; however
0, They call this rain?: I listened to this to help me with sleeping a solid eight hours but to me the rain on this CD sounds like static. So it didn't really help me to get 8 hours of sleep - I figure I get 6 hours of sleep sometimes 5 - the healthy amount of sleep a person should have is 8 hours. So in 10 years I've lost 1 year of sleep & with my life the way it is I should be trying to sleep through as much of it as possible (Ha!).
1, Crisp and refreshing as a midsummer shower: Do you sometimes find yourself standing under the eaves revelling in the beauty of a midsummer storm? Do you find it surprisingly easy and unusually restful to sleep when it is raining outside? If either applies to you
0, too noisy: I thought this would be a thunderstorm recording with a lot of rain and waves etc. but it has all these crickets chirping and its annoying
1, I thought this CD was wonderfull: This cd had the most wonderful
1, Superb shoes: I've bought them for my father. He liked them very much
0, Bad experience with this product: After buying this product vendor was contacted for support or refund on shipping costs due to installatio failure. What they never said was that this product only works with Windows 98 (who has windows 98 nowadays? and who really knows if it is going to work with windows 98?) Vendor never refunded shipping cost. They should not be selling an obsolete product. My guess is that they have a large quantity in stock and are just getting rid of them in any which way the can.

0," DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY: While ""Phat Beach"" has a good premise"
0, just plain silly: I suppose in some literal sense this thing does its job: it keeps your ipod attached to your arm. But once it's there your ipod just flops all over the place. Don't try moving too much--in other words

1, 35 & TICKING: OMGoodness! This movie is funny
1, THE book that changed my life.: This is the book that changed my life. Nothing else has even come close. In very simple
0, Deniro and Pacino walk thru it: This movie wasn't bad but it was hardly the movie that you would want to see Deniro and Pacino wait so long to share screen time on. It was a pretty basic police/serial killer story that tried to keep you guessing but really has been done before. I would rather have seen them sink their teeth into something worthy of their early efforts and all we got was something that was worthy of their latest efforts which haven't been all that great. The movie had a really good cast and Carla Gugino looked great and super sexy as usual.It is worth a watch but if you are expecting The Deer Hunter
0, Love Deniro and Pacino but...: the movie is too predictable. If you are a big fan of either actor
0, bad script: Two great actors with a really bad script
0, Poor: I am not impressed with this mop. A lot of water comes out at one time and soaks the floor. It leaves puddles of water all over. The vacuum part works good. Its light weight and easy to use. I would not buy this product again.
0, What a disappointment!!!: I was so excited to finally get the bucks to buy one of these gadjets. I run a daycare so mopping daily is a necessity! I thought this was an answered prayer. I should've went with Mom's advice and purchased the Hoover!!!Having already owned a Bissell vaccuum
0, What a waste!: I can't believe how excited I was to purchase this vacuum only to be disappointed. The vacuum had no suction...my daughters Barbie vacuum works better. The wet portion of this machine is not any better...definitely not dry ready to walk on. The only good thing about this machine is that I it was easy to take apart and return to the store!!!
0, Waste of MONEY and TIME~!!!!!!!: I have hard floor throughout the entire house both ceramic tile and Laminate wood. I got rid of carpet because it is filthier. I also have two dogs that bring dirt in and out between slight shedding. I have learned about this Unit
0, Flip it...skip it
0, This thing doesn't suck!: The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing
0, Flip it vac.: I am a senior and have used many different vacuum cleaners in my life
1, Bissell FlipIt: The Bissell FlipIt is great for hard floors. I like it as it is light in weight
0, Buy a Mop and a Broom: I bought this to make my life
1," JIM MORRISON FOREVER: THE ORDER WAS EASY TO DO. THE CD CAME QUICKLY. THE ORIGINAL MUSIC WAS GOOD SOUNDS FROM THE ""DOORS"". THE ALTERNATE VERSIONS ADDED A NEW TWIST TO THE DOORS SOUND"

1, Very representative collection: Legacy is certainly very representative of Rick Nelsons wonderful career
0, This one's a stinker: I really love Amanda Quick
0, Not worthy of Tom Clancy: The best part about it is that it is short. Shame on Tom Clancy for allowing his name to be put on this worthless novel.
0, What a waste of money!: It is a pity that a respected author should stoop to putting his name in big letters on the front cover of a book that was very obvoiusly written (badly) by others. I was left with a real sense of having wasted my money.
0, Hildegard was not so boring: The first disc offers a recording of the Ordo Virtutum. The music itself is well performed but the visual aspect does not add anything
0, Annoying bugs!: I bought this CD because a review said there were no annoying loud birds...well
1, One of my all time favorites!: I've used this CD for years: naptime
1, Another Gifted Genius: This Issac Hayes set seems to flow flawlessly between songs. Although
1, Truth in this book by valid repudable psychiatrist: I have known people with children put on drugs like Ritalin since grade school. In high school they were worse and got more diagnosis to last a life time. The parents say they have been compliant on medication and it keeps getting worse and worse and they only get more meds. and diagnosis and the parents can hardly go out of the home without concern for what their children may do.This book helps many. Those who like the drugs are just speculating and don't listen to the stories of how hyperactive children are helped and recover without meds.
1," A great Bob Wills tribute: ""Buddy Emmons Sings Bob Wills"" will satisfy your expectations for what an amazing steel guitar player can do with songs by one of America's greatest songwriters. Buddy's singing makes the listener wonder why he so seldom exercised his vocal talents. I walked into this tribute expecting arrangements that would be heavy on the steel guitar. I was surprised to find conventional versions that give the fiddles"
0, Not what I expected.: This story was a little disappointing. Although it ended on a good note...the meat of it was a little weak. I can't say I enjoyed this book.
0, Pretty bad...Two stars b/c I finished it in one day: Well
1, Great Movie!: I love this movie! It is such a cute movie. They don't make movies like they use to! Love it!

0," DONT MEASURE UP: I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a ""buy together for"" deal. I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings! These were described as 4-5 mm"
0, Horrible mixing: I saw Bryan Duncan perform this morning at my church
1, So Cute: These are so cute. I personally like the purple one better. But thats only because of the pink one's hair do. I like to make it known that I am very soon to be 13 in my reveiws so that people know that some people never outgrow barbie. Any ways I really like these dolls even if thay are a bit expensive. I only have one complaint and that is
0, Finicky: Haven't really been able to use as hoped. Have tried on several occasions but before I really get started the nozzle clogs. Using coal slag as the media which is pretty darn fine...but the second you stop the flow of material with stop it backs up and plugs. Air flow settings are key and just haven't found the settings to make it work yet.
1, Not the best ever!: though many regard this the best live-album ever
0, uggg: twisted off the end that goes into the socket on 2 out of the 3 bars. 3rd bar would do the same for sure
1, Good all around resource: This book seems a little heavy on old images and information
0, Straps too short: I use to buy the Playtex Cross Your Heart bra all the time
1, Great collection of classic tunes!: I really enjoyed this C.D. This brought back great memories of the 60's and early 70's. If you like classic songs with Cal's own flair this is the C.D. for you. Enjoy!
0, save your money: I bought this item locally and I think it is made by Smucker's -- an awful lot of JAM.
0," Warning: Do NOT read!: ""Tartuffe"" by Moliere is a feeble attempt at extrodinary literature. The writing itself is lacking in drama and power"
0, Pretty much useless: You would have thought that with the power of a PC behaind it this will be the most capable navigation program. Unfortunately
0, Check this before taking it to the Streets: Before buying the product
1, Streets and Trips: The streets and trips merchandise was delivered on time and in great condition. We already had the software and it was damaged so this was a perfect replacement.
1, Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 with GPS Locator [DVD]: If you have a Laptop then this is the way to go.Just the size of the screen is reason enoughThe cost @ amazon was the reason I went with it.And it works.
0," It's a lemon: I went through 4 of these while under warranty - the hard drive kept crashing. It's garbage. I'll never buy another ""Maxtor"" back up drive."
0, Mine died too: I was wondering what everyone was complaining about after several months of trouble free usage. Well
0, Don't Bother: I bought this device locally (in Australia) and it is a pile of @#!& having used it for around 3 months it has completely failed.- The Raid 1 functionality is useless as you cannot recover the data without having another Maxtor device- It disappears from the network every day- It is very slow- Maxtor (Seagate) service is rubbish
1, Private Passion by Rochelle Alers: I have been waiting for this novel since I read the last one and I was not disappionted. Ms. Alers has done a wonderful job continuing the Hideaway Legacy Daughters and Sisters Trilogy. This page-turner wonderfully tells the story of the very beautiful and successful Emily Kirkland and the equally handsome and intelligent Christopher Delgado
0, Horrible: No redeeming qualities whatsoever. There are only about a million movies you could buy/rent instead.
1, great movie: this movie has got to be one of the funniest movies of 2001. if i was siskel and ebert i would give it 2 thumbs up. it is hilarious from beginning to end. so if u got 20 bucks to spend gotta go with tomcats....
0, Barely mediocre at very best.: I bought this
0, Disgusting and Depressing: I along with many others read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first. I LOVED it!!! It was one of those books I didn't want to end! I was elated when I found Little Altars everywhere at my local thrift store. I can't believe the diffence between the two!I was caught off guard immediatley with the lesbian chapter. I had no idea that's where R. Wells was taking it. I had to read and re-read where the mother molests Little Shep because I was sure I was taking it the wrong way. I felt sympathy for Vivi in DSYYS
0, a mishmosh of alcoholism
1, Vivi and Siddalee! What a Treat!: I read this book as part of a book club organized by my church. I had never heard of this book before hand. Nevertheless
0, Wish I hadn't read this one at all: I read Little Alters everywhere on recommmendation from a co-worker after reading Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. It almost ruined Divine Secrets for me. Incestuous Vivi is stomach churning. What was Miss Wells thinking? It's practically not the same Vivi-acious character. I recommend the second book highly
0, I wish I had never read it: When I first picked up this book I had this nagging feeling that I should read the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first
0, Rebecca Wells was not subtle enough with her setting names.: My sister-in-law gave me this book
0, Contrived
1," This is a great biography of great mathematian.: Very well written. Gives a great feel for who Hilbert was as a person. It also does a good job of placing his achievments amoung the other mathematians of his time. I have attempted reading a few biography's of other mathematicians that focus on the math and not the person. They are almost unreadable. This book does not make this mistake. I have just bought ""Foundations of Geometry"" because of this book. I highly recommend it. PS - 4 stars is as high a rating as I give. I like having room to move for the truely fantastic."
0, Do not buy this card: Purchased this card - would not work... Period.Company would not supply refund so --- threw my money down the drain.Have built 14 computers and am electrical engineer. Trust me - look elswhere.
0, Fun but stupid: This film is set in the sixties in Cadiz
1, At her peak.: The mix that came together to make this such a special album were the producing and writing team of Ashford and Simpson
1, A Masterpiece: This album is the greatest achievement of Diana Ross' career. Miss Ross sings in a way that she has ever in her career. From the opening track
1, The Boss re-mix will have you singing and dancing.: Truly the re-mix of the Boss is a must for anyone who has every enjoyed the voice of Ross. You will hear talent at its best. Diana's vocals along with wonderful music will set you free. To hear crystal clear Diana's every note on some special tunes as Sparkle and I'm in the world will blow you away. You can actually hear the fun Diana and the musicians were having during their recordings. This CD is very uplifting and you won't believe the excellence! This CD is classic and worth every cent and more.
1, Authentic and moving: I really enjoyed this book. It was fascinating to read about the experiences of a midwife who worked both in hospital and home births.
1, Better Than I Expected: This tape was definitely more effective than I imagined it would be. I perspired (the heater was on
0, I couldn't stand it at all!!: This book made me want to fall asleep! Just like some other reviewers
0, Booring!!!!!!: This is one of the most booring books i have ever read! ONLY read it if you are forced to for school...Why is this book considered a classic? Got me!
1, Classic Look: The author takes a nicely readable and informative look at the classical mythology of Ancient Greece. Readers come away with a strong understanding of the subject
1, long but awesome: long but awesome. action-packed
1, a real classic: I used this book back when I was in highschool in the 80s and had to buy it again to refresh myself. Its a real classic. It has all the great myths. Each one is short and sweet so you can read through the myths you might be wondering about without having to read through long myth stories. The writing style is accessible and colorful. Definitely and enjoyable read.
1, Good start: Always a good starting place. Missing some key elements to several myths but this is mostly a factor of directing it toward a 1950s audience.
1, the best by the very best: this cd is a great sound by the greatest singer of of our time. be assured once you listen to waylon sing and touch your very soul you will have to agree you are listening to very best. waylon's sound will stand the test of time. enjoy
0, am I crazy or did people actually like this?: first off...let me say I am a huge everclear fan. I've seen them live plenty of times and love every record they put out. That said...I've listened to this record twice and tried my hardest to like it....but after two attempts...I sold it back..the songs don't make any sense to me...they have no flow and just basically sound like noise I could make in my basement....after seeing all of the positive reviews I feel someone has to take the other side of the debate
0, The worst packaged band of the last seven years: Ahh well Everclear the masters of three chords
1, Excellent CD filled with great riffs & melodies...: This album is harder than volume 1
1, A Must-Buy for fans of pure
1, The best: We've owned various pruning shears over the years and were never totally pleased with their performance. I've had a chance to use the Felco F-2 and it works like it should. Clean cuts every time. Highly recommend - worth the extra bucks !
1, Best hand pruner I've ever had!: This hand pruner is wonderful! It cuts through 1 inch branches like butter
1, A Tool that works as it should: Having used many brands of pruners through the years I think I have found the perfect tool. Sharp blades
1, Bought for husband
0," I Can't Believe Julia Roberts Starred in ""The Mexican."": As a Julia Roberts' fan"
1, What's not to like?: I cannot even begin to understand what people do not like about this film. Is it an epic? nah. It is funny? you bet it's funny. Maybe that's why so many people here have panned it. A lack of a sense of humor in the subtleties of humor. There is a lot of wry wit in this
0, OK Idea
0, can't just make it happen ....: Its obvious the filmakers bet on chemistry between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and a clever screenplay to carry this movie - unfortunately the chemistry just isnt there between these two and the screenplay
0, An amazingly stupid movie: The Mexican has to be the worst movie ive seen this year. I rented it cause JAmes Galdofini was in it.HE was the best actor in this film thus the one star.Even though I find him unbeleivable as a gay he was good as his role.Brad Pitt sucked as the bumbling nerd and I usually think he's good.Julia Roberts overacts in this movie BIGTIME and is a little too much for me.The plot has some major holes.....{like how does Brad Pitt know the charecter Leroy died in the hotel?}and uttterly makes little sense.I didn
0, Once Upon a Time in Mexico: This movie got some attention since it has two big Hollywood stars in it
0, How not to understand Madhymika: This book attributes inconsistent premisses to Madhaymika
1, Great gift for your Nascar lover: I searched all over my local stores for something like this. The challenge was many local memorabilia stores have closed down due to the economy. I was so excited to find it online. It was delivered very timely. The packaging was impeccable. The color and detail is brilliant. We cannot wait to hang it in our Nascar room.
1, A great entertainer: I wish people would stop going on about how Garth isn't country
1, Damn Yankees: i remeber
1, Damm Yankees: I was very pleased with the product. The DVD quality was like new the only small problem is it was a gift and the case itself was smashed in on one side.
1, The Destroy a Rolls Royce: This was the directorial debu for film legend Ron Howard he also stars in it along with borther Clint Howard and Maryion Ross makes an apperance in it(she was Maryion Cunningham on Happy Days)they destroy some of the best cars in the world in this film including a Rolls Royce
0, hey what happend here?: this movie is called grand theft auto
1, .Great product: This item is terrific. It fit right into the box I had from my old shredder and I'm very happy with it.
0, Terrible!: This adapter didn't work at all when I got it. So just for the heck of it I took it apart to maybe see what was the problem and the antenna is only there for looks. It isn't even attached. haha dumbest thing i've ever seen. This is why the other person that rated this doesn't get good reception. The only good thing about this transaction was that the company I bought them from credited me without even returning them. Very promptly too.they probably realized they were junk too. haha Surprisingly walmart sells a very nice adapter for $20.00. This is cheaper (after shipping) easier
1, Give it a whirl.: This is a cute book with pretty good characters. What made it for me
1, IT'S ALL GOOD!!!!: I THINK THAT HIS CD'S ARE GREAT AND HE'S GOT A GREAT TALENT. MY MOST FAVORITE SONG IS THE DANCE!KEEP IT UP GARTH! I LOVE YOU!!!
0, VERY AVERAGE: I'M Hardly A Fan OF Garth Brooks Music.cuz all of his Albums sound the exact same.in fact for me he has had only 5 Good solid songs for his Career.but two of them are Here on this Debut.The Dance which is a Great song.& If Tomorrow never comes.that songs is very honest.in fact My favorite of his.but the rest of the Album just Like the rest of His Music is pure Formula&Predictable.
0, Don't buy this book: I found out I was having twins and ran to the bookstore. Having Twins...was the thickest volume I could find on the topic. Reading it left me depressed
0, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!: In all the years I've been buying books from Amazon
0, Good firestarter: This book was the most judgemental source of crap I've ever read. Does the author even have children? Rather than providing the pro's and con's to situations
0, HORRIBLE: Shouldn't pregnancy books be unbiased
0, No recommended: Poorly organized and out of sequence. Author makes strange suggestions such as put your children in a box or drawer if you dont have a bassinet. Discurrages circumcision. Negatively writes about invetro... what century is the writer in???
0, Borrow it from the library if you have to...: I would strongly suggest that you do not buy this book until you have had a chance to borrow it from the library and skim through it. I would say that more than 90% of soon-to-be parents out there will agree with all the negative reviews and would say it was a waste of money.
0, Hard to find good info: I received this book as gift when I found out I was pregnant with twins. I am horribly disappointed. The author just fills the book with her radical left-wing opinions (like we should not drink another animal's milk
1, WOW...now this is how folk elements shoould be modernized: This is simply a beautiful album along side all the other releases of Kismet; North Atlantic Baltic Express

1, God Bless America!: During this time of uncertainty in our nation
0, Not worth the money: The book is mainly about the author. He wants to make a book out of maybe 4-5 encounters with Feynman.
1, Inspiiring: This is an inspiring book
1, Quality is fantastic: These were bought as a Christmas gift for my wife and I was so pleased with the quality of the earings and the packaging of them.
0, Too hard to navigate - buy another one!: Received as gift for holidays
1, Finally the perfect little girl barbie !: I have two grandaughters
1, Excellent follow up to Super Are: Vision Creation Newsun follows the new course the boredoms took with Super Are into long rock-trance sonic collages. I don't know of any other music produced today that is simultaneously so experimental and exciting. Although miles apart stylistically
1, This book does work if you work it: This book was awesome . I read it in a few days. It is well written and very practical. It has helped me immensely in stopping big arguements with my family. But I review and practice the principles. If someone says it does not work
1, Like a low-budget Sesame Street episode: Like any Sesame Street episode
1, I love Plaza Sesamo: The video is exactly like Sesame Street in english the program is great for introducing new vocabulary and understanding the words in Spanish. I bought this for my five year old son. Although I recommend getting the alphabet because knowing the sounds of each letter is important in Spanish pronuncation.
1, Good DVD: I bought this DVD for my niece who has moved away from her Spanish speaking grandmother. The first time I played it she sat enthralled: danced
1, I Am A Big Garth Fan.: This Is His Best Selling Album To Date. This Album Sold Over 10
1, Complete Heart and Soul.: Garth Brooks knows how to sing right into the heart and soul of the average person. He knows Love and Heartbreak. Personally
0, As a singer and songwriter he's a great rhythm guitar player: Jerry Garcia was a stone cold genius. The Grateful Dead was his backup band. Bob Weir's solo work is easily as good as the solo work of Bill Wyman
1, works great so far: I got this for Christmas and finally got my package off Italian herb seeds last month. Everything but the thyme is growing very well. The basil is very tall and full. The mint is doing great. Oregano is going wild. The thyme is growing but looks a little sickly. I'm thinking of getting another one after reading that strawberries are now available.
0, disappointed: I purchased the 7-pod AeroGarden approx. five weeks ago. I immediately set it up which was very simple to do. I inserted the pods and added the water and nutrients tablets as instructed. I saw sprouts take place within a week as expected. I check everything daily anticipating growth....well this is where we are very disappointed. After five weeks the plants grew to heights of only 1 1/2 inches at best. They seem dormant
0, Nothing like those commercials: I have had my Aerogarden for about nine months. I am definitely not impressed. I planted my first set of gourmet herbs which came with the garden
0, Linguistic Anthropology: This is an example of a textbook done on the cheap. There is no index
0, Inside itself: 2 1/2With few exceptions
0, The Beginning of the End: The writing was on the wall by the time Peace and Love was released
1, Quite the decent album...: While this doesn't compare to the older stuff
1, It's a dandy: Nice
0, Tedious: This authour has a workmanlike style. While I was interested in the subject matter
1, Great for Camping: I got this for camping because I was tired of using expensive throw away tanks that didn't hold much gas.This one is a great compact size and costs about [...] to fill up. It is more than 4 times the capacity of the smaller ones yet still costs less to fill up then to buy one of the smaller ones.The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price (although it will eventually pay for itself). Also sucks that Coleman makes you buy another [...] attachment to attach to their stoves.
0," very missleading ad: I have purchased 3 I thought its feather bed pad something as the description but its end up to be only a cover so its just not good to buy online "" on Amazon""because you can't really expect what you are gonna get. please becareful"
0," Not worth it: This is not a ""fat burning"" yoga session. If you want a strenuous"
1, Great yoga!: I would recommend the Crunch-Fat Burning Yoga DVD for anyone - whether it's your first yoga attempt or you are at a higher level of yoga. It's interesting and easy to follow and you feel like you've done your stretches as well as burned some fat after you've finished the DVD. Sara Ivanhoe is a great instructor and you don't get tired of her.Try it - you'll be recommending it to your friends.
1, Good for beginners: I just got this tape yesterday. I watched it first before I actually worked out with it; I really didn't think I would get that much out of it. It was a challenging workout
0, Good only for a slow day: I found this yoga workout to be great option for a day I'm not motivated for a tough workout. But
0, Beware of offensive language: The story of two towns in Michigan - St. Joseph and Benton Harbor - geographically close but racially worlds apart. St. Joseph is 95% white
0, Terrible dark book: This book was awful. I can't believe anybody liked it. I will never buy another book by this author. It was really an awful book.
1, Enjoyable read: I enjoy Catherine Anderson's books and this one didn't disappoint. The fear that the heroine had of her brother-in-law was a little over the top but then back then a female wasn't always listened to. The end of the trial was a little unbelievable and wrapped up a little to pat but overall the book was still enjoyable.
1, This was really....: This was a really really really good book. It is sad and funny. It is one of my favorite books.
1, Mick Harte Was Here: Mick Harte was one of the neatest kids you would ever want to meet. He went trick-or-treating as Thomas Crapper
0, Not worth your time or money: I kept reading hoping to find something of importance but zip. The weightloss solutions are to find a fad diet out there that you like. The exercises are nothing new. Save your money and go take a yoga class.
0, Booring: I found this book to be exceedingly booring. I felt like I was reading someones facebook. I was unable to finish the book.
1," Perfect Pouch with 3 carrying options: I don't like wearing a ""tool belt"" all the time and often lost tools when my lumbering gait bounced tools right out of my bags. This solved that problem by allowing me to zip the whole thing shut when wearing it with a belt"
0, i feel sorry for people.....: i seriously feel sorry for the not-bright people that have been brainwashed by the evil my scene creators who think that they can get rich quick by making and manufacturing these loads of crap
0, I HATE MY SCENE!!: Ok
0, lol this is gross: this is gross cuz its pretty. pretty is bad. i hate my scene they are not ugly like bratz bratz rawk they made me skinny and obsessed with my fashion sense lol lol lol lol!!!!!
0, educational? yeah...but in all the wrong ways!: and we wonder why we have all these young ladies prancing around in nothing but little mini skirts and teeny shirts! if we teach little girls that dressing like a HO is how you are supposed to dress
1, Barbie goes to a party: What little/big girl doesn't love to play dress up just like this Barbie. Since dress up is a part of growing up
0, BAD HAIR!: I recently bought this toy for my daughter. When I took the doll out of the box her hair was a mess! I tried to brush it out but it didn't work. The doll is now on the floor totally ignored with messy hair!
1, My favorite book: This was my favorite book as a child. While moving out of my parent's house a while back
1, My fiance loves it.: Ok - being a guy
0, Where's the goods???: They have had this in the works for years
1, A stylish and distinctive glass: These lightweight
1, Versitile Glassware: We had 2 of these tumblers
0, Nice In Theory
1, Also good for your morning orange juice: My ordinary juice tumblers are wearing out
0, These glasses are way too fragile.: These glasses were terribly disappointing. They are so thin and delicate that I am afraid to wash them. The base is so unsteady that you feel uncomfortable about setting them down. I have found the solution - do not use them - they suck.
1, a bit less of a masterpiece than his others: Okay
1, Not quite total delirium
1, Among my most favorite albums: I bought this album not knowing what to expect
0, Not That Great: I was not even sweating at the end of this workout - I found the moves to be out of synch - they did not flow easily from one to another - I was a dancer and fitness instructor for years and I found these moves very uncoordinated. The weights were picked up and put down too many times during the workout also
1, My favorite of the Crunch series: I have tried each and every one of the video workouts from the Crunch series--every time
0, A Victoria's Secret catalog would be more enticing...: I read reviews from other people on the stuff they sell on Amazon
0, Stay away: A lot of the books on the bookshelves don't belong there-- some belong in your homes others the trash. This one is really bad. Larry Williams is a direct marketer not a trader. If you want to learn how to trade read Market Wizards
0," He lost me at the ""moon"" signal: There is some interesting material on using the COT report to help identify trends"
1, Pancakes Anyone?: I have recently become a fan of the WoodWick Candles. They are asthetically very pretty. I also like candles that smell like I've been baking. However
1, Still better than the Granada Studios version: Despite other Sherlockians' complaints that Matt Frewer cannot fill the shoes of Jeremy Brett
0, A Misleading Threat to Depressed Patients Everywhere: Dr. Breggin never prescribes psychotropics. He therefore has no experience with any. Untreated depression has a hard outcome
1, awsome: full of action
1, UNREAL: This is a story every bit as fascinating as Donnie Brasco. Should also be a movie. Living undercover as a Mongel member for two years with those dirty drunken drug users had to be an awful extistence. Or maybe it was fun. However it was
1, Fast-Paced and Fascinating: I loved it. The writing is crisp and concise
1, A true Mongol: This was a great read. William Queen tells his story honestly
1, Under and Alone....fiction?: Over all I really enjoyed this book...for entertainment purposes.Parts of the story line conflicted. I do believe that if discoverd he would have been killed. I don't believe for a second that he did 28 months with out ever doing drugs seeing how drugs were such a HUGE part of this chapter's life style. I also believe that IF the HAMC really wanted to
1," Above and Beyond...: What a great read. The amount of courage it took to infiltrate a violent gang is just incredible. To become and function as a ""Patched"" member is on the borderline of insanity"
1, Must Read!!! DONT PASS ON THIS BOOK!!: This is a must read book about a phenomenal investigators journey into the bowels of the biker gang underworld. Non stop thrill ride from start to finish!
0, The butchering of a masterpiece: The reason that this film lacks cohesion between the animation and live action
0, Conservation book: The book is fine for beginners in the conservation genetics.So the price
1, To appreciate the mind is everything.: We do Family Development training (comprehensive case management) to staff at Community Action Agencies (mostly not-for-profits) providing vital human services to low-income families so they can become more self-sufficient. We certify these staff as Family Development Specialists through training and testing. Though these people are not mental health therapists
0, Laughably awful: All the people on this page who have given this movie a positive review must be members of the directors family. This movie was terrible.I have wasted too long thinking about it already so I can't be more specific.
0, The Book of the Trite: This book is awful! It's 'Silence of the Lambs' meets 'Dark Shadows' meets Ann Rice's witches' series - with none of the originality of any of them. The characters are ridiculous stereotypes from soap operas and cop shows. Their names are hard enough to swallow
0," Pretentious and long-winded: The alternate title of this book should have been ""HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS"".An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with ""Cabinet of Curiosities"". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent"
1, Incredible conclusion to the Diogenes trilogy: While this chapter of the trilogy almost had the feel of Relic in the beginning
1, Great Stanley tradition: Great album with only a couple of minor low points. Not bad for a 2 CD set. You more than get your moneys worth... Ralph could have had a couple more musicians instead of show casing his son so much
1, Very good: Very cute
0, These are not the black connectors youre looking for: For those of you looking for black connectors to replace the white connectors that come with the new 06 series of Fluval filters this is NOT the right product. The picture is wrong.
0, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT: After listening to several other Celtic Christmas music selections on the web
0, Slow and boring: I did not know what to really expect from this book. It was painfully slow and boring. It did not grab my attention. It took me a very long time to finish this book
0, Mattel is more of a copier: Mattel copies everything the Bratz do. And the Bratz dolls did sort of copied Barbie dolls
1," Serene and Sexy: This album grows on me the more I hear it. She has a new slant on some old favorites that are becoming MY favorites! She also has put some songs together that I've never heard before (""Some Cats Know"
1, Well-made and inexpensive!: This caddy fits the bill just perfectly. I couldn't bring myself to spend three times as much for the Bob-branded version
1, Effective and Better than the Original: This is a fantastic movie full of atmosphere and some real food for thought. In fact
1, You just can't beat live Albert King: You just can't beat live Albert King. He may not be the most technically competent guitar player that ever walked the earth
1, Old school at its best: Sounds of Success is what this band gives you in this CD. I love the old school brass sound and these guys give it.
1, SOS BAND: I love the SOS band. I have been wanting their greatest hits Cd for some time
1, Back in the day music: Love old school music and it was great hearing these songs! Brought back lots of memories and some BIG smiles.
0, best of SOS Band: The sound is low quality
1, I Finally Found It!!!: I went through high school listening to the great music of the SOS Band. I listen to it at least once a day at work. This is a great CD
1, It's missing several good Southern fight songs!: Appalachian State
0, Sad: I was looking forward to hearing these cds for some time... The Wonder Years would have been nothing without those poignant songs
0, Interesting setting but rather predictable plot: I was quite disappointed with this book
0, Not Crichton's best work: I found the story line had an interesting prospect
0," Schlock: THIS is an author who writes ""literature"" according to Amazon's pre-publicity for Crichton's Timeline. Ha!"
0, Horribly Written: I couldn't even get half way through it. Bland characters
0, Chrichton disappoints this reader: I have read a few of Crichton's books
1, You feel like your on rollor coster: Crichton writes a novel to full trill. Congo is a major example of Crichton's knowledge. Congo is like a rollor coster. It start with a uphill battle of man over life. Then it twistes and turn and when you thanks it's over
1," The first book of a first-rate novelist: Carol Shields' won the Pulitzer Prize for ""The Stone Diaries"" in 1995. ""Small Ceremonies"" was her first novel"
1, little dimmer than I am: It worked good until it got dropped. More decretive than practical in a power failure
1, Good quallity
1, Yes it is funny: As a comedy this movie delivers. I review movies for my part time job and after seeing 10+ movies a week
1, Very Funny: I picked this movie up last week after seeing the blu-ray previews on TV. It started and ended w/ hilarious lines. The middle of the film was no slouch either. Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd prove to be a formidable comedy duo.
0, Morally depraved garbage: Where do i start with this mindlessly pathetic film ? If you enjoy young kids and adults spouting crude and vulgar language mixed with moral depravity then this brain-dead flick is you cup of tea. For me I found it repulsive
1, Hilarious!: I love this movie- it wasn't that big in theaters but everyone I know thinks it's funny. Sort of dark humor but hilarious
1, Stiffler...: Stiffler(Sean William Scott) from American Pie and Paul Rudd were great stars to match up in this hilarious movie.
1, Lucky Texan: I give Lucky Texan four stars. I love John Wayne movies
0, Yeah
1, TURN UP THE HEAT: I actually really loved this movie. obviously it's not going to win any oscar nominations but if you enjoyed the other wild things movies you should enjoy this one too or why even watch this far into the series. i enjoyed the great looking babes and good looking guys trying to do each other in for the money. greed for money and hunger for sex seem to rule the day for these floridians. and it's more so greed for money.even though theres plenty of sexy scenes in this movie. i enjoyed the whole wild thing series and hope they make another one but make it a full 2 hours instead of an hour and thirty two minutes. let's see more please.great exotic locations
1," The ""JOY"" That Is Isaac Hayes: i just got my copy of this album.....YIKES!the opening track.....nothing short of a 15- minute SEDUCTION!i suggest thee get it.......NOW!"
0, Just OK: I bought this for my son-in-law who thought it was fine but the one I have is much wider and I think better for carrying wood.
1, non-traditional use: I have wanted a log carrier like this for a long time to use to store my hammock and works perfectly. I have a traditional hammock with wooden spreaders. I like to store my hammock when it is not being used
1, very durable log carrier: This is a really tough carrier. Well made. It allows me to bring quite a few logs in at a time. Most of the mess stays in the carrier. I just empty it outside. I wish it were just a little wider to be able to fit longer logs.
1, City Kitty Is a Must: This doll is not really for little kids. I say if the child is about 9 or older. There are little parts. Other than that this doll is a great source of fun. She comes with another outfit so you can have fun redressing her. The real eyelashes are another plus it makes her a casual or dressy redress project. You can have hours of fun with these dolls.
0, one joke pony: I am SO glad I rented this an didn't buy it. I wanted this movie to be funny
1, Great buy: Bought these as a gift and my daughter says they are exactly what she wanted. Both durable & attractive. Exactly as advertised. Another winner for Amazon!
1," Soothing and relaxing: This CD combines natural sounds and light instrumentals to produce a sleep inducing effect. Let yourself listen and relax as the ""music"" takes you away."
1," A wonderful Christmas Compilation: Three reasons I originally purchased this CD - BNL with Sarah McLachlan ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" - an impromptu recording backstage at a '96 concert"
0, One great song
1," Great valve: I have a 22gpm hydraulic pump and a 4"" diameter 30"" stroke cylinder on my log splitter. I timed it with a stopwatch and this valve allows me to have a 10 second cycle time (out and in"
1, Pretty good study aid: This study aid has a good breadth of coverage of concepts covered by the MCAT. The questions are all in the style of the MCAT (Roman numeral questions
1, Incredible: Pedro the Lion fully accomplishes what they've been striving for. The cd captured me the first time i listened to it with its country-folk style story telling and beautiful guitar playing. A must have for its fans
1," Greatest Hits from the greatest band: Here are the greatest hits from the one and only dc Talk. It highlights the bands ""Free At Last"""
1, Missing a couple tracks: I know
0," overated band: When the mainstream radio stations started playing ""Jesus Freak"" Toby Mckennan was quick to accept the comparison to the late great Kurt Cobain.Considering the two men are miles apart politically"
0, Nothing to be excited about: Pros: Can't think of any (ummm...maybe the vivid colors
1, Motorstorm review: Great game awesome graphics
0, More Frustrating Than Fun: The game features incredible graphics and a wide variety of vehicles but that's about it. It is clear programmers took a lot of short cuts such as using the same tracks over and over and over... They also used the age old (and very unrealistic) trick of having the computer controlled vehicles vary their speed based on your success. The better you do
1, Fantastic
1, Great Book!: This is one of those books that I ended up staying up late for. You'll find yourself laughing
0," copy cats: I know that my scene lovers are not going to like this review but i seriously think that my scene dolls are trying to copy the ""Bratz"" dolls"
1, Great Product: Great Product
1, K.I.S.: Need a simple ceiling projector mount for your conference room or multifunction room? This is it; after doing some research decided on the Vantage Point product and had our projector installed in less than 30 min. Two small points for improvement:1) They need better instructions. There was not enough explanation on what parts to use with different projectors.2) Easier fine tune adjustments for aiming the projector.Overall for the money a great projector mount.
1, Farberware toaster: This is the best toaster I have ever had. It toasts bagels and bread evenly and the bagels never get stuck in the slots. I would buy this toaster again.
1, Great for those interested in religious history: Read this book in one setting after visiting St. Paul's Bassilica in Rome. The author certainly brought St. Paul to life on the pages.
1, Wild Ravens a Winner: For Ms. Washington's first historical novel
1, Wild Ravens: Altonya Washington has done it again. My favorite stories from her are the ones that take place in the late 1800's. She is a very gifted writer. I found myself so fasinated by the characters in the book that I found it difficult to put it down. The romance between the main characters was wonderful. All I can say is that I want more.
0, Opened box: This is open box(not new). The board wasn't sealed in plastic
0, Platinum Trim probably being discontinued: BEWARE: I too was thrilled to see the Platinum trim Holiday china
1, Must read: Uno de los generos mas dificiles son las novelas policiacas. Padura trabaja muy bien el personaje principal Mario Conde y a la misma vez retrata como es la vida en la habana.Esta novela es parte de la tetralogia cuatro estaciones
0, Disappointed: Yes the Hamsterz are cute...but after a while they do and say the same things
1, Better than expected: I wanted this game for a while
0, Don't buy it.: I bought this CD a month ago
1, Works like a charm: Bought a similar product from a different vendor - big mistake. Should know better and stick with Amazon vendors from the beginning. Item was received ahead of schedule
1, Good but could have been better: The movie is good but in many parts unbelievable. Its just like Agatha Cristie's 10 Little Indians. A group of people are getting paid a big lot of money to stay in a very ODD haunted house for a night. This movie is one big block of swiss cheese because there are so many plot holes. Even with them it is still a great movie. It is a little scary but it must have been very scary in that time. Believe it or not there are BLOODY heads. Its kind of suprising for the time it was in. The ending is well.... unfinished as I said the plot holes could have been filled up. Anyways it is a great movie.
1, Great VHS: This movie is a classic 1959 horror starting Vincent Price about spending one night in the haunted house you last one night you get $10
0, Don't Open the Package: Lame collapsing action prevents this standing upright once removed from the supportive packing.
0, Agree with other bad reviews: This toy is not fun for a little person. It won't stay together at all; even when you turn the crank to tighten the strings
0, Won't Stand Up: The joints on this toy are made out of string and are only loosely connected. Very hard to make stand. It just falls down and looks like a dinosaur corpse.
1, Spitfire
0, Hate this shampoo: I HATED this shampoo. My dermatologist recommended that I purchase this after having problems with my scalp. I used this shampoo and it was EXTREMELY DRYING to my hair. It left white residue in my hair and on my scalp. After the shampoo left the white residue in my hair it was also sticky.....I then had to wash my hair with a sulfate shampoo to remove the residue. My hair is natural and the key ingredient in this line is Sodium Hydroxide one of the main ingredients in Perms for black people and when you are natural you do not want that stuff on your hair because it breaks down the protein in our hair. I was so panic stricken and never used this product again. I had to return this shampoo and the conditioner. When my scalp flare up I now just use what I have always used and that is Neutroogena T-Gel shampoo
1, I don't know: This has been prescribed by my doctor for scalp problems. I don't know if it's working because my scalp still itches but it isn't getting worse just not better.
1, A Fantastic CD-ROM set!: By all means
1, Outstanding!: Frank Miller
0," In Retrospect -- Hypocritical: Now that we know that President Clinton and Madeline Albright fought and succeeded to have the word ""genocide"" removed from all UN talk about Rwanda"
1, Student perspective: A well organised and thorough explanation of finite element concepts from fundamental principles. Lacks worked examples for applications of the concepts
1, Inversions: This is a fun book to have
1, Love's Enduring Promise: As a sequel to Love Comes Softly
1, Another Great Movie: I cant say enough about the Love Series. I look forward to watching the next one.
1, Wonderful book that takes place in my area.: This was the story of Richard Henry Dana who the doctor recomends to sign up to become a sailior. He goes on the ship the Pilgrim which has hide trade and he tales of the hardships of the sea. A few years ago my school had a field trip to the replica to the Pilgrim and we got to stay over night to see how it felt to be a sailior. I was in a group called the hidegathers and we got to go out in a small rowboat..it was quite exciting.
0," Thare She Blows!: This book was so boring it was unmetionable. I bought this book because everyone said it was a great ""american"" classic. The first half of the book was great"
1, VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERN!: This is my first movie of USA to watch. I like it . . . very much. Reminds me of me early days. Makes me wish I was 10 years younger.
1, Dear God: If you heard Dog Fashion Disco for the first time
1, A Counselor from Memphis
0, jiveness: This album is not funky nor is it soulful. Lame. Unhip. It is a travesty. They had so much to work with and put together so little. If you like 70s elevator music
0, Wasting your money if you buy H2Oc: If you search the internet you will find many complaints about this product. Just stops connecting with satellites and the Customer Support response is send it in with $180 and we will replace it. Some have sent theirs back multiple times in warranty. Unfortunately mine was just out of warranty when it died. Will never own Lowrance products again.
0, I might have liked it: ...if I had been able to stay awake for the whole thing. I watched this movie while it was raining and I was too sick to do much else
0, Don't listen to the hype: This movie was a total disapointment. It is a sad story
1, Gut wrenching
0," Smells worse than a cargo hold of rotting fish.: To quote Kevin Kline in ""Fish Called Wanda"""
0, What a Horrible Movie.: I was kinda excited to see this film heard it had great special effect's and a good movie. What a Joke this has to be the single worst movie i think i have ever seen. The plot was terrible the special effects were just as bad i am glad i rented it and did not buy it. Do yourself a favor and bypass this one......
0, Reality check: CGI has it's limitations when it comes to something non organic like the sea. European director makes masterpiece. Hollywood beckons. He arrives. Makes cack film about astronaut on pile of expensive rocks. Then highjack of airforce one by Gary Oldman on an acting break. Then this film with man getting foot stuck in shark's gob. This then
0," Worst movie I've seen in a very long time: Worst movie I've seen in a very long time. I mean this was ""Ghost"" bad.The only joy I got out of this thing was the the badly forced New England accents.And Diane Lane seemed more like Marky Mark's mom than wife."
0, Storming Out: I'll sum it up fast and easy - not a good movie! As a matter of fact
0, Y A W N !: I could not suspend reality even for a second here. The whole thing is way too contrived. It made me happy my DVD player has a big fast forward button.
0, Great special effects! Great movie....well.....: In a nutshell
0," The perfect Bomb: The definitive over the top interpretation of a true story. Like so many films of this genre the audience are being treated as gullible idiots. There are limits to temporary suspension of disbelief. As the boat negotiates its way through 100+ foot waves crew members sit below deck at a table where mugs aren't even moved by the storm. The last time I had seen the ocean manipulated in this way by computers was in the directors cut of ""Abyss"" where aliens created a 1000 foot static wave to intimidate mankind"
1, Lovely aroma: I am very happy with this peach tea. I have had many brands in the past and Peach Lift is one of the best that I have had. I will surely look up Peach Lift when I am ready to purchase again.
0, Slightly improved: 'Stonecutter's Story' is better than the previous two 'Swords' books. The plot is more interesting and Saberhagen uses more dialogue to move the story along
0, A Major Disappointment: I've read all of the Dune books (by Frank Herbert) and the previous prequel series by the son and friend. The earlier prequel series
1, Good Story - Read it if you like Dune: I liked the book immensely. A lot of the negative reviews I've read here make valid points
0, Good thing I can trade this thing in&#65533;.: After I finished this book (which didn't take long) I resolved that this was the LAST one I was ever going to waste my money on. I've put up with these new Dune books
0, Not worth the time: I've made it half way through the book and am not sure I can finish it. I was quite pleased with the first Dune prequel-triology and so I anticipated this one would be up to that calibre. There are
0, Not the best of the Dune Series: While I thoroughly enjoyed the first three prequels written by the duo (and the original Dune series)
0, Feh!: Absolutely horrible. Both fans of the series and the elder Herbert's memory would have been better served by an edited version of the latter's notebooks
1, I happened to like the book!: I noticed that quite a number of people were complaining about the quality of The Butlerian Jihad. Many are saying that it can't hold a candle to the original books. My response to that is at least the damn thing is readable! I've read the first four Dune books and the characters are severely two dimentional. The futuristic babbling is to Dune what technobabble is to Star Trek. At least Star Trek uses it effectively. They've never had a whole episode dedicated to it. While reading the Dune series I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters! I have no idea why people have declaired this one of the greatest sci-fi series ever. I find the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Andersen novels more rich and alive than any of the original Dune novels. If you want a good read
0, Butlerian Johad Review: I'm only a quarter of the way into the book and I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it. The plot is weak and the action weaker yet. Many of the descriptions are irrelevant and I'm finding the book terribly verbose. The characters are so thin they're practically transparent. The science is weak to non-existent. The battle tactics are unbelievable. The style lacks the craftsmanship you'd expect from even a journeyman writer. I could go on
0, Ripped Off: The DVD by Platinum Disc Corporation of The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery starring Steve McQueen with a shot on the case from his role in The Getaway (1972) is only 1/2 a movie
0, For the love of the kill: The author is unable to grasp the true concept of a psychopath.He tries by using explicit language
1, Loader: This item is typical of Fisher Price - good construction and the boys love them. I wanted to make a note of the handle to push the cars around with - great design. If you are familiar with toddlers they push down hard and foward and it makes some vehicles difficult to roll. The handle is perfect as it still allows the vehicle to move forward even though they are pushing down so hard.
0, Not impressed: I used to be a big proponent of Netgear. Not anymore. First off
0," NETGEAR VPN05L ProSafe VPN Client Software: We purchased a Netgear FVS114 VPN Firewall and VPN Client package (VPN05L) from CDW on 25 Jan 2008. We are told by Netgear Tech Support that the BIOS was changed in the device and it is no longer ""stable"". The previous BIOS version is no longer available. They are unable to resolve the problem (netgear tech support case: 6614329).I used to consider NETGEAR to be a quality vendor"
1, Enemy at the Gates: Maybe oneof the best war movies ever made. This one has to be seen to appreciate what the Russian front at Stalingrad was like in WWII.
1, Very Interesting War Movie: Now
0, Even if you LURVE Jude Law
1, On its own merit: Great MOVIE. Movies should never be compared to the books. The books are always better. Several books have such awesome characters and stories that you just need to see them on the screen. This is one of them. It's one person's interpretaion of the book. Still a damn good movie. I liked it better than Saving Private Ryan.
0, Complete waste of time.: I thought that someone trying to make a period film would do at least some reading about the period and/or the historical events. Boy
0, Dreadful.: I had high hopes for this because I usually love Jude Law movies. This is just one long
0, disappointing: The Amazon review got it right - this is essentially a cat and mouse thriller set within an epic battle. Beyond that
1, beautiful useful bag: We bought this briefcase as a gift for a close friend. He loves it! It has a sleek look and the inside is phenomenal. It is really roomy and is made well.
0, got beat on money: i bought 2 sets of this product ..when i recieved them they were flimsy ..very cheaply maid so i sent them back ..i got credit returned for one set never the other one ..i wrote letters withno response back ...whats the problem...? I paid for 2 sets 
0, Disapointing: This series is a sorry replacement for the original. Aside from Stewart Finlay-McClelan
1," Parliament Rocks!: ""Osmium"" is a great glimpse into early Parliament. It sounds more San Francisco psychedelic rock than Detroit R&B funk in places"
1, Komeda = great music
0, Potential plagiarism mars strong advice: Ms. Chatman-Whitfield takes a comprehensive look at the wedding planning business in an easy-to-read format that ought to be helpful to beginners. Unfortunately
0, Don't Bother: Although this book seems like a good idea in principle
1, The Paperclip Conspiracy: what an eye-opener! never imagined that the book will be so interesting and so revealing. I was under the impression that the scientists
0, This Guy is Into Himself: This is a high pressure sales pitch for a guy who is obviously into himself. For someone from a Hutterite-Mennonite like background
0, Alex Haley: Plagiarist: Unfortunately
1, An important story...: ...even if the specifics of Haley's geneology aren't true. It's obvious while reading the book that Haley fictionalizes much of the account of Kunte Kinte's life in Africa
1, traumatic.: having developed a love for historical fiction
1, Fascinating
1, The author is Alex Haley.... the great book is ROOTS!: The epic saga Alex Haley has written reaches deep into heart of history

1, Great product!: I bought this closet rod and had no trouble installing it. Measuring is not an issue since it is adjustable.
1, An excellent insider's guide to understanding Congress: I'm a chief of staff to a Member of the House of Representatives. I give a copy of this book to every new staffer who comes to work in our office
1, Hot Blues!: Albert King recorded this CD on Wednesday June 26
1, Great value for money: I bought this raclette grill
1, Great evening with friends!: This Hamilton Beach Raclette Party Grill is an excellent product. I researched the various products available and picked this one since the reviews pointed out the quality of the product. Specifically with some other products the top grill would warp. I have used this grill many times. We cook beef slices and shrimp on the top while melting cheese in the little pans beneath the grill. It works fantastically. It has a variable heat option which is very helpful in deciding how hot you want to make the grill or to change the amount of heat. I would definitely recommend this product for quality and fun!

1, Awesome Book!: This was a great book for any Martha. When she talks about herself in the book you will probably find yourself connecting with her character. I used it to prepare to speak to my Mops group and it was a great resource! I haven't mastered it
0, Only because I can't give a book 0 stars: Only because I can't give a book 0 stars did this one get 1 star.Patrick Robinson
0, Barracuda 945 Goes Off the Deep End Along with the Author: Others have summed up this book rather well: it's beyond pathetic. Take an interesting idea
0, A waste of time: Earlier books like Nimitz class were more entertaining but this one betrays the superficiality of the author's acquaintance with naval officers
0, Buyer Beware: Will Carroll is not a medical expert. He has no formal training in sports medicine.If you do read this book
1, well.......: i love anything WWE/WWF

1, Michelle L.: Great product. Durable and easy to use. Kids love it. Also good for storage of trains/cars.
1, Perfect train and car table!: We ordered this for our son's 2 year birthday. It arrived quicker than anticipated and is perfect for our son. He spends hours each day playing on it
1, Awesome Train Table!!: This is one of the best train tables that I have found especially for younger kids. my son got this for his 2nd birthday and it is by far his favorite toy. The table is very sturdy

1, great pen: Great looking
0, Couldn't read it: Why would anyone write a book on how to read?? i bought it hoping to learn how to read but what they don't tell you is that you have to read to find out
0," Misleading title; average vocal quality: A misleading title; should be subtitled ""Modern Songs of the Civil War."" Average vocal quality and heavy on modern acoustics. Customers looking for traditional authentic music of the US Civil War can ignore this CD. Disappointing...."
1," humorous perspective on life and relationships: I only saw a portion of this movie toward the end of it and only ""caught"" a portion of the title"
0, Dissapointing!: Foremost
0, The Best For Sure!: These guy's are the best I've ever seen. If you can handle the truth
0, Never again
1, not your typical hindi movie ...: I'll keep this short.Its good. Not the best movie ever
0, Not worth the money: Product description led me to believe this to be a great product that would satisfy my needs for a garden spray nozzle. I was very disappointed to find it a cheaply made product that came apart the very first time I attempted to use it. The nozzle leaks and the large spray head falls off every time you run water through it.
1," The Happy Hollister's: I can't say enough about the series of books of the ""Happy Hollister's"". I also grew up reading these books in the 70's and wishing my mother hadn't given the books away. The characters are uplifting and wholesome. I now have children who would benefit from reading these great wholesome story books. (Myself"
1, Good for starters or review.: I bought this on sale with the tapes. I had three years of Latin in high school
0, Where's the tape.: As far as I'm concerned
0, A lengthly rehash of magazine articles on global warming: The book is all politically correct text with little technical data.The author details how the oil and coal companies derailed efforts to reduce fossil fuel use in the U.S. He claims surprisingly low costs for wind and solar power
1, The Real King of the Blues: Albert king had a great impact on many guitar players.from Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughn. this album is but a small sample of the vast array of blues he produced. all in all
0, Not that Great: I'm actually somewhat disappointed because I heard a lot of good stuff about Glen Plake but his videos are just not that entertaining compared to Warren Miller's stuff. The action sequences are just not that exciting. I bought this set because I was not able to get Fistful of Moguls by itself and sure enough
0, Who gave woman a free pass?: I am aficionado of good books on technical analysis and this is certainly not a good one! Many of the techniques described in this book were invented by me as well many years before this book was published. Subseqeuntly
1, diaper bag: bought this bag for my husband. strap is meant to be worn over the shoulder (messenger style). I had hard time with it on shoulder. The wipe portion didn't really keep the wipes moist though. Lots of room. My hubby loves that he has a manly diaper bag! ^_^
1, A rousing romantic melodrama: Someone could make a pretty good movie of this. Tragic bereavement
1, Wilkie Collins amazed me again!: This Wilkie Collins is incredible - I was excited to find it on Amazon for my Kindle. It captured my attention as quickly as The Moonstone and The Woman in White. Wilkie Collins has an amazing quality of making his charaacters
1, view the world through the eyes of a fat cat!: I LOVE this book! I stood in the bookstore and laughed out loud when I read it. I have a huge cat and totally connected with the story. I think it's creative
0, BORING: I bought this based on the great reviews
1, Marvelous! If you're in to rock
1, What are you listening to? That music is Garbage!: All hail Shirley Manson! This CD is awsome. Not many of the songs are fast
1, awesome album: one of the best albums ever
1, The great original version of a fantastic movie: This is without a doubt the best version of the original story. A must buy for lovers of classic movies.
0, Bad stuff: This movie is bad. Well sure its not horrible but considering the amount of movies there are containing the story of Mogley this one is the lowest. Very poor quality and bad acting.
1, Please
0," Not so Perfect: I enjoyed the style of ""Brilliant"" very much. It was original and fun. ""Priceless"" was much more uneven. ButI enjoyed ""Perfect"" even less. Kick has become smug"
1, Kiss at their best: Reading the review before i purchased this product i wasnt certian weather it would be worth the buy
1," An author worth reading: There should be a section in the book stores called intelligent and thoughtful reflection. You can find books like these but they are scattered in the hundreds of awful releases in ""Self Help"""
0, A great find!: This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book.
1, Insightful and encouraging: I love the book because it has helped me to put those dark places that have/will occur in my life in a place that makes sense and enables me to move forward.
0, Book not as described: This is just to alert someone in Amazon that the book that came wasn't the book I ordered. I ordered the Penguin Classics edition
1, Gaskell Rules: It is fun to read the book from which the TV miniseries was taken. Seeing the people in print gives more to their on screen characterizations. I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations.
1, Good old-fashioned English Literature: Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable.
1, Cranford (Penguin Classics): Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell
1," And I thought good guys had all the fun...: After reading this enticing and intriguing book I knew the problems with my plan - I was too nice a guy and needed to start in the basement rather than on the top floor... Taguchis theory really inspired me and the way the authors tied some pretty intense math theories into the dating world was awesome!But dont worry folks! It isnt a math book it is a mans ""MUST HAVE"" book for getting the hotchicks time and time again...Excellent work to the Bob's.Looking forward to the next one!"
1, Fascinating Information: I bought this book to use in the classroom for a lesson Iwas doing in my 12th grade American Government class. It wasgreat for the students! They could really relate to information.I was amazed at how eager my students were to make efforts tohelp our environment. I admire Ms. Hill and all the efforts shehas made in raising awareness!!!
1, What kind of person attacks the openness of a society?: A fine work
1, The historic effects of the prevailing mental operating syst: Up to the introduction of computer software Plato's thinking catastrophe went at large unnoticed culminating in the past centuries' human catastrophes. This book reveals that thread through human history in a mind blowing way. But at the end it becomes obvious that the author in himself is mentally trapped too
1, A seriously important book
1, Eliot's masterwork: It's as sentimental as you would expect
1, Perfect!!: My favorite shoe--I have them in brown and black...and actually this is my 2nd pair of black. I wore out the first pair I had! I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly. I can walk on them for long distances or stand for hours with no pain in my feet. Pretty much all of my other shoes are Softwalk as well
1, Spectre Chrome Breather Cap: This is without question the best version of this cap available on the market. It is far better quality than the more expensive domestic name brand models. It fits down over the fill tube farther
0, weak and boring album: I don't know what the other hyperventilating reviewers are smokin
1, its extreme fun!!!: If you ever tried this
0, Uhhhh.......This game is no fun...!!!: When I first bought the game and played it with all my friends
0, I don' like this game...: This game is really bad. I think that because 1.Very hard 2.the mini-games are really not that good 3.bad graphics 4.gets very boring 5.I don't like the Mario party series 6.The NPC's are either to smart
1, Forget Fusion Frenzy!: Nice try MS. But Fuzion Frenzy is not the great alternitive to Mario Party series. This has better gameplay and mini-games while your game only has better graphics.Nintendo continues to rock
1, A GREAT GAME!: This is a great Game. Compared to the first or second one this one is much better. There are over 70 minigames to play and it includes a story mode and a party mode. This game is great for multiplayer but not good for single player. In the single player mode the comps are either too easy or too hard and since the only human player is you it makes the game dull
0, Bad Moon rising: I purchased this after the death of Rev. Moon in an effort to learn more about him and the Unification Church. I was disappointed in this e-book. There was very little new information. what is in this e-book is what you can find in an online search. I expected a more in-depth study on this topic. If your looking to learn about the Moonies
1, Cover fits: I have bought several of these to replace missing covers on older units in my rental units. The price is very reasonable compared to box store prices. These are not easy to find locally. The fit is perfect.
0, WTF?: So
0, Poor Packaging: Haven't used the product yet - beach vacation starts next week. Only received 2/3 of a bottle due to poor packaging. The bottle was loose in the bottom of the box and leaked all over.
0, Excellent Sunscreen
0, PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE: I forced myself to watch the entire first episode to see if it would get any better
1, I never forgot this!: This miniseries has stayed in my mind since I saw it about 20 years or so ago. I love every second of it. The scenery is gorgeous
1, Flambards DVD: I also saw this on PBS may years ago and loved it then. Found I still do. It's the kind of programming that doesn't happen anymore and most likely never will. Probably beacause of the expense and the extraordinary time length. It is long. The person watching would have to be as religious about carving out time to view it as I was. But I don't mind the lenght because I think it helps make it true to the book. And that's important to me. I have never seen a remake of this. So
1, DVD: In March I posted a message entitled DVD please. To my amazement
1," Songs from the Night Before: I was intially motivated to purchase this David Sanborn classic due to the Detroit area local jazz station regular play of Sanborn's cd ""Songs from the night before"" song ""Rikky"". That is a very relaxing"
0, Outdated and misleading: I have to warn all readers of this book that its methodology is either outdated or just simply not working. As a regular investor
1, Make the trend your friend - Zwiegs system works: Very simply this system is all about following the trend and followin interest rates.In 2000
0, Vocal Gems from OKLAHOMA!: The 1947 London cast of OKLAHOMA! recorded only highlights from the score arranged in 3-song medleys and spread over 4 78 RPM sides. You get sense of the story (wth the songs all out of order) and the performances - even the great Howard Keel - do not come across well due to the age of the masters. A curio for collectors who want every version of the score and possibly for Keel fans. Otherwise stick with the more complete albums. (WARNING: Total playing time for these OKLAHOMA! selections is about 16 minutes. Even with the bonus tracks this is a very short CD!)
0, garbage: Just like 90% of the other reviewers
0, I guess I should feel lucky: After reading everyone else's reviews I feel lucky that I was able to use mine for 2 1/2 years before the audio stopped working. That will be my last Toshiba product.
0, Fundamental flaw (so does price really matter?): I bought this unit and was very happy with it for the first two months - good picture
0, Gift from our daughter: My wife and I gecieved the toshiba SD-1700 as a gift from our daughter. She was so excited
0, not what i asked for: i went to a site looking for a portable dvd player w/screen and i found one at a fantastic price so i paid for it . when i lokked at data for it a home dvd player came up and now i am having trouble getting ahold of the person who sold it to my via amazon.com....pretty bogus if you ask me. this is the first time i have bought something over the web..maybe i am stupid but i did everything that amazon told me to do.it was an initial portable dvd player w/screen model sd 1700. toshiba sd1700 home dvd player was sent to me.
1, Tough reading: Although Frank's writing is readable
1, 4 1/2 year old LOVES this thing!: Despite all the bad reviews
0, Frizzy hair: We were very happy to get this toy until our daughter played with it and the frizzy hair is horrible. The hair comes out and is very unmanagable; you can't even get the comb thru it. I would not recommend this toy to anyone.
1, Comprehensive
1, Dare To Dream and Work To Win: Excellent book for developing the right mind-set for network marketing! It's a must have for your library!
1, Very Motivational---Ultra Practical!: This book really breaks down the seemingly impossible goals into every day tangible and reasonable thought processes. The author takes the overwhelming and turns it into a learning opportunity to help raise you up when you have the aaaaaa-HA! moment going in your mind.
0, FEMA Manual written as a novel: You know when an author has exhausted his genre when the entire naval climax takes less than a page and a half
1, Geopolitical Detail
0, Umm Excuse Me...: Are HAMAS that Stupid not to pospone their target date orginally set for October 9th. Just coz the GPS system was not working for them to luanch the missle from long range would not have put HAMAS in a panic situation to fire from close to shore where they were eventually ..... If I were HAMAS I wouldA) wait till the GPS were back on line and fire missle from long range.B) Not set a target date and have all the US NAVY and Patriot missles ready to obliterate me out of the water
0, Stick to Subs
0, I found this book boring.: It started out pretty interesting
1," whole hog: This DVD is very good. It's OCMS at their prime. The harmonies and instrumentals are right on pitch. You know how some live performances are ""not as good"" as the studio versions. These tunes are ""just as good"". And the cinematography especially at The Orange Peel is terrific. I'd go whole hog ~ five stars."
1, Most Recent Screenshots look Impressive: Don't be fooled by the screenshots here on Amazon. They were posted almost a year ago. I saw some recent screenshots of the game on a gaming portal and the screens look beautiful! A lot of added particle effects and added detail to the game. I'm excited to get my copy. Lucasarts did a great job with Starfighter so I'm sure Super Bombad will be equally impressive.
1, Excellent: Absolutely worth reading. Both as the officer or the spouse. I've read it and the future spouse is going to be reading it next. Lots or great tips and knowledge on how the job is.
0, Dishonest/misleading: It is VERY dishonest to present the DVD is such a way as to allow the buyer to think they are getting two Shirley Temple classics. Why would anyone package these two movies together other than to mislead the buyer. The picture on the DVD cover shown on Amazon is not what I received.This item should be pulled from Amazon.
1, Two Great Family Films: This is the absolute best print of The Little Princess staring Shirley Temple. The print of Heidi is also superb. The Heidi stars Maximilian Schell and Jene Simmons. Both films are superb family entertainment. A bargain of two films for the price of one and a well done effort by Marengo Films.
1, AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!!: I've been reading JLA graphic novel for a number of years
1, A couple of glaring inconsistencies: First
1, Value for money: Good value for money. I plugged into my new XP machine
0, two of mine died. This product stinks.: I bought my first rio about a month ago
0, Major Disappointment: I have had a poor experience with this product. I have gone through two units
1, Great display
0, PLEASE Read This and Beware: I have had my Rio 800(128) for approximately 50 days now and have used it everyday.I followed the directions for calibrating the battery and I have had excellent results with the battery life meeting and sometimes exceeding the 10 hour advertised performance for the first 30 days. Yet recently my player developed a BATTERY LIFE problem and now I get approximately 1.5 hours of music before my player needs to be recharged. I have tryed to recalibrated but still I get the same results.After reading other comments about similar problems posted here I beleive this problem runs much deeper than that of a slip in quality assurance department or a faulty battery.If this player performed as advertised it would far exceed any other player in its market place
0, Weak: In short
0, They should fix this thing: I bought a Rio 800/128 on Wednesday
0, This product and company are horrible: I bought this player and worked for about 3 months. Then it just stopped playing the audio all together. I sent it back to SONICblue to get it fixed and instead of sending the player back to me
1, Bargain Player...better than you think: The Rio 800 has had some poor press
0, Not up to par.: A little too pop oriented for me.Not the progressive rock I like in their earlier stuff.Photo's of Ghost
0, a bit watered-down: I am a huge fan of Edelman
0, Poor example of literature .....surely didn't hold up to the change of the times.: BORING!! Doesn't hold up to the times... Read this for a book club. Would not have finished it if it wasn't for my bookclub!!
0, Not too good: Maybe I missed something
0, Corrupted: The Kindle version is full of incorrect words
1, Great book even with a few typos: Maybe I'm just not as unforgiving as the other reviewers
1, Interesting: The story shocked the turn-of-the century folks because of the sensitive themes it.tackled. But in today's context
0, Did not reach its potential: This series has developed the history previous to Frank Herbert's Dune. I like what it attemps
0, Disappointing: Read and liked Frank Herbert's Dune books. This is only the second Dune book by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson that I've read
1, An fascinating book.: This is my favorite Le Guin book. As much a political science book as science fiction.Also one one of the feew utopias written after WW2. The title refers to an anarchist society that lives on the moon who do not have possesion. Far from one sided this book shows the problems of both societies through the eyes of Shevek
1, One of Le Guin's best: Despite being less well-known than her Earthsea books or The Left Hand of Darkness
0, Big Disappointment! :(: I already own the Swivel Sweeper

0, the worst toy ever that has been made on earth!!!!: this is the worst toy i have ever seen the hair is really bad because when i took it out of the box the hair was all notty. what a waist of money and it was also a huge rip off!!!!!!
0, Falls Apart: This toy has barely been played with and her arm has fallen off! It can't even be fixed!
0, Get ready for matted hair: I bought this item for my 4yr old. It sounded great-Hair will really curl
1, Excellent CD: I just received this CD and loved it
0, Unreliable and unsafe: While this dryer did dry my hair sufficiently
1, why???: Why did they ever stop making these? The tabs are effective and even taste good. I miss them very much.
1, wish we could find these in stores: These are great. I don't use them often but they are the ONLY Tums I have ever been able to handle the taste of. The chocolate flavor IS a fake taste but it's not sickening and doesn't have an aftertaste. These get the job done for those with mild heartburn. I just wish I could find them in stores
0, Don't even waste your time with this one.....: I got this remote and at first i was very happy with it. Although it feels very light and cheap like another reviewer had stated
0, Don't buy this!!!: This is absolute crap!I bought this and some buttons wouldn't work at all
0, LAME: Piece of junk. Kind if worked for a little while
0, Lucked out: Owning a Rowenta that faied within the first year I went the nearest Target and asked for the black Rowenta 6900 man's iron
1," ""Shawn Michaels: From The Vault"" Review: The greatest matches of WWF superstar Shawn Michaels are showcased in this two-disc DVD. All of the matches are shown in their entirety with video introductions by Michaels himself. Among them are a tag team match from his early AWA days"
0, Don't Waste Your Money: What a disappointment! This book doesn't provide any real recipes for juices. The information it has about certain vegetable juices or benefits can be found for free on the internet or in most juicing books that have far greater value than this. This is outdated and mostly useless.
1, Fresh
0, Don't Do It!: I bought this product for my GF. She has violent reactions to gluten. She took the product as per intructions and we had pizza. At first it appeared successful
1, An end to a wonderful set: I have collected all 15 sets of this serier
0, reruns: I really love the series but this set had shows from earlier set in it and I already had them so I already watched them. I was very disappointed. Set 15 was actually a waste of time and money. I was happy with set 14.
1, Barnaby at his best.: My husband and I enjoy watching the Midsome series. We have almost all the Sets. Hardest part is not watching the whole set at one sitting.!
0, This is horrible: A classic book
1, Classic: This story -- as with most Dr. Seuss books -- is great. Kids and adults can enjoy The Cat in the Hat!
1, Pretty Good
1, Fun Film: I almost didn't rent this movie because of the cover. I figured it was going to be another splatter movie
0, Not for TiVo: The site did not state the version of the software. TiVo can only use version 2.6 or 2.8 and some 3.0. This is version 4.1 and will not work on TiVo. I wish the site had listed what version it was before I ordered.
1, WOW: If only the rest of the software/hardware industry adobting this easy installation and useability. I bought two of these to work with my wireless router and was up in no time. Now with WinVNC installed I'm able to exchange files between both computers and surf the net at blazing speeds.
0, It is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XP -NO CUSTOMER SERVICE: If you know the workings of computers intimately
0, Works fine but not the WEP under XP: It took me 5 minutes to set up the unit on my XP Pro machine. Everything worked fine if WEP was not considered. However

0, BEWARE -- v4 not compatible with TIVO!: Amazon is now shipping WUSB11 v4
0, Unresolved problems with Win98: This unit is so good in so many ways
0, I can't get it to work to save my life...: I would have giving it no stars if all possible. I spent my money with the hopes that it would make my life easier
1, Installing WUSB11 on XP: Once installed
0, Doesn't work: Bought it for my son's computer (home for the winter break from college)
0, Not reliable: I purchased a WAP and 2 usb adapters a year ago. It worked fine for windows 98 but on windows xp it has given me nothing but trouble. I updated the drivers and firmware on the wusb11 and have been rewarded with a non-reliable connection. I am waiting for the price to drop on 802.11a cards and wap to replace these...
1, WUSB11 rating: Great item. Easy to set up with Linksys support. They were so helpful. I only wish that all products were as supportive.
1, Simple installation! No problem: I just installed Linksys USB adapter after my D-Link DWL-120 died after 1 yr of use. It took me less than 5 minutes to set it up. It works great! After my experience with D-Link products and technical supports
1, Linksys WUSB11 Wireless-B USB Network Adapter: This unit has worked flawlessly since we set it up. It was easy to install since it is external. It is also easy to move to another computer
1, Great wireless adapter - Fast surfing: Very easy to setup
0, Did Not Work: I was attempting to set up a desktop comptuer running Windows XP in a room separate from my office. I originally bought the Linksys PCI adapter and it never installed properly. After 6 hours on the phone with text support and 2 PCI units
0, Back in the package it goes!: Would definately NOT recommend this product! The clip accessory would not go on. Very awkward fit.
0, Not a white bladed ceiling fan: The ceiling fan came super fast but the blades were not white like I thought they would be. Instead they are a very ivory/ cream color
1, Great for the money!: Great dresser for the money
1, inspiring: I like Saul's sense of humor and practical approach. Since reading this book
1," well done!: a nice collection of songs... it gave me some artist names to type into pandora.com I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase. It's a slow Sunday morning with a cup of coffee on the couch album. I've listened to the album through a pair of Headroom amped 701 AKGs and it is well mastered - the instruments are well placed and it has good depth. ""Pale Moon"" always hooks me and the slide guitar on ""Don't Look For Me"" is simply smooth. And"
1, nice system: im not ready for vista
0, Poor Quality Player and Bad Customer Support: I purchased the player as a gift needless to say after about a month of use the machine stopped working. MP3's would play for a short while and just freeze the machine. The switch would not power down the machine and I would have to remove the batteries in order to reset it.I have had nothing but several weeks of emails with customer support and have finally received a replacement. Only trouble is this replacement does not work at all. It does not even switch on.For those of you who may doubt the bad reviews here
0, looks like 5 stars

1, a great book: I found this novel to be a Hemingway classic
0, Two stars is being nice: I read this book in eighth grade. It's been a couple years since then
0, A Farewell to Arms: This has got to be one of the WORST books I've ever read. A number of us in our book club wondered how this book is considered a classic. The writing is terrible (For example the dialogue is not clear when the characters are having a conversation - you lose track of who's saying what. Also
0," Why is this a classic?: I enjoy ""the classics"" and have read most of Hemingways works. This isn't up to par of the others and I would skip it. I had to force myself to read it."
0," Terrible ""best of"" for a really funny person.: I really don't like this ""best of"" because I can't stand that they included clips and montages instead of the entire skit at times. The skits that Farley was in were absolutely hilarious"
1, A gift: This was a gift for my son in law. We laughed till we cried on Christmas eve. Predictable and unexpected all at once the family spent the next day quoting lines from the various skits.A note the shipping was more than the cost of the DVD and seemed high for a small bubble wrap envelope. But it arrived in time as promised.
0, DeWalt inferior to Makita; MaxTool DoubleBilled me!: I have had many cordless Makita drills for probably almost 15 years

0, Beware of ToolKing: If you expect to buy these new in the package
1, Dewalt 18 volt tools: I have used Dewalt 18 volt tools for several years and a 24 volt saw for the last 3 years. Out of 5 18 volt batteries only one died after 2 years of use and it was used when I got it. The 24 volt saw has only one battery and it works as good as the day I bought it. These tools are used almost daily and I dont do a good job of taking care of them.
1, Dewalt DC 9060-2 18 volt: I used often battery tools and I need good battery
1, Dewalt batteries: I used the batteries for my Dewalt sawsall and my Dewalt drill. After a chargeto make sure they were fully charged I used them in contructiong an addition tomy deck. They both worked great and as I only had one before it was a welcomerelief not to be switching batteries all the time. Now I have three and lifeis much simpler.
1, batteries: I buy a set of these batteries every couple of months
1, It's about Bat-time!!!: WELL... nearly 40 years later! It's about Bat- time that Adam West and Burt Ward's 'Batman' movie is finally brought to DVD! This 1966 movie is a great transfer and a fun movie- A welcome addition to any Bat-Fans' DVD collection... BUT... it still can't hold a candle to the Original TV series! Hey
0, Batman - The Movie Review: But this for my kids and it was the most boring movie I have ever watched.The shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie.
0, Bad memories from the past.: The Batman TV series are actually awful. It simply does not fit to Batman such campiness. If it was Spider-Man
0, I'd forgotten how bad it is: Like many things from childhood
0, campy spoof for people who hate comics: Here's a list of everything Batman related that is better than this:** everything except the Batman and Robin movie with George Clooney (tie)

1, Beautifully documented and narrated video.: When I saw this documentary on TV in South Africa
1," HOT TUNA;""Burgers"": I first heard this LP in '72 at college"
1, Funny movie: This movie is really funny. The actors did a great job. A lot of scenes in this movie are really funny. Good date movie.
0, Trash: I can't believe anybody likes this garbage. What a ridiculous idea. Remember when cartoons used to teach children pertinent lessons and morals? Too bad that was lost to cheap animation and crudeness.
0," Oh Tartar Sauce!: Where is Help Wanted? How can this be the ""complete"" first season without this episode? The Spongebob fan in our house is really disappointed."
1, Fun for the Whole Family: I love SpongeBob Squarepants
0, Never received video.: I recently was charged for this video which I purchased from amazon.com because Netflix doesn't have the Spongebob pilot
1, What gives?: Has anyone noticed besides me that 1 episode is missing from the set? At least on my DVDs
1, waiting for book 3: Well written Christian fantasy with great battle scenes and an an insight to how a portion of biblical history may have looked
1, Neuger Advances Beyond Feminism: It has been about twenty years since I have journeyed into pastoral counseling approaches to the care of women. Neuger teaches me a lesson about keeping up to date in the literature. She treats the pastoral counseling of women in much broader contexts than the early feminist literature did. I felt invited to journey with her.
1, Best bang for the dollar...: This was purchased to be used in my truck as a back massager lol. Well worth the money and will fit in several places requiring no special installation.
0, Disappointed!: This item was a disappointment because it was much smaller and lighter than I expected. For the price I expected a more substantial chain and pendant....had it been priced appropriately
1, Midsomer Murders: I really enjoy Midsomer Murders. I own all 16 sets and this newest one is as good as the first. These shows are fun solving the mysteries and the characters are great.
1, GP100 sight --- improves front sight picture: I would definitely recommend this over the stock sight that comes with the gun.The sight installs easily and tight into the gun. Definitely improves seeing the front sight picture
1, Ruger GP-100 front sight: The Hi-Viz sight is a terrific
1, Great sight: Got the sight in yesterday
1, Pretty cool
0, Black ink cartridges for Epson printer: These cartridges were advertised to work on Epson Stylus CX5400
0, Missing a solid basis of appreciation for truth: I really WANTED to like this book. Being aware of the sacramental nature of our life in Christ is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about. Unfortunately
1, Fantastic: His Writing are the real thing! The characters are written so realisitc and not too super-human..... Mulford's stories of Hopalong make you feel like your reading about a real person form the past....
0, Ok but a bit slow: Several assorted stories of the West with characters pretty well developed
0, Book: I like westerns but this was so childish in the way conversation was depicted that I couldn't get oast the 2nd page.
1, Music to my eyes!: A visually stunning book for music lovers or casual fans. The multimedia format really takes the music and lyrics to a new level. Cheers to Graham for this wonderful effort!
1, I like this book!: I guess I must fall into the constant stream of spammers who like this book. (What's your problem Mr. Frankfurter?) I got this book for my birthday recently and find it fascinating. Not much else to add other than kudos to Graham Nash for this engaging effort.
0, I AM non Shadyac movie: I also got fooled by the title thinking it was the new movie by director Tom Shadyac. I bought both a used and new copy
0, Not worth the money: I didn't even give this movie 1 star but had to in order to post this. This was the most money I've spent on a DVD through Amazon.com and I was extremely disappointed. I suffered through the whole movie
0, Not as expected: This movie comes up when you search for Tom Shadyac's new film of the same title. They did accept my return
1, Great Movie!: I thought this was another great movie. Katherine heigl was great
0, Far from five stars: I bought this movie based on all the glowing five-star reviews (and based on the fact that I am desperate for more great period pieces). Well
1, Best version of him: Mas Amedda was always one of the more interesting aliens in the prequels. This figure gets pretty high marks. The only thing I would like to see in a future update is a soft goods outer cloak. The hard plastic works well enough but limits articulation. Also
0, Not What I Expected: First lemme say that I was a huge 112 fan
1, briefcase: I was impress with the quality. I was skeptical ordering this on line without looking at it in person. I didn't look cheat. I am happy with the product.
0, could have been better
0, Snipe snipe snipe
1, A nice collection: This is a collection of speaches from some of our lesser founding fathers. It includes speaches by John Quincy Adams
0, music or sound?: Well
0, Mind Numbing: While a potentially interesting topic
1, cane that will not fall down: The cane arrived in pristine condition. It was fully assembled. All that was necessary was to open the box. This cane is adjustable. It is not necessary to stoop down to hold onto the cane.
1, Nice little tuner: Very unique. I like how it picks up on vibrations. My biggest complaint is that the arrow system used is rather confusing at first and it is difficult to tell how accurate it actually is. Other than that
0, boo!: this game just is'nt the same. it gets very boring SOON
0, Three DVDs Blank: As others stated
1, Good looks
1, Isaac Hayes lLive......WOW!: He sounds good live as well as in the studio. one thing...i wish he did more of his material.overall
0, Buy a Logitech: This mouse is nice and comfortable
0, rusted: The construction of the roast pan is ridiculous. Picture folding paper into a roast pan
0, MD in NC mtns: That review of product's not accurate. I don't know. Didn't use them. They looked really good in the package. Bought them with the Panasonic Flash Xpress Toaster Oven and they don't fit so I had to return them.
0, Buyer beware! This is the worst.: There is nothing good about this movie except for the title. Bad acting excuse me
1, Good.: Unique
0, War of the Gay - closet sci-fi at its cheapest!: This film is camper than a Freddie Mercury video! Even the leading man goes for a retro Victorian clone look
0, Like gay porn with all the sex taken out: This really looks like Tim Hines decided to make a gay porno version of H.G. Wells book but at the last minute took all the sex out in the mistaken belief he'd made a proper movie. It bears a passing resemblance to the novel
0," ""Beware! Take care..."": Had Timothy Hines and Susan Goforth put as much creative energy into this movie as they have with the numerous bogus reviews they've allegedly planted here and at the IMDB"
1, APPLAUSE FOR THIS PRODUCTION.: I applaud this movie. I can't imagine what it must have been like for these guys to be making this movie and then Spielberg and Tom Cruise decied to make it also. Points for them getting it done and points for the movie's success. Spielberg's movie is updated. This one is set in late 1800's true to the book. The War of the Worlds is at last on the screen.
1, Bizarrely entertaining.: -Bizarrely entertaining
1, The most true
0, Cheap dumb ripoff: Even if there wasn't a big budget Spielberg Cruise film coming out
0, The biggist pile of crud i have ever seen!!!!: Right 
0, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!: This movie was truly a piece of crap. My wife picked it up at Sam's Club for about eight bucks
0, Please stop-motion FX Harryhausen
1, A solid adaptation of H. G. Wells'es book.: We liked this movie very much. A great adaptation of the novel. Very accurate. Very entertaining.
0, don't believe the 5-star reviews: Seriously
0, The War of the Worlds: Very bad movie.....the actors...the script ....very poor...I am disappointed. If I can I will return de movie.Tessie Martinez
0," Perhaps a good bad movie!: ""For the first time ever"
0, Not what I expected: This is not the movie that I thought it was. The one that I was looking for was the one with Gene Barry in it. You can tell that this movie is not up to par.
0, Cynical
0, If you believe the great reviews here
0, Not even exorcism could save this film: In the old days the only way you could buy films was on Super 8mm. They would be cut down to 10 or 20 minutes
0, Ick!: How this film got released is a mystery. I mean
1, I loved it.: The special effects
1, I liked this story.: I liked this story. It was worth the money I spent. It is a good scence fiction movie and I am placing it in my collection of DVD's.
0, Where is the original War of the Worlds?????: I know about the 1975 movie (The day that panicked America) made of the 1938 radio broadcast for war of the worlds.I know about the 1953 fiction movie made from Orson Welles book..And I know about the audio cd's from the radio broadcast.But I am not looking for either of those..When I was a kid
0, great script
0, The fake War of the Worlds: Cheap no-quality knock-off of Spielberg's film with bad actors shot on low quality video tape. Goes on forever. Save your money and buy the book.
1, My Favorite So Far.: The Pyramids Of Mars is my favorite Doctor Who episode. This is my favorite Wells adaptation to date. A freakish
0, Good Concept But Not Worth It: First of all
1, Great for toes: They work great for saving your toes while wearing pointe shoes.Use them regularly and think they work very well.
0, poorly written
0, Not a Good Book...: My biggest pet peeve in a book is repetition to make a book into a book rather than a pamphlet. Too much repetition and not engaging enough in it's repetition to be considered worthwhile. If you are a true beginner and want to just start meditating
1, Best book on meditation I've ever read: This is flat-out the best book on meditation I have ever read. Whether you are a complete novice thinking about starting to meditate
1, Looking good so far: I havent finished the book yet but I feel if I practice the teachings of meditation as offered by the author it will lead to a much more aware and focused life. I really enjoy the way Joseph Goldstein writes and how honest he is about what to expect. So far I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
1, Fantastic!: This is an incredible bbook. It is extremely imaginative and very thorough. My 8 year old is hooked on it and wants to bbuy more of his books. Chris Hart makes it very easy to draw Japanese comic characters.
1, A tech-house album including Kevin's signature techniques.: I purchased this cd after seeing Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May do a 4 turntable tag team in Oakland. Before hand
0," Deceptive description - quantity is 100 softgels not 300: The headline says: ""Carlson Laboratories - A & D"
0, Star Wreck was a Train Wreck: This movie really is a wreck.It's not in English
0, The Emperor's New Clothes: I look at all the five star reviews of this book and just shake my head. Much of this slim
0, Large and slow are a bad combination.: I bought this TV and returned it a week later
1, Out of this world: I have enjoyed the Midsommers murders since they have been on t.v. I really like the dectives
1, time well spent: These mysteries are quite well written and well acted. The stories are involving and thought-provoking. I have the entire set and have watched several episodes many times. Each time I find something else to interest me. In addition
1, Try to Figure Them Out!: Try to figure out these wonderful mysteries that have at least two or more bodies laying about! The surrounding English countryside is reason enough to watch the series
0, not what i expected: This book was not helpful. I was expecting insightful information
0, Don't expect to get anywhere with this one...: I ordered this atlas and then sent it back. The maps have no detail whatsoever
1, A Must-Have: This album is a must have for true fans of 70's R&B music. Very tight
1, A must-have for true souls: 24-carat Black is one of the best soulgroups from the days of wayback. As heard in many of today's HipHop-tracks you'll find the most important tracks on this CD. Hail these deep grooves !!!! Buy in the name of good music. This CD is it !!!
0, feminist jewish propaganda - dont waste your money!: full of psychobabble and whining
1, thechnical perfection not always works: I own gardiner versions and some herewege they play wonderfully and perfect in the sense of cleaness and articulations but harnoncourt versions of these cantatas have a sense of being in the church itself
1, Perfect for my slight repair: I received a hammered dulcimer as a gift. It had 2 missing plastic inserts to hold up the sire strings. This plastic tube fit the bill just right.
0, Mouse Pointer moves erratically. I gave up on it.: I purchased this mouse. I installed it and noticed the mouse pointer would move suddenly all around the screen. I looked the problem up at the Microsoft sight and they gave me a page of about 35 registry changes which I had to make to try to correct. The changes had to be made after you un-installed the driver
0, Uhh: Well the reviews were accurate
0, Too short for anything practical.: This is a total rip off and amazon has the nerve to charge me for return shipping. The cord must be plugged into a wall outlet
1, Richard Simmons Slimmons Binder is Excellent: Excellent
1, ny review of this excellent book: very useful
1, Unforgetable book.: I read this book in High School (late 80's) on a recomendation of a friend and I just loved it. Recently I found a copy at a coffee shop for $1 and just had to buy it and read it again. Again it is a very gripping book about the vietnam war and a ranger team. This is a must for any fan of military stories and veterans.
1, good battery: Ordered this battery to replace my old ones. Because I have an older type cordless drill it was very hard finding the right replacement for it. The battery I purchased does work and is the right voltage but does not fit just perfect. It clicks on to my drill and sometimes has to be pulled off with some pressure to release. Overall the battery was what I expected and have no problems charging or holding a charge. Good battery.
1, There are sequels!: Great book. (Four stars is a lot from me.) I see a lot of people looking for a sequel
0, Not Keystone! Not RJ-11!: This insert is too wide to fit into a Keystone plate; it is more properly called a QuickPort insert. Also
1, The Neurobioloby of Addiction: I am a clinical psychologist and a chemical dependency specialist. I have been looking for a book that could be a reference for my masters and doctoral students on what different drugs or alcohol do to the brain and why they are so addictive. There are many good texts out on the market but they are all very technical. This book
0, This dvd is a scam!: This dvd only lasts 30 minutes! It's boring! Talk about Britney Spears and The Beatles
0, waste of money: This pan is awful you get what you pay for. Cheaply made even when you spray pan egg sticks when you fold pan parts of the egg falls out. Would not recommend it to anyone.
0, Piece of junk: This pan went into the garbage after the first use. I bought this to replace an older model that scratched after years of use. We made one omelette which stuck terribly to the pan. Once we got it out of the pan
1, Scott Hampton at his best: If you're a fan of Scott Hampton's artwork as I am
1, Excellent insight: This book gave me an excellent insight into one of the important aspects of yacht racing: your own psyche. Why do the same people tend to win over and over again
1, Microsoft LifeCam NX-6000 Webcam: Great value! This item works very well with my laptop - I talk with and see my son who is in Afghanistan. I can speak in a normal voice and he has no problem hearing me. The mic is great and so is the video!
0, THE VIDEO is not working for Skype for my Windows....: I don't know why but this is not working fully with my Skype on my windows computer.I have a mac too but when I try just to use the Camera (Because MacBook already got microphone inside)it shut off the Skype in 5 seconds...So I am not really recommending this product.But the Logistic one! They do greater job!
0, Nx-6000 WebCam from Microsoft*: I found some minor issues with this WebCam:(1) I cound not mount it to the top screen cover of my laptop (an IBM T series) (2) The video quality is poor using an older USB 1.1 port. Conclusion: Microsoft expects you to use a 2.0 port with this WebCam. No biggie!
0, not worth the money: I disagree strongly with the reviews before. My daughter owns a MS Livecam 3000 for much less in price and it beats this one by far. The picture is very smooth yes
1, Outstanding: The webcam is an easy to operate
0, Poor image quality: I bough this webcam for my ID badge bussiness and the quality of the images I get is veeery poor.
0, a picture is better than a thousand words????: I purchased this webcam thinking microsoft would offer a quality product. My first one had a picture but everyone on Skype complained of a loud
0, Do not buy this edition: This edition appears to be from an OCRed text that was not proof-read. Odd spacings
0, WHATCHA GONNA DO: Well
0, a huge let down: i enjoyed the first bad boys movie but when i saw bad boys 2 the movie was horrible the story plot sucked and for two hours all their was were pointless voilence the reason why i did not give this movie one star is because the highway seen was great sadly that was the only thing
0, ABSOLUTE GARBAGE CRAP!!!: This movie is even worse than the original.How could anyone believe that these two comedians are cops?Give me a break.The movie had the same old stereotypical druglord plot to it which is getting very old.The acting was horrible and had some really corny jokes.Will smith stinks as an actor and should stick with being on tv.Way too much mindless rap in the soundtrack.Worst movie of the year.DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB MOVIE!!!
0, Rubbish: This movie is crass and vulgar. Only watched half of it. Pick it up in the discount bin in a few months
1, BRILLIANT: Though the first few chapters took some time..the rest of the book was really AMAZING. I have read a lot of books by the same author but have found this one to be one of his best.While reading the book
0, scarcrow slayer: Scarecrow Slayer is an abomination of a movie. This concerning (Mary) chasing whole movies by the scarecrow. Acting
0, Little Truth
1, Borodina is a Goddess!: While I agree with the previous reviewer about his concerns about this recording I do not agree with his star rating. Olga Borodina and Valery Gergiev make this recording. They are marvelous (as is the Maestro's orchestra and chorus). I simply could not let the Borodina/Gergiev/Kirov/Phillips recording stay at three stars. Thanks
0, Why I hated the The Story of my Life.: Wow.This book is beyond horrible. Many people loved this book because it is a great feat for HELEN KELLER. If any other person wrote this I think many people would hate it. Don't be mad at me because I am comparing her book to other authors and treating her like a normal person which I am sure she would want to be treated like. And she always acted like she could see. When she got a horse she was comparing the horse to a horse in a book mean while I am thinking
1, The next step in learning the game
0, Okay - but very pricey for what I got: The mirror is excellent - almost too much magnification - but the apparatus that extends and holds the mirror is stiff
0, Not at all what I was expecting!: I have watched the first series that came out on television. The first Christy was amazing to watch and share in the lives with the characters on screen or in the book. But after they found a new Christy to play the part in the continuing stories on dvd it all went down hill. It does not have a clear picture and the people that play in it are not relaxed or do well in their parts.
1, Staple Singers-City in the Sky: I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it was released and has been a top album for me. The CD version is just outstanding with 2 added songs that I love also.
1, TAYLOR`S BEST AFTER A PLACE IN THE SUN: Elizabeth Taylor has been quoted saying that this is the film that made her want 2 be more than a mere moviestar. It was the first time since Angela Vickers in A Place in the Sun
0, Premise is Old and Tired: I did not find the premise for this movie to hold up. Van Johson is a frustrated writer with a drinking problem. Elizabeth Taylor is tolerable like most WWII Wives
0, ONE OF THE WORSE ROAN GROUP RELEASES!: The Roan Group usually represents an exceptional product that one will buy on name alone
0, Buyer Beware: It's no fault of Amazon but please beware before purchasing this title. This was a good movie and it's a shame no one has restored it yet. I really expected it to be much better. It looks like it was taken from an old 16MM print and just copied; too many times. It's very grainy and the sound is substandard. Maybe someday someone will do a good job of it.
1, Probably my favorite season of The Office: Somehow my husband and I watched this entire episode in three nights. It's hilarious
0, wish it was a CD...: Lots was written and I will keep mine short:Good: Superb cast [stronger on the male side] with many of them at their pick. Good singing.Not good: all the rest!Visually disturbing production: Incredibly busy set [looks like Arizona not Egypt
0, HOW COULD I HAVE BELIEVED THESE 5 STAR REVIEWS?: This moronic program
0," GREAT FAMILY VALUES SERIES?? NO SIR!!: When I think of family values TV I think of ""The Waltons"" or ""Little House"". Reba is a program that obviously appeals to the masses of people who have no values and no standards by which to abide. If television has become a wasteland it is because of shows like this"
0, STUPID SHOW WITH EGOMANIAC REBA AT THE HELM: There was only one redhead comedienne who could stop the show....Lucille Ball. Reba needs to stop thinking she can top her. Never in my life have I seen anyone who can overact so much!! She doesn't want anyone to top her. But that is typical
0, Show should have been cancelled right there and now.....: First season of this piece of trash was just one follow up of unfunny jokes after another. In one episode
0, Well...: Reba is one of my moms all time favoret shows so i found the first season on line of course im going to buy it for her. but when i got it
0, DON'T THROW IT IN MY FACE!!: For some incoherent reason I bought this DVD set thinking I would see Reba McEntire in a comedy portraying a decent
0, IF YOU FIND DYSFUNCTIONALISM ENDORSED AND APPLAUDED...: Then this is the program for you. If you want a program that promotes healthy family values then forget this mess
1, Why didn't anyone tell me before this?: I'm over 40
1, a priceless collection of songs from a unheralded band: I've recently ordered O&O by The Zombies on CD
1, Masterpiece!: If i asked you to name masterpiece albums from the 60's you'd probably come up with a handful...'Sgt Pepper'...'Days of Future Passed'... 'Pet Sounds' and so on! 'Odessey' without a doubt is right there - unfortunately whether it be bad timing; not enough backing and the production being somewhat lacking
1, Finally!: If you are a military buff with a particular interest in US Naval Special Warfare
1, Navy Seals (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray: Lots of action thats has on this movie Navy Seals (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-rayVery good! Good movie of charlee sheen!
0, An insult to the real Navy Seals: With its comic book plot and cardboard characters this movie does an injustice to the men it takes as its inspiration. Any real world Seal acting as irresponsibly as the Sheen character would not long survive the wrath of his teammates. Yes
1, The answer to a mystery: what did the Church do and why?: Ever wondered why the Catholic Church behaves the way it does? This History is a well written
0, Good for the hard of hearing.: I have had these for years. I put one next to me at my hearing level. Thus my husband can listen to TV more quietly. For me it is mostly for TV
0, Expect it to break: Ive had two of these speaker sets. The power supply failed on the first set. I bought a second set because I could not get a replacement power supply. This set has failed for the same reason. The power supply quite on this set also. Nice system while it works.
0, Guild wars game: i was not to happy with this i got installed it and it ask for a serial code with did not come with it i was so mad. i wrote the people who made the game to give the serial code but they didn't they were pissing me off by sending me stupid e-mails like we need more informing and gave them all i had. so do u this is is good?
0, Derivative
0, Just a correction ...: Just wanted to correct some false information regarding this. As I am (or was) a comic book nerd
0, FAUST love of the bad production.: I have been a fan of the comic book for a long long time. Met Tim Vigil in NYC at a show and he was talking up this movie
1," I watched it last night and I loved it.: I read the book ""The Outsider"" by Penelope Williamson about a year ago. I loved it"
1, Fantastic Western Romance: You won't be disappointed purchasing the movie
1, Get It: This is a genuinely original and brilliant book. Though its foreground subject is heroin
1, CLASS ACT!: At the hotel when the video was aired
1, Rough Stone Rolling: What a wonderful way to get to know the prophet
0, Leaves out important issues in order to protect Smith's reputation.: This biography is not much more than a well-written hagiography which does its best to present Joseph Smith in an imperfect but good-looking light trying to protect his reputation. It ignores significant events that would be of interest to readers. He leaves the Kinderhook Plates out of his chronology
0, Left me wanting answers.: This book did not answer the questions I have about the criminal convictions against Joseph Smith that occurred before the Book of Mormon
1, The single best Japanese text: In all my years of studying Japanese
0," horrible book!: This is a useless book for self-study. It uses an outdated romaji system (""iti"" instead of ""ichi"")"
1, Maleficent is Magnificent!: Loved the costume. I wear a 12-14 great fit. Could also be worn by 16-18. Not too long falls right at the floor just like in picture. The head accessories and cape do stand up just like in pic. One side of my hat was a little floppy when I tried it on I just placed it under a heavy book for a day and that fixed the issue. Looked awesome when put on. Scared everyone at work LOL!!!!! Kids loved it too!
1, Skims the surface: This book is interesting but not overly so. In this case some names have come up that are not well known to the general public. John Cincotti for example has been associated with Genaro Angiulo but also with escort services in Massachusetts.One of the least discussed connections is that between organized crime and 'legitimate business'. Corporations use escort services and the like but the connection with organized crime is seldom considered.Flemmi and Bulger are alleged to have been involved with this.
1, Great Story but a Tad Slow: This is an intriguing tale of corruption and total failure by law enforcement to monitor its informant activities. The story goes into great detail regarding the FBI's truly unholy alliance with Boston's under world crime figures and at times this detail seemingly slows the story down. All in all this is a great story that will leave you scratching your wondering how the heck could such a collapse of the justice system occur?
1, Very interesting!: I enjoyed this and learned a lot. Perhaps the only thing more interesting than the case itself might be what the life of a child of Whitey Bulger might have been like. While Flemmi and Bulger were considered gangsters only
1, an excellent introduction to relativity: Highly recommended. The author had years of experience teaching general relativity to adult education classes. He says his many of his students had no mathematics background. He uses a simplified version of calculus. One comes away from this book with a clear(and rigourous) understanding of why E = mc^2
1, Outstanding Album: Have been a fan of W. C Clark's for some time and have several of his other albums
1, excellent read: Loved it. The characters are evolving with each book and I am really beginning to care what happens to them.
1, Jeffrey Archer: My first J. Archer book! I truly enjoyed the story. Good details
1, Book by Jeffery Archer: I am a big fan of Jeffery Archer. Enjoyed this book as I did so many of his other books. His stories keep you wanting to read on
0, This was possibly the most dull and unsightful book.: This was possibly the most dull
1, He is such a good writer: I love this book. I bought it in the audiobook format
1, Loan to husband: Loved it! My husband is really going to enjoy it as well; we're both big fans of James Patterson and Tom Clancy
1, AT-TE Tank Gunner Review: This figure is a good figure on its own as well as being a versatile figure to be customized. I have customized this figure to create Commander Cody
0, exceptional book: Of the last 100 murder mysteries I have read I would rate this one in the bottom 10 which I consider to be generous because I have never read anything that put me to sleep faster. I struggled each night to read more than two pages and often found it on the floor the next morning. By the 2/3 point I started skimming
0," A slight addition to an excellent series.: STRIP JACK is not one of the stronger books in the ""Rebus"" series. In this one"
1, Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary: Can't say enough good things about this book. We are just beginning to learn Hindi. This is invaluable to us in learning this challenging language.
1, Another great movie by Uwe Boll: It's sad that so many people fail to give Uwe Boll movies a chance. Postal is another great movie right up there with Bloodrayne as one of my favorite Boll films. The comedy and laughs from this film are genuine and the fact it's out on Blu-ray is just phenomenal. Buy it now!
1, more small astronnomical observatories: It a good book but it is out to date 
0, What kind of crack was Crichton smoking while he wrote this?: This book has nothing to do with anything. Once again
1, An all-time classic: I bought this DVD for my mother for Mother's Day and although she's watched it only once
0, dissapointed: I was dissapointed with quality of the color. It was like looking at old phots that faded with time. They could have done a better job at cleaning up the color. The night sceans were almost purple and the day sceans by the ocean were washed out. For the price of the dvd they could have digitly remastered the entire movie and had a better quality.It wasn't worth the $21
1, Alltime best movie .....ever: I love that I now own this classic film. I find it to be the quintessential film in the musical genre
1, golden oldie: I purchased this item for my aunt. She has been looking for this on DVD for a long time. I found on Amazon and ordered for her. She was very excited. It is one of her old time favorites
0, South Pacific with two disc's number one in it: I received the South Pacific dvd for christmas gift and it had two disc's in it but they were both disc number one
0, My high school play version was better: I saw this play in high school and absolutely loved it. The girl in my high school did a better job of playing Nellie than Mitzi Gaynor did. I rented the movie a few years ago and watched about half of it and turned it off. Last week
0, order not received: i ordered THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....before i ordered this DVD.....was sometime in January 2007 and i paid for top speed delivery.....i received the other DVD in my order but not THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....nothing yet....can u look into where it is please......i have emailed before but have not received any response...and wont order again from AMAZON\thank youGlenda Papac
0," ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II: I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy ""Wonderful Guy"" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks"
0, Should be titled Terrible Pacific.: Film quality wss poor as was the editing. Would return if I could.Edited out most of Brazzis singing which is highlight of show. We had way too much of Mitzi Gaynor.
1, A Good Read!: We don't know if feng shui will straighten out your life
1, Get Your Feet Wet: This book is a good introduction into the world of Feng Shui. It's lighthearted approach makes it an easy read -- and it has succeeding in turning me on to studying the practice more seriously. (I felt that many other feng shui books are overwhelming and intimidating for beginners). The tongue-in-cheek humor gets a little tiring at times... but all in all
1, It Really Works: While visiting my son and his family
0, Don''t waste your time and money on college.: Simply read this book so you know which color to paint your walls in the correct area of your house and move your stuff around in your house. If you believe the ideas in this book and try to implement them you are a full blown nut. I can't believe I bought it. It is going in the trash.
1, great listening
0, Good idea
0, Don't Blame Tiffany Shepis...: Alright
0, Behind the scenes!: Look at the cover of the movie
1, Great debut: This is a great album
1, Some fine piano playing: Interesting collection of tunes to keep your toes tapping. Fun to listen to and daydream about where you might be when he plays.
1, brings back memories: Brings backi memories of when me ans some friends traveled all over SC going todifferent theaters too see the movie
0, Incomplete Product Description!!!!: I ordered this package since I am traveling to Salzburg this year and will see all of these sites. The extra features were intriguing to me.BEWARE - only a very few of them are on the DVD!!!!! Most
1, The sound of music.: The best deal thus far from Amazon ***** the sound of music limited edition Blu-ray DVD set for the low special price was an outstanding bargain. All that was included in the set just the DVD disc elsewhere would have been more thanks Amazon you are Amazing !!
0, Disaapointed: I was mad when I found out it was only a Region 2 movie only.. so i can't play it on any dvd player!
1, Excellent quality image.: We purchased this my wife's grandmother who loves Sound of Music. She only recently got blu-ray and a large flat-screen
0, Disappointing: Though the DVD has some really nice extras (interviews
0, Check to make sure the item will play on your equipment: The item was received on time
1, Great BluRay: An ageless wonder with hours of extras. Just in time for Xmas. Thanks Amazon for great price
1, Sound of Music: What a great movie. My 4 year old neice loves it and knows it word for word
1, A true Classic: I have watched these to many times to count. It was so Good that I bought it. Best of the Best.
1, Updated version of a much loved movie!: Purchasing this classic in the Special Edition DVD format was a great move. We can now enjoy it on all our media outlets for a long time to come...
1, Sound of music DVD: First copy was defective. Instantly received a new DVD. Love the DVD. Service for a replacement
1, Good product: This is a wonderful product. I live in an apartment

0, Interesting Story: Story was interesting
0, vampires: This book wasn't to my taste. Not funny enough
1, Judy Garland's Quintessential Christmas She Never Had: This CD is a Laserlight collection of Judy Garland numbers over her years from youth to maturity. Judy herself never recorded a Christmas album
1, GREAT GREAT GREAT: I love this stuff!! Unlike most products that are supposed to take away the rest of your make-up
0, same difference: if you own already own criminal minded on cd you can leave this one alone
0, Don't waste your money: This album is a disaster. It deserves one star because I bought it without listening to it prior to the purchase. They turn 180 degrees away from the blues and try to rock out. My coffee cup has been resting on it on my desk after the first listen. Save your hard earned money and buy everything else they put out. The other stuff is great. This is a joke.
0, No Justice done to the book: The book was alot better than the movie. Disney changed to many key details which gave the book more adventure. They also added some unneeded pasts in the video. The book was historical fiction and I give it 5 stars.
1, Johnny Tremain: I have used this movie in mySocial Studies classes on theAmerican Revolution. My movie is a little worn and now I hve both video and VHS
1, A classic: Johny Tremain is Disney's telling of a young man's involvement in the beginnings of the American Revolution. Is it dated? Yes. Is it oriented to a young audience? Definitely. Is there dramatic license taken at times. Yep. But at the same time this is one of those movies that Disney
0, Second rate home movie: Charlie Sheen produced this home movie starring his father (Martin Sheen)
1, The book that started a movement: As a reader of many Titanic books
1, Definitive book. But what about the sequel?: This is the best book
1, Excellent: Such a fascinating book told to the author by the survivors of the sinking of the Titanic. I read this over the anniversary weekend of the sinking of the Titanic. I can highly recommend this book.
0, grill cover: I was very disappointed in this product; it is made of very flimsy material and tears very easily; it is also not as big as I expected; do not recommend at all.
0, Thermos Cover-2-go: Thermos Cover-2-Go 4187018 by Char-BroilI found that the cover did not fit over my Thermos grill unless one of the sides were folded in and the 1lb gas cylinder was unhooked from its recommended position. I assumed that the cover was to protect the grill while it was fully open for use. Did I misunderstand how the cover should be used?
0, This book is a real downer: I am usually receptive to this type of book given that I am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies. However this book depresses me. The author throws meaningless barbs at everything in his path. No new information is found in the book that cannot be found better presented elsewhere. Indeed some of the information is wrong or dated. In addition
1, worth every penny: I love this machine! Takes 2 to 5 minutes to input ingredients and a couple of hours later
0," Impossible!: I have order THREE of these in the last two weeks trying to get ONE that actually wasn't damaged. The first one arrived Christmas morning with a BIG dent in it. The second one arrive with a dent AND had CRUMBS in it! The third one just arrived -- and you guess it - was DENTED and had dust and dirt in it! I give up! Amazon has a SERIOUS quality assurance problem with these units! I would STRONGLY suggest that if you really want this Bread Machine that you wait until they get another ""batch"" -- or find another retailer."
0, Need help! Top keeps falling...: I just bought this item & have made 6 loaves now. All have failed as the top & sometimes the sides
0, Decent machine but not durable: I have been using bread machines for over 20 years. This was my 3rd bread machine. It only lasted 2 years. It may be OK for basic white breads but the motor was not strong enough for my multigrain whole wheat bread. It died a month ago and I replaced it with a West Bend Hi-Rise bread machine. The bread from the West Bend is much better than anything I ever made with the Breadman.
0, I should have listened to the reviews: I read the reviews and thought I would throw the dice. Well I lost. I ordered the Breadman for my family that have all been recently put on a gluten free diet. We made one loaf that came out delicious. Two days later I poured in all the ingredients (which are extremely expensive) and turned the machine on. The machine gave a few clicks and that was it. Dead........... I should have listened to all the reviews that stated the same scenario. It obviously happens a lot. I am extremely disappointed in this product and I think that The Breadman corporation needs to do some additional quality control.
1, I am a baker now!: I have never been handy in the kitchen - but since getting this Breadman unit
1, gluten free cycle works great!: Pros: Price was great and after two loafs and so far so good. It cooks up our gluten free breads using the gluten free cycle very quickly and easily.Cons: bread pan is aluminum a bit thin and will likely be the first part to fail. 2 of the buttons were a bit scuffed
1, Great Breadmaker: I really researched breadmakers before I bought this one and found it to be a bargain compared to other breadmakers costing twice as much. It makes very good bread and also beeps when you need to add more ingredients to the process. I haven't used the feature for dough but that will come soon. The only gripe I have is that there is no indicator to take the dough blade out before baking. It's really no big deal but if you don't remove it
0, Selling Reconditioned as New: I purchased this breadmachine as a new item and it came with the top & sides scratched and the side dented. I called and Amazon sent a replacement which was in almost the same condition. They said there was a problem with their ordering. When you select a certain item number it's pulling it as reconditioned. They hope to have it fixed in a week. I'm not sure if they even know what they are talking about. I'm looking elsewhere for the same model.
1, I Love This Thing!: I bought this bread maker over a year ago and it hasn't rested for more than one week since then.I am an extremely lazy cook
0, Good bread ??: I read reviews over and over they say this makes great bread. I use the timer setting and it does not work. The bread is also very dense. I had two successful loaves and 2 loaves that did not mix in all the flour and the breads were not edible. I thought maybe the recipes it came with weren't correct so I checked an old bread machine recipe book I had and it had basically the same ingredients. I did not want this for the gluten free option
0, The paint chips off - toxic?: We bought this breadmaker when we started eating gluten free as it has a gf mode. We have not had any successful loaves that way
0, Heating defective: Add me to the list that received a defective machine. I really like the style and the features of this machine. However
1, Best Bread Machine Ever!: I have never owned a bread machine and I am just getting into baking bread in general. I thought it would be great to make homemade bread instead of buying it from the store
0, Noisey: We are really disapointed with this bread maker. It is so noisey and we don't like the size of the loaf of bread. Frankly
1, Really Funny: I read this book in the bookstore and I caught myself laughing out loud! The pictures are great and the quotes are really funny! If you love animals
1, Hilarious: As the human companion of two cats gone bad
0, Bad Cat Selections for Calendar: The [...] website has such wonderful and funny cat photos. I added my cats to the site when it first got started several years ago. However
0, One of the absolute worst dvd releases i've encountered.: This movie is awesome.Now that i've gotten that out of the way
1, Great Kung Fu Flick: I love to watch Kung Fu movies
0, Don't buy this...: The legend (1 & 2)
1, Different: This movie
1, Great way to organize remote controllers: These are a great way to keep your multiple remotes organized and your tabletop clutter free. I bought 2 of the black.
1, amazing!: i realli think this book is worth it. it teaches you how to draw man and female
0, Dangerous ideas: Supposedly Dr. Denmark helped develop the pertussis vaccine in the 1930s. That's noble. However
1," One of the few sure-fire laughs in print.: ""The World According to Student Bloopers"
1, Highwave Original Autotray Stoneware Mug: I ordered a 12 ounce
1, BIG MOMMA IS THE BOMB: This movie was funny! I would rate it afterthe movie Friday which is funny too. Malcom( Martin Lawrence) Was funny in this movie playing as Big Momma. The plot of the movie is to capture a criminal who robs banks and kills people. The robber's girlfriend Sherry(Nia Long) is accused of the robbery with her boyfriend. Sherry's grandmother who is big Momma has to go away. The special agents Malcom(Martin Lawrence) and his other sidekick must get to Sherry in order to capture Lester. Malcom dresses as Sherry's grandmother. They have the funniest times together in Big Momma's house.It may not make sense but if you rent or buy the movie then you will understand how the movie is and how funny it is.
0, Uninspired Comedy: This movie is only for die hard Martin Lawrence fans. Essentially
1, Big Momma's House: Haha. This movie was pretty funny. I seen it along time ago I think when it came out in theatres. Anyways
0," The laughs do not come BIG!: The problem with this so called ""comedy"" is that we have seen it all before. I mean it's a cross between 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'The Nutty Proffesor'. This is such a dull 'comedy' that only raises a few titters. The film is all too clich`e...Cop goes undercover..cop falls for pretty girl...sentimental messages sent etc...YAWN! Martin Lawrence also tries too hard to be the Eddie Murphy character and he tries so hard but it all falls flat in what I could say was the ""WORST COMEDY OF 2000"". The concept has been done before and done much"
0, Much closer to a bodice-ripper than sci-fi/fantasy.: With 2 simple changes - changing the genders back
0, Not worth the time to read...: This book is not worth the time to read. The plot is convoluted and unbelievable
1, bloodlines of shackleford banks: Wonderful and surprising story. Her first book was captavating but this one far surpasses it. Hope she writes more as I am anxious to continue the travels with all the characters. Author has a very good way with words. This is a MUST READ book.
0, Disappointing book from Berg
1, A Sensational Music Video Tribute to Planet Earth: Probably no other director has made as many long form music videos as Don Barrett. The Wonderful Planet was commissioned as an Earthday tribute to our home world. Shot on all seven continents it depicts a natural world that is quickly disappearing. Especially noteworthy is Forest of the Amazon; a reminder of what is happening to the great rain forest. I loved it and so did my children
1, too short a taste...: I wish this album was longer; that's the reason it didn't get five stars. I wanted more. Mayfield four was a powerful live act with a great deal of potential; I wish this was longer to show that in the light the band deserves. They were over too quickly in my opinnion
0, not good: The dolphins screach
1, Excellent product.: This is a fantastic product. I use it for much more than just window flashings.... anywhere a moisture barrier is needed. I also use small pieces to repair tears in building paper before the stucco is applied. My only complaint would be that it's hard to find the ripcord and pick it out of the release on the back. Once you find it and get it started
0, hope it gets better: This cd is my first from this band. From the soundbites they sounded interesting but this is my biggest disappointment from newer prog bands. They fit in better with Spandau Ballet than any where else. The vocals are too sappy and melodramatic and the guitar work is just ok until he starts trying to go beyond his talent level. The rest of the band is adequate but seem to be limited to their frontman.
0," Warning! Multiple Problems!: Be aware! The tracks currently listed for this album as of 5/13/09 are incorrect! Amazon has this album confused for another. Just look at the cover art. Some of the correct tracks are there and they are not the same as the ""listen"" samples provided. I was foolish enough to buy this CD without carefully examining the cover. It should also be known that the sound quality of the ACTUAL tracks is absolutely horrible. Do not buy this disc!The correct track list is as follows:1. Just A Little Misunderstood2. Sparky Rides3. Red Ballroom4. Why Does It Go On5. The Day Will Come6. I Just Got Some7. Shake8. Bright Lights"
0, Couldn't finish this book: I know it's incredibly popular and I have a handful of friends who loved this book. Half of the words are made up
1, Read the Book before seeing the movie: For those who have not seen Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation of this book
0, Sick and disturbing... it's alarming so many people found this an entertaining read.: Just couldn't bring myself to finish this extremely disturbing read. Yes the strange dialect of funky slang is very off putting at first
1, Possibly the best book I've ever read: Since there are hundreds of other reviews
1, horrorshow: This book is incredibly thought provoking and profound. Its been my favorite book for a long time. It's electricifingly fast paced and has several awesome plot twists.
1, a response to madness: this book is an amazing feet of acomplishment. i mainly have a prblem with the reviewer who gave it a bad grade. your reasons where because you thought there where a million books like it
1, Move over Charles Foster Kane: Without doubt the best film yet made! It should be seen by anyone who claims to be knowledgeable about film.
0, Lemonlime: This movie was like watching paint dry. These critics are all lemmings. A few well-known authored critics give a movie raves
1, I really enjoyed this movie!: I had never heard of this movie when I stumbled on it late one night right before I went to bed. Instead of turning off the TV because it was late and I needed to go to work the next day
1, WONDERFUL CD!: The Echoes of Nature Series is absolutely wonderful! I listen to this CD all the time. In fact
0, Light music: One star at best. Put me to sleep. Could have listened to my other Santana cd's with same result. Actually my other cd's sound better than this one as far as reproduction goes.Have to agree with the Ohio viewer
1, The Contents of This Book: This is a faithful reprint of an important collection of short stories by Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951)
0, broken: This arrived a couple of days ago
0," book: Not at all what I expected. I was looking more for an ""emergency"" type book"
1, Very complete guide: I suppose I was looking for more of a pet first aid book. This one goes well beyond procedures I'd feel comfortable doing my self.
0, Bummer: Tina Fey - throw Amy a line and get her out of this awful show. It's painfully bad
1, Excellent Tale of the Times: Tom Rice and (the author of the original book) have captured a period
0, I was disappointed.....: I am doing a diet for Candida (and yes
1, Yummy!: I am so glad I found this cookbook. When I bought it
0, Don't buy the Kindle version: The Kindle version for the iPad is unusable. It has no table of contents and no other apparent way to look around for recipes. It seems to have been treated like a novel where you would read through from front to back. Want to find a recipe for breakfast or a chicken recipe? Good Luck.
1, Buy your own!: I am back in the kitchen! I LOVED to cook at one time
0, Waste of $$$: While there may be 500 recipies in this cookbook I only found a handful that interested me an most of those were less than edible. You can get low carb recipies for free on the adtkins website. Also the food network is going to have a new low carb show in the near future. Don't buy this book.
0, This book does not inspire me: I believe this book is full of padding
0, poor quality transfer: I loved this version of Dracula however the DVD video quality is terrible. Many scenes are very dark. Scenes are so dark that skin tones are nearly dark orange. I would love to have this movie in Blue-Ray!
0," Poor quality image for the first third of the DVD: This was a disappointment. The ""day for night"" scenes early in the story are murky black. There are many scenes that are insufferably dark until about the second third of the movie. Also"
0, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: The batteries were not the same as what they said they were
1, Good book
0, rehash: I LOVED the dragon rider series. 20 years ago I had read everything that McCaffery had ever written. Lately it seems like each McCaffery book I read is more of a disappointment than the last. This book is nearly identical to The Rowan. The plot is recycled. The characters are two dimensional. McCaffery doesn't put any effort into her writing anymore.
0, VHS not DVD: Ordered a DVD of this movie
0, Fossilized Customs: It is obvious that White was trying to make a point- The problem being that his point was both erroneous and ridiculous- It is people like White that the Apostle Paul warned the churches about
0, Slander against Islam: I had heard good things about this book and probably agree with much in it
1, Best reading material ever !: This is the most informative book I've ever read and I believe that everyone should buy this book and have it near your bible for reference.
1, The best game!: This is by far the best game I have ever played. Fun
0, Too too precious: Jenny Lee is the author of another book written prior to this one which seems to have received decent reviews
0, Would have benefitted from editing: As the obsessed owner of a blinded-at-birth basset hound
1, Love Starman!: This is a classic and should be treated as so. I love this movie and watch it all the time now that i have the DVD. Fully worth the $7.36 i paid for it back in March from inetvide.
1, Interesting
0, Looks Better Than it Operates: The two phones are handy
1, Awesome: This is one of the funniest stand up comedians I have ever seen. Almost as good as Robin Williams!!
1, awesome!!: I had this before
1, Combs work fine
0, These are spring loaded and work well
0, don't fit the clippers: I ordered these to fit the blades I was using. I followed the recommendations for which blades they would fit with. They are much too small to fit any of the blades I use on my andis clippers. I would not recommend these.
1, Good Movie: It was a surprisingly good movie. It would have been great if it was available in English with optional subtitles.
1, LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!!: LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!! LOVED IT!!!The story
0, A good movie ruined by horrible video quality: This review is only for the version of this movie sold by Amazon and provided on a DVD-R disc. I don't know about the other versions but this one is pure garbage. First
1, Superb even to a six year old: After twenty-five years
0, shame shame shame: Dersu is one of my favorite films of one of my favorite directors. What a shame it did not get an adaquate treatment on DVD. The pictorial quality is inferior awful and disgusting. If You love this film don't buy this product.
1, Capitan! Dersu! A movie of race
0, Dersu Usala: Greatly disappointed-not translated into English-as well as no subtitles. Have viewed this movie before
1, Ultimate Piano Collection: A very massive collection of classical piano masterworks. A great way to get started on your classical music collection. The one missing star on my product rating for this product is that this collection is missing is a disc of Igor Stravinski... Stravinski's Petrushka is one song that should have been included! But maybe that will be in the part 2 of the ultimate collection?
0, Phone will not last: As others mentioned
0," I swear that when I ordered this ""puppy"" was nowhere in the description.: I thought I was purchasing the ""Dunbar training method"" I guess in retrospect the fact that it is geared to puppies is obvious. That is when people train their dogs"
0, Not appropriate for children.: Art is beautiful but content is not appropriate for children. Possibly appropriate for a high school student but not for an elementary student. Certainly not appropriate for a preschooler. This is classified as an illustrated children's book. I would recommend reviewing the book in a library or a bookstore prior to purchasing it on amazon so as not to risk the time
1, why no usa dvd format?!: I loved this movie so much that when it was over I started watching it again immediately. It was free onDemand from Comcast. The day it vanished from the onDemand menu was one of the saddest days of my young life. And now I can't even find it on DVD. I just don't understand why it can't be available in America! I mean
1, Very funny book set in exotic places: This book had me laughing at nearly every page. The situations Halliday gets into on her very-low-budget travels are mostly of the distressing variety: illness
0, Not so satisfied: I was really excited about this bath tub for my baby. As soon as I was done using it I would either wash it
1, An original singer
0, album: i was looking for a rare version of this. some sellers lead you to think it is another version with Judy Dench. That version is so much better!!!
0, very poor quality: toy was in very poor quality voice box did not workhad battery leakage inside toy when toy arrived
1, Jackie Chan does it again!: You can't go wrong with Jackie. This is definitely one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies! The plot's twists and turns will keep you guessing 'till the very end. Jackie does some of his best fighting
1, BATMAN: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. IT IS VERY FUNNY(TO ME ANYWAY). OTHERSMIGHT THINK IT IS SILLY. I'LL LET YOU FORM YOUR OWN OPINION ANDSEE IT FOR YOURSELF. JACKIE CHAN IS AN UNBELIEVABLE KUNG-FU ARTIST. ONE PARTICULAR SCENE(LIKE YOU NEVER HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE)HAD ME LAUGHING FOR A LONG TIME. ENJOY IT!! I KNOW I DID....
1, Great for climbing
1, updated and contemporary barbie: The Marisa doll is of course beautiful
1," Good quality product: I bought 2 of these helmets for my grandkids for bike riding and they are the best helmet for kids.The kids like the way they fit compared to others they had and they like that they are not heavy and are pretty ""kool"" looking too :)"
1, This is my new favorite book: I definatly approve of this book. I was drawn in and each chapter pulled me into the next. I fully recomend it

1, Caring for yourselg and your aging parents: A must read for the young generation
0, Beware 83 min. VHS version with the yellow cover art!: Black Sunday is a classic film that
1, The Big Question: This is not a review because I have not yet seen this particular blue ray incarnation of the film. It's a question. Is this going to be the European version
0, A classic masterpiece ruined with very poor audio.: The film was everything I expected except the audio is exteremly horrible. The vloume rises and falls and is interlaced with intermittent annoying static clicks. It is unacceptable.
0, Great Movie
0, Dubbed Version.: I hate watching dubbed movies. I would much rather watch a film with sub-titles than hear some goofball voice-overs. The only thing worse is Black Sabbath (the film) because it was shot in English
1, Best horror ever!: Sure it's a bit campy
1, A must have in every chef's library: One killer recipe after another in this book. Outstanding suggestions and photos
1, Too small: This is a very well made product

1, I love it: I guess I'm a bit of a geek and I just love the character of Gollum in The lord of the Rings movies and in The Hobbit. At the same time I think Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor

0, Better potato books out there: While this may be a handy reference to the world of licensed potatoes
1, If you own a shepherd 
0, Appalling in its disregard for the truth...: ...this movie is one of the greatest pieces of distorted disinformation ever made. The infamous Nazi and Soviet propaganda film makers or even Oliver Stone have nothing on mike moore. What's really scary is that plenty of Americans think that this movie is factual.
1, Well worth the viewing: What a terrific movie and insight into the problems that the United States faces on a daily basis. I have heard many critical reviews but mainly from people who are just afraid to even begin to conceptualize the problem. I bought this DVD when it came out a few weeks ago and have already watched it twice
0, bowling for truth?: please see bowlingfortruth.com it will straitin you out on this issue. the movie is a fake. lies all the way. its actually funny how he lies and spins the facts.i am a fan of dockumentarys and there are plenty of facts to support his views so why is it he has to lie? any way just check it out.www.bowlingfortruth.comthanks a lotenjoy your day.PhiPPs
0, Just what you would expect from Michael Moore: Michael Moore tells a good story
0, LENI RIEFENSTAHL OF THE AMERICAN LEFT: Michael Moore is talented
1, A sobering documentary: Bowling for columbine is another proof of micheal moore's talent in filmaking. The film is an interesting and sobering look at gun control and the state of our society. Moore manages to provoke alot of thought throughout the film on the way the United States is as a society and how we love our guns. The film manages to be very interesting and at times funny but it does not stray away from the sobering truth of the chaotic state of gun crime in the US. The film may not be as gripping as other micheal moore films such as Farhenheit 9/11 but it certainly comes close.
1, An important movie: If you are looking for a scary movie (and I mean REALLY scary
0," GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE...: It's those damn bullets!We all know this movie is about attacking the Constitution and the few remaining fragments of our right to bear arms.Every Michael Moore movie is unwittingly a documentary on the dangers of ""Super Sizing"" your every hourly meal. Everybody"
0, IT SUCKS! LIES AND NO TRUTHS: GOD I HATE THIS MOVIE!AND THIS SO CALLED HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR
0, Not a chance: This is the most disgusting thing I have seen. How dare Mr. Moore capitalize on the deaths of men
0, A documentary?: I am all for creative artistry
1, Must See: It is the duty of every American
0, Torturous: I feel Roger & Me was one of the most important films made about the crime that corporate America committed and is still committing against the working class. Now Moore is becoming a caricature of himself. The blue-collar look that worked well for Roger & Me is clearly phony facade. Moore's cynicism and just plan meanness at times has no home in working class America. It is liberal Hollywood all the way.
0, screwy film
0, Knee-jerk liberal tripe scapegoatism at its worst.: The epitomy of revisionist history/liberal misinformation at its absolute worst. If you don't like to think for yourself
0, VERY MISLEADING: Oscar...?????????????????????? Why? This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. This is a badly conceived
0, Misleading: I watched this documentary and was surprised by many of the things Moore claimed. It was hard for me to believe much of it
0, Arrogance unleased...: This man is perhaps the most arrogant individual I have seen in quite sometime. Took the time he should have spent being thankful for recieving an an Academy Award (wrongly bestowed uopn him for this piece of left-wing [junk]) to bash the president on national television! Wrong time
1," Not a Comedy: I just noticed that Time magazine reviewed this movie as ""Hilarious"". Huh?? What were they thinking???This movie was anything but funny. Most of this movie"
0, i'm not impressed with this movie AT ALL: when i saw this film 
0, Do Not Trust This Man: Michael Moore made what I thought was an entertaining
1, An important one for thinking people everywhere!: To say this film is about antigun ownership is foolish. The reviewer that wrote that
0," mockumentary: if this is what hollywood considers an award worthy ""documentary"" "
0, More lies than are allowable: So many technical lies about guns and gun control and the American people this is unusable except as the rankest vile progressive propaganda. If you believe most any of this is true you need a reality check. Moore stacks more BS than most and does it with such hypocritical assurance that only the gullible will be taken in.
0, Moore is a joke: Normally documentaries are based on fact and not fiction. I guess when the facts don't agree with your left wing agenda you can just make stuff up and be rewarded by hollywood.
0, I like Moore
0, Full of Half-Truths and Publicity Stunts: At the very least
0, Bogus: Ok I'm Not One To Slander People But This Is Copmletely Bogus. At One Point He Makes It Seem Like He Bought A Gun With No Background Check.. In Actuality The Producers Went to The Store Earler and Pre-Bought The Weapon. Also This Is A Good Movie For The Anti Americans To Buy If You Don't Like The U.S And You Do Like Terrorism And Dictatorships Than Buy This Movie. I For One Will Avoid This Movie At All Costs After Wasting Money To See It In The Theaters. I'm Not Saying Don't Buy It I'm Just Giving You My Opinion Take It As You Will.
0," A clever piece of fiction: This so-called ""award-winning documentary"" is neither very award-winning nor"
0, Many things but not a documentary: Moore has gained a reputation for playing fast and loose with the facts and numbers to make his point
0," Left-wing propaganda: Michael Moore is no better than Bill O'Reilly.. he distorts facts to suit his agenda just like O'Reilly does. Moore also uses the veneer of a documentary style to disguise lies in narration and editing. Watch this movie.. but don't accept any of it's ""facts"" or conclusions."
0," If Only Moore Would Have Produced A Documentary: That this film is still being called a ""documentary"" is a slap in the face of those who produce documentaries. Moore has very artfully packaged political commentary and sold it as ""truth"". If you Google around the web"
0," LOAD OF GARBAGE: ALL OF MICHAEL MOORE""S FILMS ARE LIES. GUNS ARE NOT A PROBLEM PEOPLE ARE. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WASTE TIME WRITING ABOUT THINGS THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT. ASSAULT WEAPONS DON'T HAVE TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC. NOT LIKE MOVIE GUNS.THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN DID NOT BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. IT BANNED HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE ARE LOOK IT UP.IF YOU CAN'T PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK YOU CAN'T LEGALLY OWN A GUN LET ALONE A FULLY AUTOMATIC ONE.STATISTICS SHOW THAT PLACES WHERE PEOPLE OWN GUNS ARE SAFER. THE BITISH CAN'T OWN GUNS. THE CRIME RATE IS SCARY.BUY A GUN BEFORE YOU TRY TO TAKE MINE"
0," What a farce: This ""documentary"" should be called a propagandamentary. Everyone who praises this film should watch it again. This time turn off the sound and emotions and just watch Heston's tie. You might feel ""had"".I must assume the only reason this film won an oscar is because the nominating commitee never saw it."
0, Moore's a fraud
0, At least Mike has a job.: Not a documentary. It is not to be taken serously. Which is easy because his quote
0, Dissappointed: I am very disappointed in the purchase of the DVD The Perfect Nanny ... I CAN'T EVEN HEAR IT EVEN WITH THE TV TURNED UP . This was the only problem I have ever had with the many purchases I have made . VERY DISSAPPOINTED CUSTOMER
1," a quick and funny read: Bulgakov's ""Heart of a Dog"" is a fantastic introduction to his writing in general. I read this after ""The Master and Margarita"" and found it to be a bit less polished"
1, Phenomenal Read!: Some Price To Pay is an excellent read! It draws you in from the very beginning and is so enticing you can't put it down. Filled with joy
0, Awful book: Really silly. As if a teenager would work for MI5. Melodramatic and the protagonist is uptight and selfish and thoroughly dislikeable. I would recommend War & Peace instead. Avoid sappy teenage drama!Dr. Phil Space
1, Not as good as Scorpia: Ark Angel is more laid back than the book before it
1, Ark Angel!! A cliffhanger literally: I really enjoyed this because because you never want to pt the book down. It is amazing at the age of 14 the boy nearly dies
1, The Most Correct of Any Book on Earth!!!: How many books do you know that claim to be delivered by an angel? To get a sacred record from the Heavens that was translated under the direction of God
1, Pros and Cons: The Book of Mormon is not intended to be a novel
0," Why the elizabethan english?: I don't get the Elizabethan English style in which the book is written....if the book was ""translated"" in the 1800's from ""Reformed Egyptian"" then why in the world is the book written in language common to the 1500-1600's rather than language common to the 1800's? It just doesn't make sense.....unless it is intended to mimic the style of the King James version of the Bible. Oh wait"
0, Utterly Racist !!!!!!!!: I read this book a couple of days ago..Behold
0, 1800s fiction: This book is boring for one thing! It's also stolen from View of the Hebrews written in 1825 by Ethan Smith (no relation to big Joe and yes that's before Joe's visions of grandieur).It's a strange book with nothing to do with the actual Mormon church. Contradicts the bible a lot too.NO proof of any DNA evidence of hebrew people being in the Americas.
1, But Why No Art??: Yes
1, Greatest Book Ever: This book has changed my life
0, Wait for the movie ...: I was going to read the Book of Mormon but thought
0, Nothing Unique and nothing interesting for most people: The Book of Mormon has too many questions attached to it... Ifyou are a Mormon you will love this book
0, Pure fiction: Don't waste your time with the Book of Mormon. Not only is it false
0," Jesus wept!: Holly crap.Some of the final words of the new testement are""Beware Mamon""I wonder if this is a Chronological error?Go read ""sceptisism Inc"" by Bo Fowler...or just kill yourself."
1, Common sense book: I have been a student of the Book of Mormon for years. The more I read the book the more I feel the Lords spirit in my life. I have come to have the feeling that the Book of Mormon is as much holy scripture as the Bible. In fact
0," I was raised to love this book: I read it... over and over as I was told to do. I was bored beyond belief no matter how earnest my attemps at really connecting with the book might have been. I very much wanted to be one of the ""special"" that received a testimony to it's truth so that I could join the elite gang in the hereafter. I was never hooked"
1, INVALUABLE BOOK: Anyone reading this book can gain terrific insights into the mind and hearts of those seeking Christ.Each individual book (or chapter) has a personality that you can feel and nearly see the individual's earnest desire to become closer to God. It is wonderful.For one seeking to better self
0, Not even good fiction: During my over fifty years as a member of the LDS church I read the Book of Mormon six times. I kept waiting for it to speak to me on some level
0, Lackluster work of fictional literature: What happened to Christ after he was crucified and before he went to heaven
0, Get a Free Copy from Marriott: If you have any interest in this book just go to any Marriott hotel and get a free copy from the drawer (this is a very wealthy and secretive cult--they don't need your money.) If you have any interest in Mormonism and 30 minutes to kill
0, False: I first read this book when I was 16 years old. I wish that I never came across this book or those who profess it to be a scripture. Unfortunately
0, Use it as a paperweight.: As believing mormons during our teenage years
0, False Belief System: Amazing that in our times anyone can believe Joseph Smiths fabricated account of American History. DNA
0, Nothing more than a work of fiction!: Customers who purchased this book would also enjoy these fine works of fiction:Star WarsHarry PotterWilly Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryToy Story
0, A bit too shallow: The video is a poor attempt to explain the immerging and effect of the Holy Book of QuraanIt didn't touch base on major aspects of the book that is full of miracles amzing the religious same as scientists of what the context carriesI really recommend researchers to find something on the book that is done by a suphysticated Islamic univercities such as Zaytuna in London or Al-Azhar in Cairo.. and by the European catholic by birth currently Muslim researchers such as Karen Armstrong and the most brilliant Hamza Yusuf http://www.zaytuna.orgThis DVD is good if you can do with a one page brief for an encyclopedia!
1, Great Organizer!: I had been using the Med Sun 4 dose a day organizer and it is really great but when one pill changed to a larger version and no longer fit. I had to try out some alternatives. This is not the handiest set to fill however I do love the fact that the compartments are REALLY deep and the compartments STAY closed.If you take a lot of meds/supplements and are on the go
1, Functional and Fun Pill Organizer: This pill organizer is very helpful. The compartments are deep and can hold many pills. Each box has a morning
0," Misty and Reesy are BACK and BETTER than ever...: ...if you enjoyed Misty's and Reesy's antics in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" and ""Gettin' to the Good Part"" you'll love ""Tastes Like Chicken"".The story picks up with Reesy preparing to get married. Only a ""surprise"" guest shows up at the wedding and the nuptials are halted. This is where the drama begins...the story revolves around Reesy who embarks on a trip across county to get away from the madness"
1, Creating Your Home Creative Window Treatments: This book will make a good addition to any home sewer's library. It's written with a clearly British flavor (flavour?. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. How to's for most of the more common types of treatments are addressed. The authors describe hardware options and illustrate several unexpected and very clever ways to dress your windows. The artwork and photography are well done with some useful decorating suggestions demonstrated. It's not limited to only fabric. Several types of non-fabric treatments are included with some easy to duplicate painting techniques. This book would make a great gift for a new bride or a young person moving into there own place. I'm glad I added it to my collection.
1, SanDisk Review: works well with my phone. i'm happy with the 4GB size as it makes it more convenient (and cheap) for me to just have my music and videos on one device instead of 2 (i.e. ipod + phone). the downfall
0, Not worth it: When this phone first came out
0, Don't buy it: It was working ok but just after the 1 year warranty expired
0, Anticlimatic: I enjoyed Bangkok 8
1, Sonchai's Back!: Imagine my surprise when I saw Bangkok Tattoo in the new release section. I snatched that bad boy up right away! I was really excited for another chance to read more about Sonchai
0, Insulting: Every page insults with racism
0, Disappointed: After thoroughly enjoying Bangkok 8 I was excited to ready Bangkok Tattoo. I found Tattoo to be a boring read
0, Broke after ONE DAY!: The clasp broke after just one night. The fabric is good quality but the latch in the back is made of super cheap plastice that will snap with any force.
1, Perfect: About a week before the chorus I was a part of was to perform portions of the Messiah for Palm Sunday
1, Powerful and Insightful: This was a strong and insightful novel on numerous levels. The ending is not entirely satisfying but this is more than made up for by the character development and the author's commentary on the nature of success
1, I read the entire book in one sitting!: I bought this book on a whim
1, Thoroughly enjoyable: This was my first Wolfe mystery
1, An interesting story of discovery...: I like the way the book presents village life in the Warhammer world. An interesting insite into how villagers should be played in the game. The superstition and agenda of the characters are very well represented (or misrepresented in some cases). The characters are not one dimensional and the main characters are people you can care about. The flow of the book is good
0, The item is not good except the price: The soup spoon is way to big
1, Very pleased: This flatware was a gift for my son and dgtr-in-law. They were delighted with the simplicity of the pattern and the nice weight of the stainless. I was very pleased that they were satisfied with my selection.
1, This is great but the sound is kinda bad.: I love Slayers!!! The story is great
1, Sublime living
1, Works great!: This product does what its supposed to and fits nice and compactly in my secret trunk compartment. It takes a little longer to fill my vehicle tires but that was to be expected since it's not the heavy duty gas station pump.It's only major fault is that it is LOUD during use so would not recommend using during late/early hours unless necessary.
0, This is not an accurate reprint: I don't know if Garth Williams re-drew his illustrations for this reprint
0, Not: The gun is practically locked into the holster. Don't buy this if you think you might need a quick draw.
1, Tiny
0, Yes
1, Very good deal!!!!: I was unsure when I saw this item.... Nonetheless
0," ""World's Tiniest"" is a lie..: I use my 8GB MicroSD card in a USB adapter that is roughly half the size of this device. There is a small loop for a keychain on it which is useful when pulling it out of a usb port... not to mention that pulling out the chip allows use in a cellphone or digital camera (via adapter)"
0, DEAD: I got this for school and it died after only a couple of weeks. It still gets warm when plugged in
0, CHICAGO FAN faceplates: Why arnt there Bears or Whitesox or Bulls or even Blackhawk faceplates. They should make faceplates for every team and sport
0, Worst Book Ever!: If it was possible to give a book negative stars
0, Only for the NYC Fashion Crowd: I love Fashion and love the City so hearing about the designer clothes and the descriptions of living in NYC were great but other than that the book seemed a little weak for all of the hype surrounding it.
0, Skip the book watch the movie: I was really dissapointed in this book. I really enjoyed the film and thouhgt it was funny and somewhat real to our society. Then I read the book and who it was diffrent from the movie and not as good. Maybe I did not like the book as much becouse I seen the movie before I finished the book. The book was boring and I found it really abnoying. I did not like the main charactor she was selfish and anoying where in the movie she was inocent and loving. Someparts where good but not enough to make it a good movie.
1, ON THE SPOT: I NEVER KNEW THAT ONE DAY I WILL FIND A BOOK THAT SPELLS MY WORKING LIFE EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS. IT HAS HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON ITS HEAD. THE BOOK HAS GIVEN ME HOPE BY LETTING ME KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME HELL AS I AM
0, One-Hit Wonder: Unless Lauren Weisberger
0, Disappointing: This book was just a plain disappointment. The first few chapters were very funny
0, Save your Money: I bought this on my way out for a 12 hour flight and wished I'd saved my money...I would have been more entertained reading the Delta Shopper catalogue or the in-flight safety manual. Good premis
1, Excellent: I thought this was a great novel. Andrea
1, Loved it: Funny
0, Don't Believe The Hype !: On the surface there were a couple of amusing moments but this was a depressingly cliched and formualic piece of fiction . What really disappointed me was the lack of rythmn vibrancy and energy in the novel 
1, Far superior to the movie!: This book was an excellent and enjoyable read. It flowed smoothly and was an unchallenging
0, This Prada was a knock-off: I have been in constant anticipation since I heard about this novel a year ago. So needless-to-say I was psyched when summer rolled around and I was able to pick it up and devour it.The book began well but that's it. 100 pages in I was still waiting for character development and a tangible plot. The entire book was one huge rant about how bitchy Andrea's boss was. I felt like saying
0," ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is just dreadful!: In this ""novel"" Lauren Weinberger trashes her boss"
1, Take a Break from those mystery/suspense novels: This book is a most enjoyable read. It is about a woman who graduates from college and wants to be a writer for the New Yorker
0, You too can write a novel: Sadly
0, More boring than...well
0, Complaining does not make a book: This book was one of the worst I've read in the last few years. Filled with designer jargon and the incessant whining of the main character
0, What a waste of time and money: Characters were poorly developed. Read through the whole novel
1, The devil is great: I wonder if all the bad reviews on this book are from people in the fashion industry...hmmm..in any case
0, Read a fashion magazine instead.: If you enjoy reading lists of fashion products you might enjoy reading this book
0, Amateur Hour -- Pageturner but nothing else.....: OK....everyone who has an evil job out of college fantasizes about seeking revenge against their vile boss by writing a tell all novel. Did Michael Lewis start this trend I wonder?So I guess Weisberger is a bit more motivated than most since she actually finished her tome of revenge.Other than a window on wintour's obsessive ways
0, Author doesn't know how to write: I love the movie that was made based on this book so I had very high hopes for the book. Unfortunately
1, Nice to get your mind of things...: The book is entertaining. it's not as hilarious as some critics said it would be but if you are looking for a fun and light story to get your mind of things then this is the book...it did not keep me awake until the early hours of the morning but I enjoyed reading it. It is well written
0, Time NOT well spent: If I could rate this a quarter star I would. Catchy title and cute cover: only polite things I can say. It lacked character and plot development needed to sustain an audience
0, Don't waste your time or your money.: If you must read this then get it at the library like I did. This author is presumptuous to believe she could ever work for a quality
0, So excruciatingly DULL: Wow. This was an unbelievably dull book
1, Mindless Fun!!: This was a fun read. Not exactly educational or full of a lot of substance
0, HEAVEN help me...: I am going to try my best not to throw up all over this POOR excuse for a read! If this were the last book on earth that I had to read just to maintain my last bit of sanity and intelligence
0, Enough Already!: This book is only a hit because people want to see just how much of a rhymes-with-witch American Vogue editor Anna Wintour really is. Fine. We get the picture in the first chapter - she's kennel bait. The rest of the book is a whine and cheese party for the main character who is given a series of jobs to do
0, Tale told by an idiot
0, What a waste of paper!: I am sick to death of books about whiny
0, My 14-yr old neice can write a better written book than this: I don't know what my expectations were
0, So bad!!! Movie was better; I couldn't even finish this book!: I'm just SO over this kind of stuff. Yes
0, Unrelatable: I might have enjoyed this when I was a teenager or in my very early 20's but even just a little bit older and wiser and I found I couldn't relate to the main character at all. She spends the whole time working for this devil
0, Semi entertaining fluff.....but: The book is the equivalent of some of those silly women's magazines that you read at your salon. Fluffy and harmless and fine to pass the time with. I just had to vent however about some of the sloppy writing and a few inaccuracies. Anyone who has ever picked up a fashion magazine knows that Bobbi Brown is spelled with an i not a y (the writer shouldn't use names that she can't spell properly)
0, Boring....: I expected more from this book because of the publicity - Lauren Weisberger even got on the Today show with Matt Laurer. My advice
0, Pure unadulterated garbage: I can't believe I wasted my money on this...! My third-grade cousin is far more skilled at plot development than Weisberger will ever be....if you're really in the mood for an expose
0," I can sum this book up in one sentence...: ""OMG MY BOSS SUCKS WAAAAAH!""There"
0," No Time For Tea: ""THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA"" seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea. I only got through about 1/3 before I cut my losses and donated it to the library book sale. A better choice would be ""TRADING UP."""
0, Weisberger must have signed something over to the devil: Paint-by-the-numbers plot that reads like a third-rate gossip column stretched out over a couple hundred pages; a bland
0, Unnecessary: I liked the basis to which this book was written. However
0, I Can't Even Finish It: I'm the type of person when i start a book i finish
0, Torturous to Read: I had high hopes about this book after watching the movie
0, Sad attempt to clone the pizazz of the Shopaholic series: This book was an desperate attempt to clone the Shopaholic books by Kinsella. Sadly
0, Cliche and contrived: I could not get past page 38 of this unfunny
1, Frogs
1, Great filled with action: Tarzan is one of the best books I have ever read. The book is filled with action that will not let you put the thing down. I garauntee that if you get this book
1, Read the original first...: After all of the film and tv adaptations of this novel over the last 90 or so years it was good to finally enjoy the original version. I have recommended it highly to anyone who will listen. And a big thank you to Amazon for making the classics like this available for free.
1, Fun read!: Ripping story
1, From box to lawn in 10 minutes...: It took me 10 minutes to assemble
1, From Back Cover: A NEW DREAMShe's turned her back on glamour and fame and Kate Stanislaski Kimball had come home to begin a new life. The only thing more perfect than the beautiful - dilapidated - building she'd bought for her new dance school was Brody O'Connell
1, Love this writer!: In my opinion no other writer can come close to this one however there are a lot of writers whose books (stories) I enjoy just as much. This writer and her books are excellent!
0, Disappointing!!: Ms. Roberts did a poor job on this book. I was literally going to sleep reading the book. Considering Kate is very similar to Taming Natasha. The plot was incredibly BORING. However
0, Not good at all: If Nora Roberts wrote this book herself
1, The show themselves once again!: Ahh Kraftwerk
0, How Can She Teach Us?.....: As an author trying to get us to open our minds to other cultures of the world
1, worx battery as advertised: This battery works as advertised. Although I wish it lasted a little bit longer. If you have a decent sized yard
0, Very poor battery life: I purchased two batteries and found that I needed both to completely edge and trim my lawn. A charge only lasted 15 minutes or so and I recharged both after each use. At the beginning of the second year of use
0, It doesn't last.: Don't buy the trimmer or the battery. The battery will die within the first year and will not recharge to capacity
1, Great!: This is the only brand of lamp I will use for my lizards. The only problem I have with them is that the clamp is very difficult to install. Other than that they are great. They are lightweight
0, Beyond Boring: I'm a sophomore in college
1, Have Rack Can Store: I've had this product for a while now and have enjoyed its highly functional features. I purhcased it as table for a stereo component set. It fit on top of the stand perfectly. I was able to conviently store my albums and cds.Its also a fine piece of furniture that would enhance the decor of any room. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs an good place to store there musical investments.
0, not really a neoprene sleeve: This zipper case is actually padded with cheaper polyethylene foam--and only on the 2 large-panel faces of the bag only. The polyethylene foam panels are encased in a jacket of wafer-thin neoprene on the outside and nylon in the inside. Note that the edges of this bag are comprised solely of the thin neoprene/nylon shell
0, Light comedy wiithout substance: This movie has no real substance. It's really pretty awful and really too stupid to be considered good. The invisible man could have been portrayed so much better if just given a bit more thought but I guess no one really cared since the focus is mainly on silly women humping the air. I guess it would be considered light comedy/porn with as much silliness included as possible. Don't waste your money on it unless you are desperate for entertainment of a weak storyline and lots of shots of breast and women's & men's butts which is about all you're really gonna get
0, Melissa's Fresh Guavas: The guavas were not very ripe and did not ripen over time. There were two that could not be eaten.
0, [money] for this? no way!!!: This memory is made of cheap material
0, Terribly disappointing: The Neverending Story has always been one of my favorite books since I was young
0, An alternative point of view: Can I give it less than 1 star? After reading Ende's Neverending Story I was eager to read Night of Wishes. Unfortunately
1, Great Book - but read the original!: This is my favorite book since I've read it 5 years ago. The cat (a little dumb) und the always so pessimistic raven are well worked-out caracters and I really love them. Sometimes I wonder how Mr. Ende managed to invent all those words to describe the ingredients of the notion potion. Beeing German I know both versions - the German original and the English translation
1, An excellent resource for children: This book is easy to read
0, Fish Identification: The book is written for college study
0, total crap: this waste of money has no Kid Rock music or videos.just some people who 'say' they know him and talk about him.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID
0, Totally Sucks: Do not buy this is the worst thing I have ever seen Kid Rock has nothing to do with this.
1, Nice assortment: This is a very nice assortment. I have only then a short time but have used them often.Very happy with them
0, A long read
0, a very deceiving title: At best an introductory book for those who want to know what water planning is
0, This was a waste of money: This really doesn't work. It isn't worth the money and I am sending mine back. It couldn't find even one stud in my new home.
0, don't buy this: The only way this would work well is if you're already good at finding studs. There a very little magnet that will attach when over a metal piece of the wall
1, Great single by 112: Another great song and Remix by 112 this was very hot they go more in Depth on this one some good vocals all thought not Peaches N Cream and Dance with me this should not be missed.Lyrics 10/10 Production 10/10 Style 8/10 Overall 9/10
1, Nice Bowtie for Its Price!: Received the item quickly. The quality of the bowtie is good for its price. Will buy again from this vendor.
1, 4 keeps getting better: Ok so 3 ended with Georgina all preggo
1, Excellent Service: Ordered all the Seasons for a Christmas Gift. Excellent Service
0," NOT FOR ME: ON PAGE 258 THE AUTHOR SAYS "" ANY ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT OF THE PRECEDING LECTURE IS BOUND"
0, Not what it seems: This was not the UK version with Mel Smith although his name appeared in the catalog but the (inferior in my opinion) US version. Still an excellent story but better with the UK voices.
0, Not worth spending money for it: You bye it because you think it's varios Reggaetoneros and it's just females dancing. It went straight to the garbage did not want to spend money on postage again.
1, Like your favourite old sweater: ECHOES was my first exposure to Maeve Binchy
0, small type: I have been unable to read this book
1, Lovely read: Maeve Binchy never disappointed. I enjoyed the story of the characters who sought to achieve the dream of an education
1, I'll continue to read Maeve Binchy...: The little town of Castlebay comes alive in this thoroughlyreadable novel. The characters seem compelling and believable.Small-town mores are depicted realistically
1, Maeve Binchy does it again--great storytelling!: I love reading this author's books. She's great at developing characters. If you are looking for murder and mayhem
0, no magnetic attraction: I thought this product would be a great way to bring a bit of color into my kitchen at the same time organize my knives. Well the color is lovely but the magnet is so weak it won't even hold on light-weight knife. Totally worthless.
1, Rodriguez
1, Read this book!: This is one of the first books that I read for pure enjoyment. It's about a boy named Dennis O'Mally
1, Very comfortable
1, RAUNCHY
1," Hillbilly Women is a great book!: This is a great book to read and to learn how the ""hillbilly"" women grew up. My mother Marie Chandler"
0, Oh
1, Plague of Wonders: This book was not so much about the plague
0, Tiff's review: Year of Wonders in my view was not all that of a book. It took place in the time of the plague
1, Oh yeah
1, Unforgettable work -- hard to believe it's really fiction: 'Year of Wonders' is a fantastically well-written novel based on the real English village of Eyam
1, great book: this is a really good book! i got it for a study abroad class and actually got to visit the village of eyam in england. Though this work is fiction much of the information is based on true information. fast shipping and good quality
1, My favourite book: I've read this book three times! It rekindled my interest in historical fiction on a new level. Write more please Geraldine.
1, Year of Wonders: This author really researches well; you can almost put yourself in that time frame of the 1666 plague. The characters are well developed
1, A good read: This is a novel worth reading
0, Not what I expected: I heard about this book on NPR
0, Save your money!: I am in total agreement with the person who wrote that this book is an imposition of the author's 21st century politically correct views on to the 17th century. There are so many things that happen to Anna and yet she is detached and lucid and clear about through it all
1, One of the best: This historical fiction novel will grab you from the first page and keep you glued through the last. Superbly researched and written at times the plot twists leave you gasping in surprise. Wonderfully done!
1, Black Death!: I can't get this story out of my head since I read it from a library on a European river cruise. I was there in Europe where this unfortunate situation took place. The story placed a personal perspective on this disaster - now for me
1, Year of Wonders: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There is a surprise twist at the end
0, Could have been: This book could have been so good. But instead of focusing on the truly great story that is the Plague and the people who lived through it
1, Such a sweet novel: I know that this is a book about a adultery
1, A great book!: I read That Camden Summer while on vacation last year and I read it in one day. The book was so good I bought another Lavyrle Spencer book immediately! I read Bitter Sweet by the pool and I was crying within a half hour! The bond that the reader will feel with all the characters is instant. This book is dear to me because I live in Wisconsin and I am very familiar with Door County and its irresistable charm. Brookie so reminds me of my good childhood friend
1," Kraftwerk 2 - ahead of its time?: Kraftwerk 2 was the first of the ""old"" Kraftwerk albums I got. It is an unusual album (like Kraftwerk 1)in that it uses no synthethisers...but the unusual sounds they got from ""normal"" instruments make this one of the best liked records in my collection. The track ""Klingklang"" is just over 17 minutes long"
1, Hopeful romantice: This book was loaned to me by a co-worker. I'd not read any of Wiggs's books before
0, Very Raw USBM: Kult Ov Azazel is one of the rawest USBM bands I've listened to in a long time. This album is intenely brutal from beginning to end. There's no atmospheric touches here
0, Interlinear Greek-English New Testament: The print is so light most of it is unreadable for me. The same volume is available on-line to use for free.
1, Needed for college: I am starting college today and although I have not read the book fully yet I have opened it and looked inside it was on my textbook list and seems like it could be very helpful. Good book for college students or anyone in the industry really
0, Awful DO NOT get this: This was made of terrible quality and literally broke taking it out of the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!! It is total garbage!!!
0, IM VERY UPSET: UBI for all the hype you spread on this expansion pack it was not worth the 30 I paid for it. The maps lag really bad. Just like the other people said before I get 30-70 FPS on maps but the maps from athena only get 10-15 max and that makes for very poor game play. About the only thing i say is nice from athena is the CTE game mode.From a very upset loyal raven shield player my loyalty is wearing thin very thin.
0," VERY DISAPPOINTED: I Don't know how they can say plump and juicy..my were dried out so hard I could crack them in my hand.The delivery time wasn't bad.....too bad the black berries were of such poor quality.' Were these supposed to be freeze dried? It didn't mention that in the description nor any instructions as how to ""plump em' back up""?I'm very disappointed."
0, Traumatized: What a disappointing movie!My high hopes and excited anticipation were smashedupon the jagged rocks of mediocrity.It had potential
0, Interesting
0, Too bad it doesn't work with Windows 7: It started out GREAT
0, Excellent movie
0, Not entertaining enough: ever since i caught the accent on these peoples voices i knew it would not be the best movie
0, A Misleading Movie That Overwhelmingly Let Me Down: As an avid movie critic
0, Not DVD worthy: 28 Days
1," THERE IS TERROR: The two ""28"" movies are both excellent. They are not farce"
1, This is a Thriller
0, Great movie - not blu-ray quality: Ok so this review will be short and sweet. The movie rocks - however if you are looking for HD quality - 1080p don't buy this product. There was significant artifacts
1, Danny Boyle is a genius!: This movie is amazing
1, When I saw this movie on the big screen I had to buy it: When I saw this movie on the big screen I knew I had to have it in my collection
0," Much Ado About Nothing: I wonder why ""28 Days Later"" is proclaimed a groundbreaking take on zombie horror. Could it be because it offers neither zombies nor much horror? Granted"
0, Harmful: As I said in the title Harmful. Not very stimulating
0," This movie SUCKS: I give this ""1"" star"
0, More Hollywood Garbage: This movie likes to think that it has a very original plot. It does not. This movie is a pathetic attempt on a plot that has been used over and over again in much better movies. The acting sucks and the movie is so BORING. I couldnt wait for it to be over. There was a total lack of suspense and the opening of the film is the the most boring and mundane that I have ever seen. P.S. This movie is NOT scary. Anyone that thinks so has a very very limited experience with horror. Skip this crap.
1, Scary!: This movie was scary when I first saw it. It has good acting and a good story and plot. I recommed this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies.MPAA: RRunning Time: 113 minutesYear released: 2003
1, Terrifying psychological thriller...: Extremely terrifying psychological thriller with a basis not that far from reality. What if one day entire populations were wiped out by a highly contagious disease? Before anyone rolls their eyes at the pretext of the situation the movie is based on
1, Not a Zombie flick: If you're looking to be scared stiff
0, Great film HORRIBLE BLU-RAY: The film is 5 stars
0, hate it more then anything: I hate to even waste my time writing a review for this junk! But if a save one person from seeing this film it was all worth while. It's too bad they could have made this film alot better but it's to late. It's not worth the 3.00 to rent it and DON'T even think about buying it!! OK I'm done bi***ing now!
0," Extremely bad quality transfer: Don't buy this ""high definition"" disc unless VHS is your definition of HD. Transfer is simply horrible - blown highlights"
0, Don't Buy This If You Respect Yourself: I love horror movies. I really do. This isn't a horror movie
1, Live Good: Live Good is a great book to keep around for yourself
0, I would have given it zero star.: I have an Athlon 1.4GHz machine. The temperature monitoring software came with my motherboard indicates a cpu temp of 59 under ME consistently. The funny thing is this same software shows my cpu temp is always 46 under win2k and xp.This is not the only problem I had with my ME. There were also millions of crashes
1," Much Better than Win98SE: ME is much more reliable and efficient. New features like active ""start"" menu bar which hides less used shortcuts gives you better and tidy looking menus. Very useful for people like me. But it slows down the system as usual..."
1, Not too bad: This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems. Unfortunately it is also the last in that line. The flexibility of having a modern operating system with Dos compatibility was a great idea so long as it was handled correctly.
0, Garbage: I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning. Crashes like there's no tommorw. Security holes the size of the ozone.
1, Delicious Collection of Many Kinds of Breads: You know this is my favorite bread cookbook because this is where I stick news clippings of other bread recipes! The standout feature is the many variations on themes of breads
0, Poorly written pediatric review: this is
1, The best $12 I have spent in a long time.: Toby's album is so wonderful. Every single song is well written and sung beautifully
1, beauty in simplicity: I've been a long-time lover of artists who write their own lyrics
1, Inspiring and awesome!: The Gaither Red Rock Homecoming DVD
1," Good for Beginners: I'm a fan of Nancy Kress's how-to books for Writer's Digest Press. Some of these books are better than others. I particularly like ""Beginnings"
0, Poor quaity: Bought this as bridesmaids gifts and had to return this item. Item more suited for a child. Pendant ok but chain thin and of poor quality.
1, Good
0, Starts good
1, Easily one of the best: Anyone who says Gundam Wing is better than Gundam Seed
0, Surfing rocks
1, Knife Pouch: Bought this pouch for a Swiss Army Knife Cybertool seperate from the knife. It's a good quality product. I just do not understand why they don't offer them as a set.
1, Movie Review: This is a very good movie. However it might be a good idea to view it a couple of times. The Irish accent in great but one has to have a good ear to understand all of the dialogue.
0, Stewie Doll: I purchased this doll to use as part of a Halloween costume but the trick was on me! The doll came in a filthy plastic bag
0, Didn't work: It came
1, Detailed inffo inside
0, Pretty Boring: I was looking forward to this book
1, Such a wonderful story: I loved this book so much
1, Good Stuff!: I've read several of Alice Hoffman's books
1, Stunning Hard Times: This book is so insightful and current at the same time. It is as though it was written last week. The personal perspective puts you right in the middle of their lives.
0, Did not inflate my bike tire inner tubes: Brand new and though it pushes air and the gauge seemed to work
0, From nothin' to nothin': Well just got done listening to fab's album and after a blood vessel popped in my eye I decided to write a review. The two stars I gave for the album are for the beats only. The lyrics on this album are weak and infantile. On return of the hustle fab uses Beyonce's lyrics (to the left
1, Excellent down to earth from down under.: This is a very interesting book. The characters are real and down to earth- believeable. There is much anticipation for Carol from one moment to the next to get closer to solving who and why the teacher was killed.
0, Check the video requirements: I would have liked to play this game
0, Unstable and Boring: After just recently finishing Myst III Exile
1, The Real System Requirements: The requirements that Amazon is listing are incorrect. Here are the correct requirements taken from the Ubisoft support site.In order to play this game properly
0, Worthless box: This has to be the most boring and worthless game I have ever purchased. Looking at the box is more entertaining than playing the game. You can walk through fence but still be on the other side
0, Useless: My review may change
0, Awful: I've loved this show for so long but they changed showrunners and it shows. Full of plot holes
0, sorry: This was a very poor showing of a show opening. I'm beginning yo wonder if Sam left his soul back in the mirror in Lawerence. If anything
1, Fun Series: What a fun series -- well shot
1, awesome supernatural: I really enjoyed supernatural! Great product
1, super natural: Got this as soon as it released for my sons birthday. Him & his friends love this series. Im sure the hope there continue to be future seasons
1, Supernatural: I was so happy when I got my order. The package was fully intact. There was no damage at all! Very pleased!
0, Uninspiring book about an uninspring person: I just sold my copy. Found the book a little boring. I bought it since I have met Larry awhile back. But mid-way in the book I got the feeling that his values are just so incongruent with mine that I didn't feel it necessary to finish the book. The jury is out whether Oracle succeeded because of him or despite him.
0, Noth worth the money: This book is way over-priced for the level of information it offers. Just from browsing through the lab scenarios
0," A good review tool.: This ""book"" is nothing of the sort. It is a collection of test questions and practice labs. The questions in general are not as specific as the questions on the real CCIE test. What this is"
1, Amazing: One of my favorite movies. Despair
1," Comparable to ""Five Easy Pieces""...: ...in its theme of drifter/womanizer"
1, Not my favorite episode
1, awesome!!!: I am so pleased with my order. I am a huge Smallville fan and was pleased to finish my collection so quickly and easily. The price was more than half that of most stores. Package was still in plastic and brand new. Another happy Amazon customer!
0, One more season
1, 10TH SEASON OF SMALLVILLE: I LOVED THE SMALLVILLE SERIES AND WAS GLAD TO HAVE RECEIVED THE 10TH SEASON SO VERY QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THANK YOU.
0, Not impressed
0, Just say no to Hoover: I previously had a Hoover Savvy but I ran over something which triggered the automatic shut off and it hasn't worked since. It lasted for about a year and a half which I think for $180.00 should have lasted a lot longer. Second time around I bought the less expensive Hoover Empower. Despite the fact that the Savvy only lasted a short while I was happy with it up until then so I figured if I bought the Empower for 99.00 I wouldn't be so upset if it broke down in 1 1/2 years. The Empower has now broken down after 5 months. The bare floor function never worked
0, Sooo Disappointing! No longevity: I bought this about a year ago from Target. It's now completely broken.I live in a small one bed-room apartment. With a couple rugs to clean and one dog (not to clean! obviously).Pieces have literally broken off underneath it. Starting at the 6 month point.I am so disappointed that it didn't last very long. Vacuums Should have more longevity
1, Plumb Rocks!!: When it comes to veterinary drugs
0, Retire Lucky!!!!!: Very disappointed. Lucky has become an unbelievable character. Jackie Collins should reitre the whole Lucky Santangelo series.
0, Avoid IN THE MOOD INTIMATES at all costs !!: This seller
0," it's not a dual ""pc"" monitor card"
1, Hard Times is Good time of Entertainment: Not your classic action movie. More of a drama. But there's plenty of action to see. That's what makes it so good to see. You get a good plot
1, Charles Bronson fan: If a certain movie star has an appeal
1, hard times in australia: I was lucky enough to see this movie one night ten years ago and i have never seen a better fight movie or movie ever for that matter
0, Great films
1, mafioso: missions in this game are fun but the graphics lack a bit. the cars are realistic and the music is great to listen to in free ride.
1, AWSOME!: This game is spectacular i had it for pc and it was great.The enviroment of Lost Heaven is so detailed.The missons are filled with gun shootouts! and alot of explosions.I reccomend that anyone who is upsessed with Mafia History should get this game!
1, NEOVA Purifying Facial Cleanser 8 OZ: This cleanser was prescribed to me by my dermatologist.It's great. Just rinse off with warm water and follow it by COLD WATER.It cleanses deep and there's no soap residue as when one washes with soaps.And this is the reason why he recommended this product. He said it will not clog pores.I'm very satisfied with it.HINT:BEST to buy it OUT of the Dermatologist officeas in Amazon.He charged me way tgoo much! until I found it here in Amazon at GREAT prices!
1, A mature
0, the worst book ever written by a human: who is he writing for? Scientists?No because a school boy will have more knowledge of science than him
1, A remarkable look at the physiological basis of religion
1, fantastic: i have to admit that
0, Box says 1kb 2.2lbs but it's really 800grams or 2lbs. Plus it's made in china.: I'm sorry don't trust stuff made in china to prepare my food. Maybe they shouldn't have put lead in kids toys.
1, Fun to Frolick in Anarctica!: Clarissa's adventures are fun and funny--I laughed out loud several times. My favorite Clarissa moment was when
1, Worth watching but flawed: I had seen a few clips on Youtube and awaited with great anticipation the release of this film. The beginning is the best section
0, bad quality: the cover i recieved is bad quality and there is no brand label or anything wroted on the cover to show the brand mark(box wave)and thank you
0, Disappointing: Anybody who's ever heard this author on This American Life would have high hopes for any novel he writes
0, Dreadful: I bought this book with high hopes. I am fascinated both with science (especially neuroscience) and with spirituality (especially Eastern). This book promised to bring togetehr these two subjects in a novel concordance.Sadly
0, D'ont read unless you like crass: I cannot believe that someone as foul mouthed as this author was ever picked up to serve as a policeman. No wonder he turned bad. NYPD must have been desperate. The vocabulary is shockingly filthy and I could not finish the book. buyer beware.
1, WinME is a lot better than it is given credit for: I must respectfully disagree with the editor's comments on this release. As long as your hardware is fairly recent
0, Time to get an upgrade: When I first got Windows Me in December 2000
1, Performances make the movie: As far as plot goes
0, wrong turn indeed by anthony m jones: Antoher movie about canibles what a waste of time
0, An absolute disgrace.: Leave it to the people in Hollywood who have never so much as set foot in West Virginia to make a movie set in the state. I thought stereotypes were a BAD thing in the politically correct times of 2004
0, Ridiculous anti rural hate propaganda: Why two stars? Because it was so completely off that it at least made me laugh. I've been to West Virginia and only about .01% of the population fit this stereotype (and to a far lesser degree...no sasquash there). Of course
1, GREAT HORROR MOVIE: BEST HORROR MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT THE WHOLE TIME. THE ACTING WAS GREAT.DON'T KNOW WHY SOME PEOLE GAVE IT ONE OR TWO STARS I GUESS THEY DON'T KNOW A GOOD MOVIE WHEN THEY SEE ONE
0, If not for Dushku.....: ...the film would lack any redemption. Implausible. unpredictable only in the sense that most people can't imagine anyone getting paid for scripting such stupidity. we naturally expect more. we're usually disappointed. 'Wrong turn' doesn't fail to disappoint or insult a post-95 IQ. Eliza looks great
1, Upbeat and catchy: Hot Show has got to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. It's full of catchy songs that will stick in your head for days. I
1," Konnie's Review: I really really love this CD! I first heard the songs ""Sucks to be you"" and ""Strange Disease"" like a few years ago and I loved them so much. I found out who the band was and rushed to the store to get their CD. I listen to the Cdall the time and sing along with it.There is only one song I don't like and that is 'I like to watch(Milo's night out)'becuz I think it's very rude"
1, long handles: Pleased with the spoons although the handles are long so you have to be careful that you don't bump them especially if you have it in the pan. I would be careful around small kids.
0, Business Plan Maker: I was very happy to receive this business plan maker in a very timely fashion. However
0, Don't buy the Kindle version: Although the story is a very nice one
0, still waiting: I know my son will love it when he finally gets his Christmas present
0, Mike and the Bots had a down day.: Disappointing. MST3000 works on two levels--the movie itself
1, Surprisingly Inspirational: This is a great book if you're looking for ideas for different or interesting desserts. It does a great job of leading you through the construction of very impressive desserts. I loved the sections on garnishes. Everything I've made from this book has looked and tasted great
0, I wanted to like this but...: I didn't. The story seemed interesting
0, bad picture: I saw this movie as a young child only once and thought it pretty scary. When I saw it was being released on DVD I was on the edge as to by it or not. I watched on HULUand thought the picture was worth getting.What I got was very muddy
0, Leather comes away from the soul: Hate to be the bearer of bad news
1, Good Quality: These spoons are heavy duty and good quality. They stand up to being left inside a pot while it's on the stove. My only complaint is that the color is pink and not red. My husband definitely made a comment about this and said he won't be using these. Other than the color being misrepresented
1, Awesome spoons!: These are a great addition to your kitchen for those of you who LOVE red
0, Wasted money
1, Good for retail: I gave the tests to the managers in my store and showed how each of us had different working personalities and what we needed to do to be able to work togther better.
0, Poor Illustrations: I have used this book and video in my music classes for years. After retiring
0, not accurate? NOT EVEN APPROXIMATE!!: Some days this scale will read the same WHATEVER you put on it.I can step on it with or without shoes
0, Marginal: I bought this for myself when it was on sale. It did not meet my expectations - much less 'elegant' than it looked in the photo.
0, Too much talking: I got so tired of hearing Lilia talk and bored waiting for the yoga to begin I have quit using the DVD. If she had simply shown how to do the movement
1, Keyboard/Wrist Pad: I though I could find something like this at the local Staples or Office Depot
0, this book really stinks: I really didn't think this book helped at all. I thought that it was a walk through telling you how to beat the game but it just tells you some things.
0," Will NOT fit stock 79 CJ7s: The add says it will fit stock CJs - with modification required if there is factory AC. NOT THE WHOLE STORY! It turns out it also needs significant modification with stock heater/air plenum in the 79 CJ7. Called seller & they said I would have to cut the enclosure (it's sealed) to fit. I'm certain that if I do that I will get whistles and other issues once the speakers start to move in the enclosure. I'm going with just the ""Mod Pod"" under-door enclosures (same manufacturer) and live with whatever sound I get from those. I returned the Centra Pods."
0, Outdated: I bought both this one and the new one and I have to agree with the reviewers above who say that the new dictionary is far more reliable
1, Model Railroading in Small Spaces: This is an excellent overview of what is involved with setting up and running a layout in limited space. The author gives plenty of options and details of what is involved without preaching. I've read seven books on the topic and this was by far the easiest reading.
0, Undressing Infidelity - Not: I was looking for more of an analytical approach to infidelity. This book was based on anecdotal evidence. Women gossiping about their sexual indiscretions. Written in the style of a cheap erotica I feel this book will attract a more feminine audience. I was hoping for the author to dissect each interview in an anthropological fashion. This book has nothing to do with with undressing infidelity. Making a book out of interviews with no research or commentaries makes it hard to believe the author put any effort into writing this book. This book belongs in the soft erotica section at best.
1, A fantastic tour-de-force: This book has ambitious scope and it fully carries it. It is well written
0," Another mediocre occult book: Beware...this book may not be what you're looking for. Its awkwardly used first person style is tedious with many overly long run-on sentences. Liberally laced with four letter words I quickly discovered it's not another end times thriller from a Christian perspective. The author's world view is summed up in his author's note: ""....we are all worshipping the same God without realizing it..."" It led to a story that was disappointing."
1, Phenomenal book: If you climb in Southern Ca.
1, This wrench set is awesome!: A coworker of mine had the Gearwrench set for a few months and after tiring of walking down to his space to borrow them
1, Great melodic metal: Although Oceanborn was trully better than this album
1, nightwish rocks: I personally like angels fall first. I think it has some great songs. What Nightwish fan doesn't love elvenpath and beauty and the beast. I was also blown away by the carpenter and astral romance. This album is a must have for any nightwish fan.
1, Good start but not perfect: I'm going to keep this short and sweet
1, A GIFT for my Wife!: I'm not really the Best person to review this dvd set since it was bought as a gift.I have watched this show and do agree with my Wife that it does show Good wholesome family values. It is also one of her Favorite shows to watch.Personally I prefer other genres
1, Little House on the Praire - The Complete Season 3: Packaging was great and it arrived on time. 12 more words ok one two three four five six seven eight
1, LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRIARIE: MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN READING THE SERIES BOOKS SO I WANTED HERTO SEE THE TV SERIES. SHE LOVES THEM AS MUCH AS I DID.
1, Every bit as good as The Toxic Avenger: I have seen this film many times and never get tired of it. I would mention the plot
1," The 4 ""R'S"" Reading"
0, Sick
1, Awesomely bad!: Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!
1, Great Classic: If you have seen the movies or know the story
1, Good Book: This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it. She has got couple more books of this author. She said this book did a lot of justice for some serious reading.
1, Wilde: Wilde could have made things a lot more unpleasant for Grey. I suppose a sinner being triumphant in life was part of the theme. Nonetheless
1, No movie can match the beauty of the original book: If you didn't read this book
0, Dorian Gray: The characters were at times insufferable which is the point. I would have liked more detail of Gray's adventures which were almost entirely left to the imagination. Ending came too quick for me.
1, Classic: I love this story. It is full of meaning and lessons. I recenly re-read it for about the tenth time and enjoyed it as much now as when I was a youngster - decades ago. I highly recommend this classic book.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth
0, Rewarding but tedious: For me
0, A book about sin and corruption...: which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No
1, Another edition of the timeless book: I ordered the book having read it already
1, One of the Best: After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it
0, Oh Dear: I'm reading this for Book Club and I try not to put it down -- because I'm afraid I won't pick it up again! While I see how good the story is
1, One of my Favorites!: This is really a must read
1, Still One of My All Time Favorites!: This book has always been one of my favorites and that hasn't changed. I love it! Such a compelling story.
0, Pardon me
0, Probably Not for Die Hards: I have to say listening to this Album was pretty much torture. The music itself
1, Heart Throbbing: Love is strong. It is the tie that binds two hearts together. Noah and Andrea were connected by that tie until her sudden death. Follow Noah as he careens through the dangerous streets of Atlanta
0, How do they choose Sundance Official Selections?: Is it Sundance
1, hot stuff: I bought this because i did not want fires on my deck burning the wood this is great little fire pit .burns low or high just right for enjoying cool nights
1, Great Sock: My Five Finger KSOs were a tad bit too big
0," Fit and Quality Just ""OK"": The largest size I've ever worn is 8M (stilettos"
0, not for big feet over 12 inches: i have a size 12 foot
1, Favorite socks.: I specifically bough these for use with some Vibram Five Fingers shoes and now I wear them all the time. They are just the right thickness that they don't mess up the feel of the Vibram shoes
0, weak seams: While these socks are very comfortable and work great with the barefoot running style of she
1, as advertised: They came as expected
1, Perfect fit with my Vibram Bikila LS shoes: I was on the fence about which size of sock to order
0, Everything about this sock is bad.: The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not. I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing. These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore). I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.
1, Celebrate toe independence!: I almost always run in Vibrams with no socks. But when I hit a rugged trail
1, YOGA 101 WORKOUT / DAILY ROUTINES FOR BEGINNERS: Lilia has been around for decades. She used to be on PBS in Boston during the 60s when I was a little girl & I used to watch her. I'm very pleased with the program & she explains everything very clearly. I'm still on the 1st dvd. when I master this I'll move on to the next one. This is worth the money & it's reasonably priced. I'm looking forward to purchasing her other dvds.
1, Great tool: The Motion Pro tire iron are awesome. I never changed a tire and go tired of paying a lot of money to the dealerships. So I did some research and found out that it isn't hard at all to change a tire on my own. I heard a lot of good things about the motion pro tire iron and was looking for a great deal
1," Interesting look at homelessness: Less a ""romance of freighthopping"" and more just vignettes of homelessness in various places. Ted's writing was a good match for his subject matter. Ted mentioned that one of the reasons for the demise of hoboing was the prosperity of the '90s. That situation is being reversed...Go to Northbank Fred's website for some of the adventure."
1, Bad Monkey is good: I am not a serious guitar player. What I mean is I don't get paid to play. But I do like the sounds I can make with this pedal and the distortion pedal I previously purchased. I am thankful they are relatively inexpensive and clearly built to last. I would certainly buy another one from either Amazon or DigiTech. It was a worthy purchase for me.
1, Love Lisa Wingate: This series is my introduction to Lisa Wingate and Over the Moon is the third book. I'm totally hooked on her writing and Over the Moon was a perfect wrap up of the characters -- I hope she is going to do more Texas Hill Country
0," Transparent: I found the plot of ""Ragtime in Simla"" to be fairly obvious very early in the book. In addition"
1," Twists and turns: ""Ragtime in Simla"" is the third Barbara Cleverly mystery I've read"
1, Always enjoyable: AS before
1, twilight saga: i really enjoyed this twilight saga breaking dawn part 1 was very good not what i expected but very good and exciting and interesting for young or old alike
1, Twilight Part IV.: Excellent movie
0," Worse evening in a long time: This movie wasn't workth the effort it took to push the remote ""play"" button. I've never seen much worse than this one."
1, Twlight - Breaking Dawn: Purchased this product for my daughter as she did not have this particular movie and we needed to add to her Twilight Collection
1, I liked it: I've seen it a lot of times. As a filmmaker
0, pointless: Most of these films have been somewhat entertaining but I have to wonder what the point of splitting this book into two parts could have been
1," T-BD 1 Oh Yeah :): Just saw the trailer for Twilight Breaking Dawn part One and I am blown away already....serious creepy stuff and major ""wedding night"" scene give away!!! I cannot wait for this to open..everyone who is a fan of this wonderful series will nominate Stephenie Meyer for Sainthood....please watch it"
0, not as good as the others...: This one was not nearly as good or innocent as the others. Kind of a dark dtheme and way too much sexual content for kids.
1, love it: good
0," Breaking *YAWN*: This must be one of the worst of the movie series. The movie needs to be renamed ""Breaking Yawn"". Go watch Kristen Stewart in Wonderland instead. Her performance was amazing in that much better movie."
0, Terrible movie that makes everybody fall asleep: I regretted spending money and time to watch this lousy movie. Better off taking a nap than wasting time on this
0, Sucked!!!!: This movie regressed back to what the first movie was with a sappy
0, Terrible!: Boring
0, Why do we keep going to these films?: I have no clue why I let the hype get to me to watch this. Ugggh!!! The Book is sooooooooooooooooooo much better. Why are people buying this?
1, Started out slow: So I've really enjoyed all the books & the movies up til this one. The first half of this movie was a bit boring. But since I've invested so much time with the series & the prior movies I wasn't going to give up. I continued to watch & it did eventually pick up speed. CANNOT wait for part 2.Sidenote: If you haven't read any of the books or watched any of the earlier movies
1, LOVED IT: This was the best movie ever!!!Loved it
0, What a waste of money: I got the box today
0, just bad: This movie was the worst of all the twilight movies. there was no appealing aspects of this movie what so ever. dont let your GF talk you into this one.
1, Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1: Not quite as good as the first three movies! It still was wotrh watching as my wife and I have watched the others at least six times each.
0, Oh my eyes...: witness such a tragedy!Saddens me to see such monstrosities released on DVD!Oh but it horrifies me to see it on Blu-ray!To see Bella's stone face in HD is like running into a tree!To see Edward's sparkling chest truly scrambles one's brain into a mess!Such overrated trash is not meant to be seen
0, Deserves 0 stars.: Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies. Can't wait for them to end.
0, Don't waste your time.: The cardboard male and female are back...and still can't act. The only thing interesting are the werewolves...and the non-leading vampires.
0, Not good.: C'mon vamps that walk in the light? So stupid. oh and they sparkle too. Acting is horrible. Amazing what people like nowadays.
0, Very Disappointed!: I started watching the movie on my computer and after about 30 minutes
1, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1: Now that what I'm taking about
0, Will give you nothing but headache: I thought I could create some nice slide presetnations. This software is very unfriendly. Hard to figure out even with the users manual. The instructions doesn't work and not explanatory. Will give you nothing but headache. I was unable to make any slide presentation. Zip. Nada.
1, Tremendous Pacing....: Easily one of the top true crime books I have ever read. Corwin has an eye for detail but doesn't get bogged down in minutia or wordiness. The pacing of the investigations lead to many
0, Trite: Trite
1, Finally
0, Disappointed: The worst of the Deryini novels by far. I hate to give one of Ms. Kurtz's Deryini novels a bad review because her work has given me great pleasure over the years
1, Great Hardcore Album from Great People: This is a great CD from the band Stars Are Falling
1, hi-Lift jack base: Upon receiving this extended base
1, Works as intended.: Not much to say other than it does what it is supposed to do. I have used it a couple of times when I was stuck in the sand and it worked.
1, Finding Soul: Finding Soul on the path of Orisa is truly one of the great books available on the market today. Out of all the books written about Traditional African Religion available
0, not as good as other cho-pat: I have the original cho-pat
0, Not worth the effort: This book is billed as a suspenseful novel about Lizzie Borden. The only suspense I felt was in trying to stay awake. The book was incredibly boring
1, at the scence of the crime: i read the lizzie borden book and i felt like i was there b/c it kept u off the edge of ur seat and never let u off any other detail it always had u there and let you feel like u weere bridget or whoever and i felt that way i recommned this book becasue it is a good book if u like crimes but i dont like killing and i still liked so but it is all about this girl that hated her parents and they were rich and wealthy but were cheap and they always ate mutton like old sheep so then lizzie decided to kill her parents when she does she tells every1 else that she didnt do it like anyother crimneal would and then in the end she gets caught goes to jail and now the house they are living in is a bed and brakfast bye bye bye and i hope this helped out people
1, The Strokes - Juicebox/Hawaii Single: Really good. Includes 2 tracks (Juicebox
1, Easy Workout!: This is a great workout DVD! The steps are easy to follow and it will leave you sweating by the end of the workout. I would recommend doing a lot of stretching of the mid-section before trying this
0, AMAZON SENT ME A BOOTLEG COPY: So I ordered this with tahitian cardio
1, great book!: This is yet another hit from Christopher Hart. It has easy-to- follow drawings and a sense of humor. He takes you step by step to each character type and pose. Well worth the money.
1, A compelling coming-of-age and immigration story: This is an interesting look at the hurdles a young girl faces in New York City in the 40s and 50s. Not only does she come to terms with who her parents are as Caribbean immigrants
1, So far so good: This was a perfect replacement for my factory rotors. The anti-rust coating seems like it will last for a while
1, accurate: This gun was given to me and it leaked air pressure so I sent it to Daisy and for $28 plus $6 for s&h they put in new seals and valve and now I really enjoy it. It only chronys out at 386 fps but just right at 10 yards. DO NOT pump it more than once as it is a single pump design and over pumping will take out the seals. The trigger has a very good feel to it with nearly zero creep and the fully adjustable rear sight is a plus
0, carry compass all the time if you plan to use this: if you try to get driving directions using this software
1, This is essential!: What a wonderful little book. Clearly written with the appropriate amount of biography and historical reference. Excellent plates of many of Magritte's important works that represent his career from start to finish. In less than 30 minutes
0," Misleading: Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an ""enriched classic"" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so"
1, More fun than a barrel of monkeys!: This is also my first automatic ice cream freezer
0, krup not worth the money: DO NOT recommend too much trouble...must freeze bowl in order to make a very small amount of cream. Has to be frozen 24 hours prior to making cream. Can only make one making then must refreeze for at least 24 hours. Can not just spontanously make ice cream when you would like.
1, I love it!!: I love this ice cream maker. It takes about 45 minutes & you have ice cream! Great way to end the evening after having a nice dinner.
0, worthless art: This hummingbird feeder either drips constantly(new from the box
1, An indispensible text for serious practioners: This is not a how-to
1, Funny and Witty: I must admit that I had reservations about whether or not I would enjoy this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by its humor and wit
0, Cute: It was slow
0," Star Wattage Blows a Fuse: ""Alex and Emma"" proves once again that without a good script"
0, The poor reviews are right!: This was a choppy story with no romance. It seemed to employ about every formula joke and situation for such a romantic comedy
0, A Shame for Both Actors!: I was so excited about seeing this movie
1, So sweet!: Ok
0," Three out of one and more coming: I first saw this on an international flight quite a few years ago and found it quite entertaining for the captive audience. Now I find it has been split up into several ""sequels"" that seem to have lost something along the way. I'm not going to bother with the next one ""Princess on an Elephant Hunt""."
0, NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!!: Me and my mom were exited to see this movie at first but as we got farther into the movie we sooner or later left.It was such a shock that the price turned out to only be interested in topless girls And even asks one the girls in a bar to take her shirt off for him.Me and my mom bursted out of the theater and got her money back.Me and my mom had thought we had just veiwed half of a PG-13.if you think this movie would be cute for your daughter at her b-day or just a great family movie
0, the prince and me turns out to be a royal pain.: Far from anything new
0, Inside Daisy Clover: WAIT... I love this movie.. A great glimps into old Hollywood and Natalie Wood was never more adorable. HOWEVER
1, They're GRRRREAT!: These noodles are almost a carbon copy of a snack that we ate while on holiday in Hawaii. They make a chicken stock with chunks of chicken
0," well-written self-indulgent tripe: This book is genuinely mean-spirited. The author is full of her ""poor little gorgeous me"" self-pity"
0, This book was not quite as advertised...: It says the book is targeted for ages 3-10
1, Siegmund Nimsgern-yet another superb performance: An all-star cast
1, Professor Noggin's Card Game - History: This is an excellent fun way to help with your kids education. Mine love playing. From my 5 year old to my 15 year old. We do change the rules a little bit to allow all of them to play together.
1," Swing! Swing! Swing!: Excellent album! Tracks mostly from 1950's release ""Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra"" are arranged by George Siravo and Axel Stordahl. ""I've Got a Crush on You"" is my favourite. This album really swings!"
1, Excellent!: These short comics are just as I remembered them as a young boy. This is so great how they can reproduce some things lost in childhood. I suggest to pass these great
1, A nostalgic animation treasure!: Here it is! ...With all the lasers
1, Jonny Quest-The complete first season: Wow! This box set was worth waiting for. The classic animation series looks and sounds better then a lot of the animation series produced today. The special features are great. The excitement of Brad Bird and the others is clearly evident and you can feel it with them as they guide us through some of the reasons why Jonny Quest may have been the best animated series of all time. This DVD set is a must have for anyone interested in animation.
1, amazon advnture: Now my kids can enjoy what I did
1, it's OK: As my favourite cartoon is JQ
1, $18.95 is $3.60 per jar: There are three online retailers for Ball brand canning jars. They all charge shipping so that the jars cost at least $2.50 each. Leifheit jars are the only ones sold by Amazon. These are squat and good for pickled food instead of for sweet tea. The shape does make it easier to hold.
1, The title says it all: Whether you want to improve your awareness
1, The Breast cancer survival manual: This book has helped me in my treatment choices. I love the lay out and the real world information. Not scary just the facts no hearts and flowers. I have only just begun my battle with breast cancer. But this book lives in my bag that goes with me every where
1, A very helpful book: This book was very informative after I was diagnosed with cancer of the breast. It describes in detail the types of cancer infiltrating the breast tissue and steps needed for treatment. Also recommended diet and exercise is included. This book is a must when dealing with this disease.
0, Second Nature: Nothing about gardening like I had expected. It was more about his like gardening in different places where he lived
0, Pollans least interesting work: I have read most of Michael Pollans books. I think 'The Omnivores Dilemma' is a five-star plus book that should be mandatory reading for everyone who eats
0, Worked too well: I went completely numb and was unable to keep it up. It was embarrassing. Also
0, Not for every one: It does what it is supposed to do
0, The Worst: Just an old guy telling stories with images/scenes that have NOTHING to do with what he is talking about. Long
0, BORING BORING BORING!!!: This film is the dullest one I've seen in many a moon. This old goat simply recites early Biblical stories
0, Genesis - a nomad's tale: I completely agree with McNamara's review. This is more a narrative with pictures than a dramatic film. For dramatization
1, I really liked this book...: This is the first novel I have read by Coulter and look forward to reading some more of hers. If some say this is not one of her best
1, Great addition to the F.B.I. series: Great read! The hero is handsome
0, Ludicrous.: This book is truly unbelievable. None of the characters are even remotely realistic. A federal judge who finds a child in the woods
0, Blu-ray Version Is Terrible: I'm not going to go into the plot of these two movies from the xxxHolic and Tsubasa series
1, Excellent performance - outstanding price: Outstanding performance at a price far below the big names. They're a bit heavy but you must expect that with 56mm lenses.
1, Profound Talent!: The Bolshoi is awesome. Their front man
1, Claude Raines was spectacular!: Even though we don't see him till the very last scene
1, The quality is quite visible: A maverick researcher (Claude Rains) uses an invisibility drug on himself
1, Great old flick: If you don't read the credits
0, Horrendous Picture and Sound Quality: I love the KOMMISSAR X movies and was eagerly awaiting the DVD. Unfortunately
1, Lawrence's Spiritual Journey: One gets the impression that D.H. Lawrence's visit to Mexico in the 1920's was quite difficult; Mexico was rocked by political and social violence and even extremes of climate. Yet somehow
0, worth a look: Although one hesitates to give any book by D. H. Lawrence two stars
0, Dismal: I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico. If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life
1, Good introduction to lesser known mythologies: This is a good set of stories about Erik's voyages and adventures. Oral traditions of these stories are blatenly obvious
0, Its really about common sense: This book was a waste of time to read. It comes down to this
1, Excellent book for the business manager: This book is an excellent brief on the business application for project management and the value selection for a project as applied to the business perspective. This book is on my list of favorite recommendations to non-project managers and business application managers struggling to understand the value that project management offers an organization. It also provides incite on how project selection supports a business case
1, Absolute game changer!!!!: As I read through a few of the reviews one comment seemed to stand out amongst the rest. Someone said
1, One among two: If I only had two books to live by it would be the Bible and the Guide to Rational Living.I have read and re-read. This book I have used faithfully since the early 60's and it is more revealing today than ever.
1, Suburban View: What a great CD! A very diverse mix of songs...a little Pop
0, Flawed and misguided.: I had the unfortunate requirement to read this book in a criminology course. Between third person references
0, NICE ILLUSTRATIONS
1, Like the book very much 
1, These work well: These lights work well - especially for the money. But be careful when mounting because the housing is very thin
1, Great cd.: Great price
1, Finally!: This set will have the new to DVD movies HIGH ANXIETY
0, How Could They?...: How could Fox release this as a stand alone set only. They must release The Twelve Chairs as a separate entry. It is a minor masterpiece but to pay such a steep price for the set is something that I certainly will not do.
0, What a Sham!: I'm glad that Fox is finally putting Robin Hood: Men in Tights on DVD. But they must be nuts thinking I'm gonna spend $70 for a whole set of movies if I only want the one. That is just ridiculous!
1, Funny but dated!: I lovd this movie when it came out in the 70's......it was enjoyable to see again
1, Mel Brooks Classics: If you remember what satire was like before political correctness demolished good humor
1, Now available on DVD in the UK!!: Very happy to say that this great
0," Ridiculous packaging YET AGAIN: Considering the fact that most people who would buy this in the first place are 99% of the time using appropriate storage means ie. a movie/book case or shelving that accommodates a ""COLLECTION""... I find it outrageously annoying that YET AGAIN we are offered a collection of movies using packaging that cannot possibly fit IN said storage facilty. I LOVE Mel Brooks films. LOVE them! But I REFUSE to purchase this set becuase I am sick of trying to stuff stupidly packaged Blu-ray sets in places other than where my ""COLLECTION"" goes! Grrrrr! Knock it off with the stupidity! THINK OF THE COLLECTORS.... please note the term COLLECTOR alluding to collecTION alluding to STORAGE. Release the *#$@ movies separately and I will buy my favorites. But I'll chew glass before I buy one more stupidly packaged movie set!!!"
1," Complete Collection: Love Mel Brooks comedy. Now I have it on demand in highest quality possible. Great buy. Wish the packaging was little more ""collectible"". Just kind of a flmsy cardboard sleeve."
1, Best collection!: This DVD collection is hilarious! It was a lot cheaper buying it here on Amazon than at the big box store!!
1, Hitchcock 'Owned': Sure it's over-the-top but it's also very good. There isn't a weak spot in the cast. The psychopathic killer is a personal favorite. Try to find all the Hitchcock film references. This movie won't disappoint.
0, Dull: The plot was kind of trite
0, Not as good as the old series. Disappointed.: The Sweet Valley High books written in the 80's were very clever and the characters and stories were interesting and had depth. Now these have been re-written to reflect the current times but I notice the twins talk like airheads now in this new version and the story and characters in general have declined in quality. Its one thing to re-work sweet valley into modern times but did they have to change what we loved about the characters? I wish they had kept everything the same and only changed the names of places and objects (such as letting the twins have cell phones now and etc.) instead of changing the characters themselves.
1, Joe Walsh saved the Eagles: The Fairwell 1 Tour is an excellent quality concert video. All of the popular hit songs are on it. The Eagles sound better now then they did when the songs were hits on the music charts. Joe Walsh is simply outstanding
1, Wow: I have been very disappointed with the HD video side of many movies
1, Great Video and Audio and Great song's list: I got this Eagles HD-DVD yesterday. It was a awesome transfer. The video quality is very very good. The sound is a reference quality. The highs and lows are perfectly captured. I have a HK receiver and Bose system. The selection of songs for this event are very good. Lots of songs
1, (The Eagles Farewell 1 Tour) Simply Fantastic and Fun!!: After seeing them live in March 2005 I thought that was it. Seeing them and hearing them live was truly like being in the recording studio with them!The new release from Melbourne
1, WOW what a concert!!!!!!!!!: It has to be one of the best music DVD'S I have!!! If you like the Eagles
0, displeased: My first order of the dvd proved to be blank
1, Highest quality available: This is an outstanding concert video. Sound is excellent with DTS and the wide screen video is a rarity. This is easliy the best music DVD I own. Outstanding show
1," Video-WOW Audio...: I'll give this DVD set an A+ for video. DTS is C- (minus). Sounds ""brittle"" to me. I like their previous release better.Edit: I'm glad to see others supporting the brittleness of the sound."
0, ? good sound: The info on Amazon did not state this album only plays in stereo and DTS 5.1
1, Fantastic: This is an exceptional DVD. All the great Eagles songs and more are in there. This 2 DVD set is more than 2 hours long. There is much more included over the television broadcast
1," EAGLES FAREWELL TOUR VIDEO: ""OUTRAGEOUS"" JUST INVITE THE BOYS INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM AND JAM...AWESOME;-)"
1," Just like being at the concert: Played on our 38"" flat screen with the surround sound turned way up"
1, The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour: I really enjoyed this DVD. The Eagles have produced some of the greatest music ever recorded. One of the new songs on this DVD
0, Did not work: I bought this specifcally because it said HD DVD. It was a gift for my mother and she owns a HD dvd player. It not only did not work in the HD DVD but on none of the other 5 DVD players we tried.
0, The DVD is blank: This DVD had no data on the disc. We did not open the package for over two months from the time it arrived. We did not know it was blank until I attempted to play it. We tried it on two DVD players that are otherwise working fine and then tried it on a dvd player in our computer.I previously rated the transactions as a 5 star because of the quick delivery. However I need to change that to a 1 star minus due to the missing data on the disc.Hoping for a replacement but navigating thru the return options is difficult.
1," Best All American Band: The ""Eagles"" are an all American band with exceptional talent. They combind rock and country music where they have written all the songs and produced the ""farewell"" concert showing the talent of each individual band member."
0, returned this item: I returned this item because I did not realize that the HD DVD format would not play on my blueray player. I noticed later when I reordered that this item was no longer available and carried a big warning message. I have since reordered the regular DVD vesion and am happy with it. I hope I got credit for my return!
1, Total Perfection: If you like the Eagles you will LOVE this concert and interview footage. On a 5.1 surround system it's just like being there. Remember how good they were 25-30 years ago? I swear they are even better NOW. As close to perfect as a group can get. Buy this DVD set and treasure it.
0, poor streaming quality
1, Good
1, Wide Open Ending: The mini-series/movie was really good. I thought that it was a typo when I saw how long it is. It is that long
1, Interesting: This movie was very entertaining and smart. It was interesting how they fit fairy tales into everyday life. John Laroquette was hilarious. After about two parts
0, For God Sake Man
1, Good fun even seeing it years later: I remember loving this movie as a kid when it first came out. Rewatching it more recently
1, OMFG: I have to say that this is the best movie i have ever watched. The plot twists are intriguing and i never got bored. good for anyone
1, One of my favorite films: I like this film a great deal. It's funny
1, The 10th Kingdom: This is the the best fantasy/drama/action movie I have ever seen. It lives up
0, Good movies but be careful about the DVD version: I' ve seen this movies many times on video tape when I decided to get the DVD version. I found that disc B scene 13-18 were all wrong
0, Wretched Tripe: I love fairy tales. When I first heard the concept of this movie
0, What was Hallmark thinking?: This movie is so scattered and is unworthy of the Hallmark name which is the reason I bought it.
1, Wonderful Entertainment for all agens: This film is one of the best I have seen in years! My entire family
1, A Fairytale for the Young at Heart: The 10th Kingdom does what great fairytales always do... weaves us into a world of magic where romance blossoms and the bad guys always get what they deserve
1, I Loved it!: I absolutely loved this movie. The characters were so intense. I related to each and everyone of them in one way or another. The love story between Virginia and Wolfe was my favorite. I hope there will be a second part to this movie. I want to see what happens to the two lovers.
1," I too: I've also been waiting a very long time for this to come out on DVD. Don't know why it hasn't. Will buy it in a heartbeat. That and the 1980 version of ""Flash Gordon"" with Sam Jones (I know"
1, Mel Brooks Best: This is
1, Great Spiritual Journey: If you are searching for your own spiritual center and want a book that documents someone else's journey to inspire you
1, Good
0, Great......at first.....: I received my monsoon planar 9 speakers as a gift. I absolutely loved them. I listened to them for almost two years
1, AWESOME SWEETNESS: Walter Payton was the model of what every player should be like
1," finally a "" 68 "": My husband has a 1968 elcamino and I have looked for over a year to find it in a toy car. I wish there was a car model to put together too. He was really suprised when I gave it to him."
0, WASTE OF MONEY: This book is a complete waste of money as it shows NONE of the changes to the content
0, Not a Good Gift...: I bought this as a gift for a floutist friend. Unfortunately
1, Pretty good selection: This is good if you're looking for something different. Lots of songs from the same thing (Oliver
0, Internal deodorant: I purchased this item over a month ago. This ihas done absolutely nothing for me. No need to purchase again.
0, Wanted it to work so bad
1," LOVE IT.: I also saw this on PBS. Loved it from the first day I saw it and will still love it for a very long time. I play it on my 50"" plasma and it looks great. Kids love it (4 and 2) and parents love it too.I put it on as background video/music"
1," to get the facts: For the best non-fiction account of the Anglo-Egyptian/Sudanese war of 1897-98 read Winston Churchill's ""The River War"". The future prime minister was a 25 year old cavalry lieutenant in the 21st Lancers. Hard to get but worth the effort."
0, butchered version of a great classic: This book is NOT Four Feathers. It may be Two and one half feathers. It is mercilessly abridged
1, Good read: A touchy freely Christmas story. Predictable but still a pleasant read! I recommend it but I would not buy it. A good free read.
1, Really har to put down: I found this easy to read
1, santa shop: good book to read if you want an uplifting story at bad time in your life or just to make you feel good
0, too small: Ordered my size but was too small. The shoe ran small. My other Merrell's (one I was replacing) was my size but this pair did not fit. Had to return.
0, Warning!!!!: just got the connectors today and apparently 2 pin speakon connectors will only work with 2 pin speakon cables... thanks for the heads up Parts Express..
0, Clancy's loosing it; too political
1, Good As It Get's 
0, violent right wing extremist garbage: The worst book i've read in a long long time. very bad editing
0, This book was simply awful: Tom Clancy puts together a sloppy
0, Please! Clancy Fans
0, Short story; long book; insurance guy playing tough.: I swore off Clancy after Patriot Games. Too many words
0, Tom Clacy at his worst: I did not like his previous book that focused on John Clark instead of Jack Ryan either. This book is cheesy and very predictable. The character development was weak except for the few main characters. The supporting characters were important enough that they should have been developed further. He has sunk to the level of the rest of the pack of military techno-thriller authors. While this would be an accomplishment for some
0, His worst book so far: Little more than a collection of weak action sequences connected by an even weaker plot. Don't buy this one.
0," No multi column view with ""Kindle for Mac"": The multi column view does not work with this particular book.I've never encounter same problem with all other Kindle books"
0, Very Disappointing: To put it simply Tom Clancy latest offering is just plain bad. Rainbox Six is basically an international version of Tom Clancy's Op-Center. The over all plot is totally unbelievable and something that you would expect from a James Bond movie
1, A very good novel.: This is the first Tom Clancy book i read
0, Plot holes you could drive an Abrams through: Although I have liked Clancy's other books
0, Fun: This was the best book I have ever read. I like how the spies where those special Uniforms. the characters did many exiting stuff. I gave this book 1 star because it taught children bad stuff. This is the most wonderful book I have ever read. cheap too! I would recomend it for you.
0," BOOORING: I speed read this book - it is one of the most boring ""thrillers' I have had the misfotune of reading. This book is a rip off and yet another example when an author gets rich and forgets that which got him/her there in the first place and simply mass produces drivel."
0, Unbelievable!! A so-so Tom Clancy novel!: It kills me to say this
0, Disappointing to Clancy fans.: It's interesting to note that most of the 'five-star' reviews below of this book are by people who have not yet finished it. Most of the negative reviews are by people who don't like his politics.I'm someone who loves his politics: I like his patriotism
1, Great Read: I have read several Clancy books. This is probably my favorite. If you like books on spec ops this is the one for you. The book is a little long at 895 pgs for the paperback. Definately worth it.
1, The scrumdiddlyumptious Rainbow Six review: This is a very good book. It is about a group of international anti-terrorists. They are known for saving high profile political heads. One of their members is an old man who is losing is edge. He has to deal with his loss without hurting the group. He is a man who is a war hero
0, Redundant and too long with a poor ending: I was very disappointed and unfortuately wasted valuable time reading 740 pages that I would not suggest anyone else to repeat my error. Nice idea for the plot but it was too predictable. It seemed that the editor or Clancy had to wrap things up in one final chapter after writing and building the plot in over 700 pages... what a waste
1, Well
1, This book is a good buy.: Tom Clancy is at it again
0, Pap
0, Irony at it's best: As an avid fan of Clancy
0, A mixed and confused bag: Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions
1, A good read
0, Without the usual breathtaking tension..: I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in this book and in Tom Clancy (I've read them all). It seems that he starting to repeat himself
0, You want real special operations?: Clancy doesn't cut it with this overblown
1, it was pretty good: This book is worth reading for most people.It was really slow in some parts but the action parts were awesome.Probably not for a person with little patience.
0, Save your money (unless a Clancy fan): What a gagger!Clancy's 1-dimensional characters get more and more boring
0, I bet the video game is more exciting...: While I would consider Tom Clancy one of my favorite authors and will probably buy his next book
1, Disappointing: Like his other Clark book
0," A sequel to ""Without Remorse"""
1, Tom Clancy only gets better with each book...: RAINBOW SIX is a nicely crafted work. Tom Clancy has made
0, Dis-appointment
0, If you want a narrative for the video game...: Rainbow Six is not one of Tom Clancy's better efforts. The reader is taken through an escalading series of contrived terrorist crises driven a most implausible antagonist. The book reads so much like a video game
1, #1 Clancy Book: This is the best book written by Clancy
0, Probably the worst book Clancy has ever written: Reasonable first chapter
0, Boring
0, More junk that will sell: More boys and their toys crap from the man who can't write but who sells like crazy.Those who buy rather than get this from the library should keep in mind that Clancy is a right-winger who loved Star Wars
0, Too far-fetched: ...Clancy undoubtedly is good action writer and a writer who knows the technological gadgetry that goes with the covert operations game. This he uses to good effect.However
1," Great! All the way until the end...: This was my first Tom Clancy novel and I have to say that I truly enjoyed it up to the end. I thought that the ending was somewhat predictable and boring. After reading 700+ pages I expected more of an intense ending and not some rush job. I think the ending must have contracted the ""shiva"" virus."
0, Slow paced
1, Great Book: This is only the second book by Tom Clancy that I have ever read
1, Amazing- Inspiring: An amazing film of how the South Africans made it through apartheid with music being their encouragement throughout. Stories of their revolution songs
0, Not nearly as good as his other products: Let me tell you this. Ross Jeffries' Speed Seduction products are amazing. This book is NOT. If you want to get laid
0, Wrong Goods Received: Well it is Jan. 19 and I am still waiting to receive the correct item ordered Hack Vol. 5. The supplier shipped me Vol. 4 and although I have contacted them on several occasions both through and outside of Amazon.com channels I have yet to receive the correct DVD. My credit card has already been charged for this item and I have yet to receive the correct item supposedly shipped on Jan. 4. Dissatisfied Customer.
1, Womens Reef Sandal: My friend recommended this to me. I love them! I wear them almost everyday! I stand and work on concret most of the day. They are wonderful!! I will buy more!
0," Bridgestone Group VHS Transfer Untrackable EP: 5 stars for Lassie; 1 star for this crummy VHS! Here's more good advice to stick to the MGM VHS! We just bought The Painted Hills in a stated Collector's Edition claiming a ""Direct 35mm Film Transfer"" by the Bridgestone Group. After you open it you find unwatchable garbage that refuses to track in automatic or manual settings on different vcrs! Good idea to email your seller and ask about the studio"
0, Enjoyable Lassie flick
0, A farce: THis book has a scenario that is so unreal
0, Worst Clancy: Flat stupid demeaning characters
0, Racist trash: Clancy is a fine Irish name. With ancestors who suffered so deeply from bigotry and racism
0, Need more cussing: Hey Tom I think you need to use the F word or GD a little more. Every other sentence was just not enough. Normally I can read a Clancy book in 3 days. The last 2 I have had to make myself finish. This one should have gone straight to paper back.......
0, Save your time!This novel is a bomb!: I no longer have RED STAR RISING with which to compare this novel
0, Clancy disapoints an avid fan!: I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since the 'Hunt for Red Ocotber' and 'Red Storm Rising'
0, My Last Clancy: I've read every Tom Clancy fiction title
0, Clancy at his worst: I've read all of Clancy's previous works
0, I'd rate it zero stars if that were an option: A tedious book to read. Unlike anything else I've seen by Clancy. He takes whole chapters to say what could be said (more entertainingly) in a paragraph. (In this he shares a fault with Stephen King...though King is a much better writer.)
0, Worse Clany novel yet: I was looking forward to reading the newest Clancy novel. Most of the time I can't put it down but this one I could. There is hardly any action in this book. Most of his books have been action packed. We also get to read about Clancy's views on abortion. This book is not worth the money. Wait till you can get it at an used book store.
1, The Bear and The Dragon: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read all 1
0, Does Anyone Edit Clancy's Work?: After redreading Executive Orders three times
0, A Great Book If You Have a Lot of Time to Waste!: Tom Clancy is a victim of his own success. Instead of trying to write a compelling story
0, Editors are useful: After slogging through Tom Clancy's Bear and Dragon
1, I think Tom Clancy is by far one of my most favorite writers.: I have been reading Tom Clancy for a really long time......I have enjoyed all of the 45 to 50 books I have read and hope to continue to to follow the exploits of Ryan
0, The Bore and the Drag on: I give. After taking 1028 pages to tell a 350 page story
0, Excruciating...: I can't believe how long this took me to get through. And I can't believe this is the same author of Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. Rainbox Six was a pretty rough read
0, I Just Can't Take Anymore: I'm sorry. I've bought and read every one of Clancy's books since his first
0, Disappointing: This novel did not match up to the high standards I had come to expect from Clancy over the years with almost every other one of his novels to this point (all of which I read). Too wordy for the plot line...and then the end was too rushed in my opinion.In addition
0, Boooring...and waay too long....: I agree with most of the other reviews here. I am a big Clancy fan but it has become apparent in his last few books that he has begun to take himself a little too seriously. I have had this book for at least three weeks and I am still having a hard time getting past the first 300 pages. The techno-geek stuff that was so much fun in the past is almost totally absent. Now all we hear about is politics. And if you don't think Clancy is rambling on and on about his own political beliefs
0, I think it's time Tom retired: I've read the book
0, He crammed 200 pgsof information into 700 pgs of type.: The first 700 pages were mostly boring - developing each character way too much. All kinds of subplots that have little or nothing to do with the main book. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands following surgery I would have put the book down long ago. Don't waste your money on this one.
0," When did ""Clancy Do Dallas""?: I was extremely disappointed that Mr. Clancy had to resort to sweeping out the gutter to replace the English language. Maybe a English 101 class would help. This is the first time I did not want to have my son read a Mr. Clancy book. If he is being paid by the word"
0, Mr. Clancy Does it Again...Too Bad: Once again Mr. Clancy has crammed a good 400-500 page book into 1
0, Disappointed: Read a lot of Clancy and regardless of whether I enjoy them or not or thought they were somewhat slow
0, Bad news bear: This is the worst Clancy book I have read. I have read them all. The only thing I can say is that the same person who wrote Cardinal in The Kremlin or Hunt for the Red October could not have writte this nonsense. A waste of good paper. Do not waste your money on this book. It is clearly written by the same ghost writers who do the OpCenter tripe. This is the most obvious
0, Clancy's dud: This is TC worst book to date. His characters are not developed and as usual he repeats the same thing over and over which does not develop the story. The worst part is that he paints Ryan and the USA as all good guys with the best toys. Not to give away the ending but to only lose 1 Tomcat while defeating all of China is the most preposterous thing imagined. I also got sick and tired of reading how Ryan hated to be president.To add insult to injury (not to mention price of book)
0," Too much baggage: The ""Ryan"" series is starting to suffer from too much ""historical"" baggage"
0, somewhat disappointed: Clancy fell short on this one! I saw him during a recent TV interview and said he hated to write. Well
0, The worst book Clancy has ever written: The Bear and the Dragon is not worth reading. I found this out when I was about half way through the book but wanted to trudge on till the very end. Sure it has some good points
0, Clancy cures insomnia: Clancy again disappoints his readers. Please - where is the editor? Cut out 40 % and the stuff might eventually become readable. The plot is highly predictable and very thin
0, An OK 500 page book. Unfortunately it's over a 1
0," This POS Stinks on Ice from Prologue Forward: What has happened to author who penned ""Red Storm Rising"" and ""The Hunt for Red October""? Me thinks that alien seedpods have done away with the old Clancy and replaced him with a thoughtless"
0, Non-suspenseful and laborious: This may be the last book of Clancy's that I read. Normally
1, Good effort: With so many sub-plots it takes a little while get rolling but...Clancy has done it again. I have always enjoyed Clancy's tales and this one is no exception.Don't over analyze this effort...just sit back and enjoy the tale
0, Not too enamored of 50s rock n roll and France: This little film is a bit schizophrenic and a little too staged for comfort. We are in post war France
1, Great sound quality: This thing is built well and worked great. I've had other FM modulators that connected via the headphone output but they could only select 4 fm stations and didnt work that great. I was impressed with this unit. It has a digital tuner selection where you can choose any frequency you want (200 channels i believe) that gives a strong signal. Also it uses the nano dock connecter which outputs line level rather than headphone so you get a clean sound output. Highly recommended if you dont want to mess with cables and such.
0, A landlord book that's not based on today's reality.: Although Shemin brings up many good ideas
0, Dockers flat-front original khaki pants: Dockers? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit(tm) WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks. Pants rec'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously. Scratchy
1, tough tape: This is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge! You will deinately feel it in the legs. I have the Ultimate Step Circuit and Burn and Firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion...until you can't do anymore. Karen Voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique. Comparable to The Firm Lower Body Split...another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn!
1, Karen Voight Great Weighted: This is a very good DVD. Karen makes you work hard.I also like the fact that she is so fit and sculpted. I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for an exceptional workout.
1," A masterful work that uses words like weapons: Burroughs's vision of decay through the eyes of the junky may be the most innovative (and infuriating) book of the twentieth century. Burroughs blends fact and fiction into a melange of imagery that assaults the senses and purees the brain with its ""trust me/trust me not"" sensibility. Naked Lunch is like Henry Miller meets Thomas Pynchon (though it's faster than Miller and"
0," Huh?: I am about halfway through this ""book"" of 200+ pages of incomprehensible gibberish"
0," ""That's not writing--that's typing""-Truman Capote to Kerouac: Too bad you can't give a book ""zero stars."" This is the worst book ever. Burroughs attempts to offer up the complexity of a ""Ulysses"" or ""Finnegan's Wake"" with none of the talent or intellect. Unfortuanately"
0," Just waste: The people who admire this book just admire other crap like ""rebellious"" artist (like conceptualists and primitivism) If you really looking for a good book read Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Do not ready this scum literature. With respect."
0, Awful Incoherent: This book is purportedly a classic? It is the worst thing I have ever read. Just rambling non-sense of a drug addict pervert.Not even interesting or well written.
1, Too Many Bodies: It was an interesting read
1, My first Nora Roberts: This was the first time I had read Nora Roberts and I really liked her writing style. It was a fast read and every time I put it down
0, What a DUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your time!: This must be one of the worst movies this yr-poorly acted
0," FLUNKED WITH A CAPITAL F: Disjointed....predictable..derivative. Those are just a few of the adjectives I attach to this sub-par slasher flick. The director had these five ""babes"" so to speak"
0, Irritatingly Written But Hard to Argue With: Rick Hess argues from Scripture that Christian couples should not use birth control but trust their sovereign God to bless them with the number of children He will. Hess could have benefitted from having someone else actually write this book for him because his sarcastic tone reveals someone who is reacting to the wrong attitudes in our culture. It's irritating to find such good thoughts presented in so unpersuasive a style. Still

1, GOOD NIGHT MR. TOM: GNMT was a great novel and a great insight in war times. Willie has never experienced life other than the abuse from his motherWhen he stays with Mr. Tom he learns compasion and love and in the end calls him dad as Mr. Tom adopts him. He had never celbrated a birthday or even seen a cow this book is great for all readers at any level.
1, Good night

0, i miss the old always sunny: i am a sunny die hard fanatic. i have turned so many people on to this show. but season 6 was truly not up to par. i dont know what happened. maybe the writers were different
0, Really!?......: I am a huge fan and love the first five seasons
1, Always Sunny: It is one of my favorite shows
1, The best MF book for new investors: I've read Lynch
1, Very Happy!: I really like this blade! Nice and sharp. Get's the job done fast! I am so happy I didn't have to buy a whole new set of clippers...considering mine are kind old. But they still work good and this blade saved me a ton of money. Very happy with this purchase.
1, one of the best games this year: Flight Sim 2000 is a great game if you have a good computer. I currently have a 500mhz computer with the new 3d card and it runs great. The graphics are really good and the game is a lot of fun to play. i suggest buying this if you have a powerful computer.
1, Hallmark Collector's Set Vol. 3: Got it for gifts to my family but I had seen all of the movies on it and knew they would like them.
0, Very poor adhesion to smooth surfacdes: The tape does not stick to smoooth surfaces. I was trying to label plastic drawers and tool box drawers in my home shop. The labels fail to stick and fall off even when the surfaces are cleaned. I must apply contact cement to the label or put scotch tape over them to hold them in place. The labels are probably good to stick on paper but are not good for anything else! Look for something better!
1, Outrun the Sky: I have been attempting to order this product and it was always unavailable or at an extremely high price. It finally became available at a reasonable cost. It was delivered faster than I expected and I am satisfied with the quality and will recommend purchasing from amazon
1, Oh
0, Not the same quality.: I did not do my due dilligence on this item----but I have to say the level of quality was not the same as the turkey cooker pot I bought 5 years ago. If you are considering this item I would advise buying the stainless version instead.
1, Outdoor Cook Pot: The pot worked for our project as planned and we have not determined many more things that we are going to be cooking outside in the furture. This pot is big so it is for those that are creative and love to share their cooking experiences.
1, So delicious
1, Doesn't prevent you from getting sick: A good supplement to take for electrolytes and vitamin C
1, Great veil: I ordered this for my wedding and it worked great. It was shipped fairly quickly. I picked it mainly because the price seemed very reasonable. The quality is just ok
1, Saliva's 3rd Release: Great! if one word describes this album
1, God gave these guys a talent: These guys were truly blessed with sheer musical talent. Think of it DSOTM
1, dark side beauty: Very very beautyful box of Pink Floyd best album 
1, Fantastic: Well what can I say?. Every song I think is fantastic
1, 96/24 Blu-Ray in 5.1-Astonishing!: Okay
1, PF at its zenith: Pink Floyd was in peak form during this recording. Roger Water's songwriting was still more thoughtful than acerbic
1, Not a Wasted Note: A masterpiece of vision
1, A Wonderful Mix To Create an Excellent Album: (...) Of the albums I've heard from Pink Floyd (which include Darkside of the Moon
1, five stars as ever: please dont pay any attention to the one star reviews on this page and my final rating for this classic album will alaways be FIVE STARS.very highly recommended.
1," Excellent album: My favorite Pink Floyd album was Dark Side of the Moon until I bought this one. I sought it out for the title track ""Wish You Were Here"" and was more than pleased with the quality of the other music on the album. Top to bottom this is one of the 5 best albums I own and I own a lot of cds! If you're considering-- don't hesitate"
1, Sounds good to me...: Ive had this CD for a few years now and it sounds much better than the regular release by Columbia. I dont know what the other reviewer is talking about.
1," One of the greatest all-around albums to come out of rock!: Pink Floyd has done it again! This album is one of the greatest complete albums that I have ever experienced. It's driving tunes such as ""Have a Cigar"" and ""Welcome to the Machine"
1, Utterly Essential listening to good for Heretics: Wish You Were Here is Pink Floyd's most cohesive and enjoyable album
1, The only great album from Pink Floyd.: I am not a Pink Floyd fan. I dislike their other albums which are very overrated boring and put me to sleep. Wish You Were Here was the only album I have ever loved from Pink Floyd which all the songs were very wonderful
1, The Movie is Better: Good
0, Save Your Money: Quite simply
1, great singer great albums: this man was without doubt one of the best singersar ound. these 2 lps are brilliant. buy this andany other john gary cd.
0, Disappointing: Very disappointed in this product. Expecting 5 discs worth of classic stooge episodes...got only 1 Curly episode and 3 Shemp episodes. The first disc was an hour long documentary that was interesting
0, Real Bogus Set...: Don't bother with this one. You only get one DVD with any episodes on it (three Shemps and one Curly)
0, Rip Off!: Unfortunately
1, wrap rack: Works really well. No complaints except I wish I had purchased the one allowing for two rows of wrap. Found that after ordering this one. Other complaint is I have not gotten used to having it placed for easier access.
0, I don't like the screws: At my old house
1, Cranford review: I found this book quiet and interesting
0, 10 year old prefers PC version: I have the PC version of zoo tycoon and it is ALOT better than Nintendo DS version. The Nintendo DS version of Zoo tycoon has very poor grafics and the small screen is hard to work with because you can only see a small part of your zoo! If you are going to get zoo tycoon get the PC version because the PC version is so much fun! There are many fun games for Nintendo DS
1," Very Good: I've never had a ""Tycoon"" game"
1, Monei: First it is a movie about the fascinating and complex world of money. Of making money
0, Just a cheqp Starcraft imitation: This is just like Starcraft except it's not nearly as good....if you like Starcraft this is a big dissapointment compared to it.
1, Damn Good: This
0, Caesar III is way better: The problem with this game is that there is no room for artistry. You put up the same buildings
1, Good real time strategy game: I'm usually not crazy about real-time strategy games
1, Fun and challanging for the whole Family: I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he plays it as often as he can. He is very picky about computer games so I was very happy he enjoyed it. What I did not expect was that my 9 year old daughter would also enjoy the game. She plays it as often as he will let her! What more could I ask for in a computer game?
0, AOE is boring and needs more than 128 meg of ram to run well: build build build build build build build. fight. build build build build build build build. lose. that's about it for the Age of Kings from Microsoft. MS just can't get it right with games.
0, Out of Date Information: I agree with the other comments that Ms. Loring is an obviously caring mom who is writing from experience and with compassion
0, missing pages: I knnow it's cheap and former library but at least check the pages before mailing it would be nice.
1, Mayer- The Bestest LIVE!: Basicly theres only one thing to say!!!... ITS GREAT! IF YOU LIKE John like I do. My favorite song on here is why georgia. Thats actually my fav song from him. Theres an intro song that he plays before he goes into Why Georgia that sooooo great!Believe me get this. There are also all the great songs that John does including new ones like message in a bottle that song has a great message to it. :)I hope you all like it!John Mayer IS GREAT!!!...
0, Not worth it: The song selections on this dvd do not represent the tv series. I had hoped that the music by various artists would be the best of La Femme Nikita. Instead I found the songs were not up to the show's episodes.
1, different...but good: Well let's see this CD has quickly become one of my favorites. As well as expanding my musical horizons..it is very enjoyable. In fact I am in the middle of a search
0, Not the one in the picture.: They dont send you the one in the picture. The end that plugs into the (whatever)-pod is much larger. It wont fit with some cases. Not really a problem for me but buyer beware. Also the plug that goes into the (whatever)-pod is made of plastic instead of metal. The whole cord seems cheep but it at 2 bucks for 3 of them its not a bad deal.
0, Does not Support iPad!: I tried it with my iPhone 3Gs and it worked fine. But when I tried it on my iPad
1, Good Product.: I liked this because I didn't like having a lot of cord mess to sync my iPhone. This fixed it!! Quality A++
1, Great for my 7 year old ballet class...: My 7 year olds loved this CD. The narration is sometimes too long-winded to keep their attention
0, Not history and not fiction: I just finished The Drowning Room and even though it was only 250 pages
0, Boring
0, I Agree With Why Do I Bother: Expecting the great Calder saga that came alive in her first three books
0, Dreadful: Ah
0," Is the movie Deepstar Six or Deepstar ""2"" which it is: I was not so impressed with the quality of the movie. The movie's graphics and outdated props where definitive in the movie. The plot is good but they did not show it properly in the movie. Its a low budget movie which it showes. Its an OK movie deserving ""2"" stars of Deepstar ""2"" related to stars. I would rent the movie and not own it since its not such a good one. Its a D- movie."
0, Something Lame...: Where in the world to you decide to take the story from part two
1, Great Reference
1, Great Product
0, Unmitigated Garbage: It would be hard to put into words how awful this movie was
0, forget about gravity or the lawsofphysics?Is this the Matrix: No this is not the matrix. Why does every film now think they can have these slow motion super-human fight scenes when there are no mutants or monsters just charlie's angels(they never flew in the 70's). I have a real big problem with this film. Mainly because it panders to the brainless masses that will watch and love anything that has enough commercials backing it up. Thats the problem they spent the whole buddget on ads and crapy over-priced actresses and forgot to include a plot that does'nt rely on something blowing up every two minutes. Bottom-line I could'nt watch for more than twenty minutes it could very well be one of the worst films ever made.
0, Appalling twaddle: Someone send Cameron Diaz a comb. If Drew were not a Barrymore
0, WHAT THE CRAP: I have not one clue why Hollywood llets movies like this see the light of day. It was a complete wast of two hours. I regret whole heartedly ever watching this movie. Please people move along you have better things to do with your time.
1, In 2011 the movie is still GREAT !!!!!!: When i saw this movie i forgot all about it.After seeing it again i was AMAZED!!!!!! The movie was GREAT.Also shocking to see THE THIN MAN again.I watched this movie about twice A DAY and the bad guy will shock you.Last but not least the action it was so good lots a fighting and the first part of the movie is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0, The worst of the year !!!!!: This must be the worst film of the year
0, UGH!!: Can movies get any worse than this? With Very Little actual plot line
1, A lot of fun: This movie is more of what we saw in the first Charlie's Angels movie: more action-packed fun. While a little plot-skimpy
0," Beyond terrible. Beyond stupid. Beyond pointless.: What is this film about?! It's just the worse thing I've seen for ages. It doesn't even enter into ""so bad it's good"" territory as it is just plain bad. It has nothing to do with ""Charlies Angels"" other than that it is about three good-looking women... It's loaded with Matrix-style effects for no reason other than to say ""Look at the budget we spent on this crap!""An absolute embarrassment for all concerned.Also: I'm afraid to say that comedy legend John Cleese"
1, I'm sorry I love this movie.: I realize this movie is silly in all respects.I just can't help loving it.I've seen it several times and I expect it to just be boringand not like it --- yet I like it again.I'm sorry.I really like it.
0, A joyless attempt to keep a franchise going: I learned something from this bad movie. I learned that FUN is more than a lot of eye candy
1, Brings Back Pleasant Memories of the Movie: I'm glad that I ordered the soundtrack before reading the reviews. After I read the reviews
1, Fun with labels: Four and a half stars
0, Not up to par even at the price: I ordered this model last week because of the price. I thought it would be wonderful for the office. When the product arrived it printed lousy quality text and I very quickly found out that four of the keys on the keyboard did not work correctly thus limiting me to a 22 letter alphabet. My advice is to stick with a higher end product and leave this one alone.
1, Unbelievable clarity: The mid and high range frequencies are reproduced with incredable clarity. You will hear the music as heard in the recording studios. That is to say; you will hear every instrument clearly and distinctly
1, A Nice Collection: Great for the Staind fan with a nice collection of videos. Nothing out of the ordinary
0, Good movie if you have Insomnia....: Okay so I figured I would rent it just to give it a shot and needless to say thank goodness I rented and didn't buy. It was okay
0, Please remove the A870 from item title and description: This item is not for the Samsung A870. It physicaly does not fit. The Seller was awesome in providing a quick refund but the title and description of this item needs to be changed. IS NOT FOR THE A870.

1, Great Bag: This gets a lot of looks while driving. The improved drag helps with gas. Easy to install once you have the straps set up for your vehicle. Hold a lot. Easy to load and unload. I wish thy had better cushions for the straps that rest on vehicle. I use a towel and wrap around straps that rest on the car to prevent any scratching. I think it will be fine with the cushions that come with it.
0, This film stunk!: I actually worked on this film -- painting the scenery. Mancini is the nicest guy alive
1," Good crime/mafia film: I enjoyed this movie and the casting is great. It is about the conflicts between the mafia and American Italian policeman that were born and raised in the same neighborhoods. The leading female role played by Mia Sara is the wife to ""Joey"" the police officer in the film. I think there are 1-2 actors from the HBO Sopranos in this film too. This film was made before the Sopranos became a big hit. I recommend this film."
1, The Edge: This book was great. Love Catherine Coulter. I couldn't put the book down. It kept me on the edge of my set.
0, Disappointing: I've read almost all Catherine Coulter's works. Until this book

0, Bah
0, Not the 60s movie: Careful here. This is an obscure music DVD
0, Makioka madness: It was recommended to me as a good insight into Japan of the 40s but I found it incredibly long winded with massive excessive detail. It is probably a cultural thing but I feel it could have been edited to a short story. And should have been. The writing wasn't bad but not fantastic but it just went on into ever more minute detail for no story advancement and to me the ending was left hanging. I could not recommend this book.
0, slide show: i wish i knew how these people with 266 machines are getting this hog to run well....i have a 300 with all the bells and whistles and FS2000 doesn't even get off the ground. the frame rate is a freakin' slide show. it takes minutes at a time to load or change scenarios. putting a 166 as the minimum requirement is blatant false advertising. but i'm sure it's a great sim. someday i'll buy a 500 and check it out.until then i'll be satisfied with 98 and some of the excellent add ons available for it
0, OK...but not great: I have been playing Hold 'Em successfully for 10 years and finally decided to buy this book because I heard so much about it. It was not the best investment I've ever made.Sklansky and Malmuth are both very knowledgable about the game...odds
1, The Best: This book is set up great. Small quips about various aspects of poker. This book is great for limit.
0, This makes me angry: I bought this title hoping it would contain something
1, Three Fates by Nora Roberts: This is my number 1 favorite writer. She is so good. The book is in great shape I have already read it and passed it on to my Sister in Tenn. This book The Three Fates are a ver good read.
1, Ponyo DVD/Bluray Combo: AWESOME!!!My 3 yr old twins (boy/girl) love the colors and scenery of the movie. The story of love between two people beyond anything physical and without any selfish motives
0, Not the best Hayao Miyazaki film by far: I am a big fan of anime
1, hoping more ponyo toys to be marketed!: the minute i watched this movie with my 3 year old daughter and heard her point and yell
1, A sweet gentle story that will appeal to all ages
1, Liked the fan-pretty and functional: The fan was delivered promptly
1, Good movie: This movie is really funny. Eddie did a great job. The actors were picked amazing well. This movie is good for friday nights.
1, Funny Movie for the Entire Family: Eddie Murphy returns to the screen with this hysterical comedy about Daddys running a day care center
0, leather is micro thin and cracks / peels in a few years: not at all comfortable and the so called leather is so thin that it cracks and peels within a few years. Bought two of these chairs and an otterman and all three piecess cracked and peeled
1," Hunter 1090-40 and 1090-50 Holsters: I now own 3 of these Hunter made holsters. The 1090-50 crossdraw ""only"" fits Colt clones with barrels up to 7 1/2"". The 1090-40 ""two way"
0, Awful DVD transfer: This is a real fun movie but this Platinum Disc release looks and sounds like a bad VHS tape. I've seen a good
1, Great Movie: One of the best pirate films of all time.Film quality is okay
0, Disappointing: I am sorry to say that this book did not live up to my expectations by any means. If you are not a running fanatic
1, Adventure!: Funny
1, Outstanding Book for Boys: My son is in a book club for boys and this was their latest read. The book is an outstanding case study in determination
1, A true American genius!: Everyone should know about Nathaniel Bowditch. A true pioneer in his day and age
1, Carry On
1, Cunningham is the best.: I enjoyed this book a lot. I especially liked the section on creating your own Wiccan tradition and all the symbols and runes. If you are new to the Craft
1," A must have for the solitary witch.: This is a great book! It focuses more the religion of the wiccan way of life than spells and formulas. ""Wicca"" was about the craft and ""Living Wicca"" focuses more on the religion. This book is a must have on my magickal bookshelf."
1, Information I could understand: Lynn O'Shaughnessy's book Retirement Bible was informative and helpful as I plan for my retirement. It was in a format that even I could understand. I appreciated her help on buyer beware. I will probably hire a good financial advisor to assist and this book has educated me
0, Great Book...But amazon...: The book is great for someone who doesn't know much about digitalization.I ordered this book and just received it. I am very disappointed in Amazon because I received the book in a poor condition
0, Where's the zero star button?: This guy's a clown in his own right. If you want to train your abs and need a damn good laugh and don't mind spending 20 bucks
0, not so good.: Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would
0, Overheated Sony: We also have experienced the overheat/shutdown problem. It was sent to Sony under warranty and returned with the same problem. To use this laptop you need to prop the back of the unit up on a book or something to allow air under it.
0, crappy picture: Great if u have an old tv that doesnt have the red
0, A truly low quality
1, great toy for all ages: I have 2 boys
0," Don's Waste Your Time Or Money...: Why did ""Top 50 reviewer"" Angel Lee feel compelled to rate this book TWICE and give it five stars each time? Without those two gushing"
1, Nice semple: really my son like it i had 9 books and its very good for his age he is 4Y old.its good quality and cheap.
1, Med kit: Purchased for my father-in-law for Christmas to put in his truck. He is an outdoor person and I think this could come in handy if the need ever rises.
1, wonderful book: Wow. I can't believe this book is still around and that I found it! When I was in 1st-3rd grade I would go into the school library everyday and read this book. I absolutely loved it and it made me love my mother a lot more than I wanted too at the time. :-) At the risk of sounding corny
1, Beautiful and Memorable Story: This book is the greatest
0, Its not that good..: I remeber when I first read about the band
0, WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS?: This movie is nothing but soft-core porn. That is the problem with Gay & Lesbian movies: They are overflowing with SEX. I am a gay man that owns HUNDREDS of movies
1, If you're in ortho you must get this.: Every resident needs to get this book. Excellent information and anatomy gives you a leg up and makes you look good in the operating room.
1, simply magnificent: A safety net for anyone performing orthopaedic procedures weather a trainee or a specialist. Great detail and points out nicely potential pitfalls in a much better and more effective way than similar books. Very expensive but money well spent
1, This book is not just for fun to read
0, Has technical merit but characters are awful: Carl Sagan has done a good job of popularizing a sciences such as astronomy and physics and making them accessible to non-scientists like myself. The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly simplistic.Also
0, Definetly not another Isacc Azimov: Carl Sagan may be a brilliant public relations man for science. And for that I thank him. But he should have stuck to TV shows. I struggled to enjoy this book and eventually stopped halfway through. The general story line is okay
0, Did Y'all Have A Different Version of this Book?: I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this title. I've read a lot of books
1, A prophetic
0, Sagan's COSMOS needs a booster rocket!: What's to like about Carl Sagan's one and only SF novel? The characters are stiff
0, Not that good: I gave my dog this ball and chased him around the house with it for about 5 minutes. Then I took a break and got something to eat and came back and it was torn up and pieces of it were laying on the floor. The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because my dog has also ripped through the tiger tested toys that Kong has so it just might be that my dog has very sharp teeth!
1, Beast of a Dog loves this toy!: I got this toy for my daughter's dog. She is 80 pounds and 10 months old. She tears most toys up
0," kong ball destroyed: when i bought this ball for almost $15 i thought ""great a real durable dog toy"" well after 2 weeks my dog (a 2 years old german shepherd) destroyed the ball (literally) ate it and pooped it out a day later...til this day i cant seem to find a real long lasting dog play toy."
0, Depends on your Dog: My dog is a flat-coat retriever
1, active aussie in the NW: My Australian Shepard loves the Kong ball
1, Aztec: One of the things I like about Mr. Jennings work is that he manages to describe the cultures he writes about in the contex of that culture. It's rare to be thrown so completely into a world that no longer exists and discover only when you've put the book down that you had left your own world and all its judgmental comparisons behind for a few hours.
1, Incredible Amount of Detail and an Engaging Story: Gary Jennings' massive novel Aztec is packed with so much detail that it could double for nonfiction--and should find its way into many classrooms across the country. But background info isn't everything
1, The best book I've ever read: This may be the biggest book I've ever read but once I started
0, Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews here: I can't for the life of me understand why so many people like this book so much. It's the worst piece ... I ever finished (Stephen King's It being the worst one I didn't bother finishing). If you know ANYthing about the Aztecs
1," This will be added to my ""favorite books"" list: If you are faint-hearted"
0, A let-down
0, Wish I'd never read it!: I know I'm in the minority but I wish I'd never read it! If you're not into blood and gore
0, Still Shocked: Well to continue with my previous review I must say after my blender blew the motor on the first use I sent it back in to get repaired in the hopes of getting a new one that I could return to get my money back since they don't give you a refund at Salton unless you purchase it directly from them. Unfortunately they kept it at the repair shop for 3 weeks so of course then the 30 day return period with Amazon was over. So now I'm stuck with another one so I figure I might as well use it
0, RENT? I'M ON STRIKE!: I am still on a Rent strike: Director Chris Columbus' cinematic take on Jonathan Larson's tale of friends and lovers
1, I love this movie so much.: I got the 2 disc special edition
0, worst movie I have ever seen: Boring
1, Refreshing beauty: A beautiful CD
0," [...]: It says it runs 120 minutes at full load. Mine did about 7 minutes at 35% load... at that point we were at 30% level - the so-called ""deep cycle"" battery discharge according to the control software.Think about it: 830 watts is about 70 amps at 12 volts. 70 AMPS! A car battery might last an hour if it was new at this load"
1, A Classic Resource for the Serious Bible Student: In addition to the Bible 
0, broken candy: candy arrived broken~not good quality and unable to use the broken pieces in Christmas arrangement. I would neverparchase these again.
0, WAY overpriced: This is one of those things that I must have for the holidays. Walmart has always been a reliable supplier.. until this year. Even so their price was typically around $2.00 per box. When I saw this on Amazon my first thought was that it was for a CASE of
1, arrived on time: looked all over in the stores for this. glad you had it available. my friend loves ribbon candy and was surprised
0, hurry up and end: this was one of the worth movie that i have rent so far the cover looks interesting but the movie is bad.
1, Great escape!: I loved this book. It was such a great escape from my own life. The story and characters kept me intrigued. I was eager to get to the end to see how it all played out
1, Superior California Pop with Del and Petty: This is a fine example of a idea that makes sense -- combine Del's vocal and unique songwriting talent -- with production and backing by Petty and the Heartbreakers (at the top of their form). The surprising thing is that the idea works! Del sounds fabulous
0, Pointless Microsoft clone of EQ: Okay
1, Good Astronomy: Nice history of telescopes and all associated equipment. He opens the heavens for both amateurs and professionals and makes for easy reading.
0, Oops! Maybe a lemon?: I traditionally buy Panasonic for their great reputation. With this VCR
0, Waste of Money and Time: If you have enough money and you want to waste it then buy this VCR. If you have also a lot of free time that you like to spend it try to set this VCR and visiting Panasonic Service Centers then again buy this VCR.Dont make the same mistake. I just bought this VCR and I spend all night trying to set it up with not success. I called Panasonic to help me and again with no success. They told me also to put a tape in and push play but even this was not working. The VCR was completely broken. Its such a shame for Panasonic to sell such product to the market.The result was to return this VCR and pay the shipping because I really had enough.
1, Simple
1, love this game: this game offers so much from a full world to wallk in and tons of enemies to kill. The second one was great but this tops my list of RPG games ever. I have never been so awe struck by such grafics or gameplay. Total control over your player and tons of weapons to choose from. Fun story line and great movies to watch as you go deeper into the world. Chalenging bosses and formidable foes. You feel like you are in the game and have control of an army of your own. Great game. pick it up if you can.
0, Skip this one: My son loves any type of game that deals with farming
0," Don't Even Think About It: Had the main character been as endearing as Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"" this may have been more palatable. Since that was not the case you kept hoping for something redeeming or different. Not gonna happen. So this just isn't really worth your time. In fact it will quite possibly give you a headache watching the same pieces shown over and over so you can see what he does different to try to fix it. I can suggest far to many Christmas movies that are better. On a replayability scale ""Christmas Do-over"" won't be done over"
0, Waste of time: What a waste of time. A very poor ripoff of the far superior Ground Hog Day. Don't bother with this piece of coal.
1, A Must Have: This is a must have for all families
1," Correction of paraphrase from earlier review: I'd like to make a correction in my earlier review where I purportedly paraphrase the song ""If Only"". I have seen the lyrics on the Internet"
1, Good Program: I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I use W2000Pro
0, I'm furious about this!: I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2. It worked fine for a handful of months
0, Adobe Limpness: Photoshop is a pretty powerful tool
0, Worked OK for 4 years
0, Worst Amazon product ever purchased: Given mostly favorable reviews in the past
1, Just a great watch for casual or filed use: This is a great watch.When I am not at work i am wearing this watch. Super luminous dials
0, Important Variant Readings Missing: The apparatus of this edition lacks all variant readings which are important for someone interested in stylistic problems. The codex Alexandrinus on which this edition is heavily based is very much an atticised version of the New Testament. However
0, My dog didn't seem to notice: I bought this for my 1 year old Westie who I am trying to crate train. He will bark and whine non-stop while in his kennel
0, Monitor failed after only 2.5 years: Expensive 
1, BEST RUSH CD IN YEARS!!: ALOHA..I HAVE BEEN A RUSH FAN FOR MANY YEARS..I WAS PERSONALLY NOT TO EXCITED OF THEIR LAST CD BUT THIS CD MAKES UP FOR IT..AWESOME MUSIC!! HARD LIKE THE OLD DAYS..THAT THE RUSH I LOVE..LONG LIVE RUSH..MAUI'S #1 FAN..JAY
0, I Just Don't Get The Modern RUSH: Concerning RUSH's last three studio recordings
1, Everytime Rush releases a new album......: I hear the same stuff
1, Simply their best work to date.: What else is there to say? This is a phenomenal album. The extras on the MVI are well worth the additional price.
1, Best Rush album in years: All i can say is listen to this disc in your car at nite on a long drive and take in every single note and every single word like it was intended and you will see just what a great and layered piece of work this is! Rush just blew me away with this. They are by far my favorite band of all time
1, Rush
1, Must let go of the Old Rush-reluctantly: I am an old Rush fan so I must be real. It does not matter how good a new Rush CD is
0, RIP RUSH: Very dissapointing. Production is good
0, Where is Rush?: Has anybody seen Rush? Yes
0, You've Got To Be Kiding Me!!: You meen these guys are still around?? They've all got to be like 40 now. The music sounds tired and dated
0, Save your money. This ain't a DVD-A.: High-res 2-channel and 5.1 DD. That's not a typo. They couldn't even bother with full-bitrate DTS.I'll leave it at that.
0," made in china: I have some diatonics and wanted to try chromatic on what I figured would be a basic 8 hole harmonica. Right out of the box this harp looks and feels really cheap. Every one of my diatonics cost half the price and look like real quality in comparison. On the back of the box is a sticker ""made in china"" Unfortunately you don't know until you get it and it can't be returned. It may or may not play well. I can't get used to it. the 8 holes are checker board layout (cross tuning?) open & closed holes alternate upper & lower. If I try chromatic again I won't take a chance on Hohner. I'll go with Suzuki where I know what i'm getting."
1, Don't think of the old showtrack.: When I recieved the CD I couldn't wait to give it a play. Soon my baissed ears told me that I liked the old soundtrack much better. Eventually I give it a few more spins and then went to see the film.How glad am I
1, Dreamgirls CD: I enjoy listening to most of the songs on the CD. All of the songs from the movie are in the CD. I'm glad that I purchased it.
1, If you like the movie you'll like the album.: Great music from the movie. My only complaint is it's literally pulled from the movie
1, AMAZING: My two daughters and I love the soundtrack. We have been playing it nonstop!! All of our passengers
1, Took A While: Took me a bit to appreciate this one
1, Much better approch than any conventional medicine: Dr. Zhang has an incredibly sensible approach to staying healthy and treating this disease
1, Kids for character: I purchased this video for my 3yr old granddaughter because she had seen the previews on on older Barney video. She absolutely loves it and will sit and watch it repeatedly. She refers to the personality characteristics being taught and proclaims herself as a Kid for Character. Although it was in a used VHS format
1, Five stars on my list of children videos: This is an amazing video for young children and adults alike. It teaches the six pillars of characetristics in an easy way. In each pillar there is a skit to go along with each pillar
0, DISAPPOINTED !!!: I purchased this VCR with the intent of enjoying the bells and whistles that came along with this unit
1, Makes brownies crazy: I got this
1, A wonderful spiritual book: This is one of the best spiritual texts I have read along with Eckhart Tolle's writing. De Mello and Tolle both point us in the same direction of awakening. Anthony De Mello uses short little humorous stories to point to the reasons why we suffer. Awareness is a great little book to refer to from time to time. It is worth owning. The lessons and realizations it provide are priceless. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is sick of suffering.
1, Deep reaching and hard hitting at times: Beware.. this book can cause paradigm shifts. It did for me and I was not a newbie to reading information on bettering ones life. He writes in a simple way and answers lots of questions you probably had in the back of your mind and some you did not even know you needed an answer to. He brakes down some walls that prevent you from looking deep and clears up guilty feelings for common things that I think people with higher moral values tend to feel. His other book the Way to Love is also great and hard hitting in my opinion.
0, What a waste!!!!: What a waste of talent and my time. I wish I would've known this movie sucked this bad
0, Mama I want to sing: I found this movie to be dull and slow paced. I expected more music
0, Awful: I rented this movie from Redbox and the $1.20 I paid was too much. About 20 minutes in my boyfriend and I couldn't take it anymore. Ciara has clearly never acted before and the plot was terrible. Plus
0, Stay a way from this video......PLEASE!: this video is so boreing to even watch[...] First of all I never heard of this movie.. so I thought it looked cool and then I bought it. Boy was I wrong.... The PICTURE of this movie was horribal. I had to stand by the TRACKING button to keep the picture ok
0, Pure Rocky Road Trash!: I can't believe I watched the whole thing! There are movies that are so bad that they are actually good...well this ain't one of them! These celebs reached an all time low when they signed on for this garbage. Clint Howard
0, Great title
0, garbage bags are a better deal: These tweeters are junk. I got them in a swift manner and a cheap price
0, Terrible picture quality on recordings: This VCR has many wonderful bells and whistles
0, Poor quality is the halmark of the Panasonic PV-V4621: Have had to return the unit twice (so far). The replacement was worse than the original. Avoid Panasonic products made in Indonesia and Mexico. Products made in Japan are much better.
0," Pick another. 1001 nights better.: I like such compos by these guys as ""1001 nights"""
0, The Borrowers: Quite honestly
1, Good Product -wrong choice: My wife had a pair of West County gloves which she loved
1, Giant doll house: This house is great value as long as you know haw to use a screw driver maybe add some wood glue and a few extra screws and it is solid and my stair case is still in place
0, giant garbage pile: My daughter has been asking for a large dollhouse since she was 4 but we waited until we knew she would be able to take care of it and use it properly. We finally decided on this dollhouse and when we got it we found the thing is made of cardboard and particle board with very few actual braces made of real wood. There isn't enough hardware to keep the thing together and it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use by my mature seven-soon to be eight- year old. She was devastated. I found a much better dollhouse by Imaginarium that is almost the same price as this. To me the extra 10.00 is worth it knowing that my daughter will have a dollhouse she can actually USE. Please don't buy this dollhouse
0," Wished I'd Read The Reviews- ""Junk"" is the right word: Yes"
0, Review of quality of Kindle version
1, Pure Genius: First published in 1949 this book will never go out of print while there is still a demand for startling
0, Kindle Edition has some major issues.: 1. The Kindle edition is not actually the full text. In fact
0, Pseudo-economics: I'm delighted that what's left of Ayn Rand's teaching is slowly rotting away as people in general becomes more educated. No
1, Baalanced and consistently interesting: I found this book was fair to Johnson
0," Panasonic PV-C1331W 13"" TV/VCR Combo with FM - Don't buy it!: I have had two of these units fail within 6 weeks with the same identical problem. The audio record head fails to function. This means that you can record a new show and the sound track from whatever you are taping over remains as the sound for the new show. This makes for interesting viewing!Panasonic has discontinued this model"
0, Do yourself a favor...buy another brand.: I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the unit less than three months ago and can no longer use the VCR portion because the VCR heads are so dirty. I record everyday and had no idea the VCR heads were dirty until I went to playback a tape. All I saw was snow and a blue screen message telling me the VCR heads needed cleaning. After going out and purchasing the recommended VCR Head Cleaner tape per the manual
0, Not playable in US: Was looking for a DVD to play for my high school class who is reading this book. The DVD description did not mention that it was not zoned for the United States. After going through a huge hassle with returning the last DVD I bought
0, horrified: I was amazed to learn that this movie was shown to my 12 year old daughter
0, Awful Adaptation.: After reading the book and seeing the film made in the early sixties I was tempted to rent this
0, BAD: I hated the video so much that I had to find a way to vent my dissapointment. I read the book in high school and it quickly became one of my favorites. When I saw they remade the movie I was hoping that maybe someone would follow the storyline of this classic. But no
1, It is an ok movie: This updated version of this movie is quiet a change from the book. But
0, It was ok
1," ONE OF HER BEST!!!: This time around Latifah is as hot as ever in terms of lyrical prowess.The fault lays with the music.Side A of this cassette is great but some of the tracks on Side B however are from fair to good.The production was lacking some.This is most evident on the track 12 ""I DON'T KNOW"""
1, COEN BROTHERS MEETS QUENTIN TARANTINO! 4 1/2 STARS!: I caught this film on cable a while back and finally got around to watching it on my DVR. The film will remind some of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino films with its off the wall characters and familiar cast in such films. It's a very good film
0, Don't waste your time and electricity.: Maybe
0, Overview book: I was looking for an in-depth
1, Metal that rocks from hott babes! What more do you want?: Drain is a metal band I think from sweden
1, Great drops!: I have purchsed these drops in the past and had to order them again because they really help clear his nose up before bed time and during the day. I use them on 'as needed' basis. My son has been using these drops since he was about 3 years old and I would not stop until I am able to find a better product or he is old enough to use stronger solution to help with the stuffiness.I tried a lot of other products on the market trying to find the best one to help him breathe easy through the night and get a good-night sleep with little success until I found these drops. You cannot find them in the stores
0, Bottles Arrived Empty!: When I received my order
1, Possibly the best
1, Silly Romp: It's an old movie - so it has all the characteristics of an old movie - slow paced
1, Good
0, not very helpful: My 12 year old son has ADD. I work with him frequently on organization. I did like the checklists
1, Great Book!: I bought the updated book (2004) [...]. It is a positive book that helps you and your child understand his behavior better.
0," another INSULT from MGM ....full screen? this sucks!: I love the two GATOR movies...saw them when I was a testosterone filled high schooler and Burt Reynolds was THE action star of my day....but these DVDs ""White Lightning"" and ""Gator"" have been transformed from 2:35 aspect ratio...WIDE widescreen to 1:33...thus chopping the heck out of them..watch the credits chapter on GATOR to see how the film should be shown..DOES MGM think that only dumb old geezers who don't understand film formats would watch these? WHY the dumbed down versions..I'm ordering overseas where they RESPECT the films"
1," Bloodmusic meets the Thing: I am not easily scared but this flick has the right balance of fright and philosophy to satisfy an intelligent viewer. It is obviously inspired by Greg Bear's Bloodmusic novel and Carpenter's movie the Thing. Peter O'Toole is marvelous as the mad scientist and a rare horror film role for him. I liked the ideas it presents clashing Darwin's natural selection as the unseen ""ancient enemy"" versus a version of Christian eschatology. Great fun!"
0, No Subtitles for Hard-of-Hearing: This DVD is a great bargain unless you are hard of hearing; then it's no deal at all. There are no subtitles or any other on-screen options in this bare-bones version DVD release. No previews
0, Why oh why Ben and Liev?: How do they get awesome and talented stars such as Ben Affleck and Liev Schreiber into movies like this? I'll admit that I watched it because these two actors were in it. They did admirably well with what little they were given. Definetely not one of the best movies I have ever seen. However
1, Great movie
0, O'Toole and McGowan are the only good things in it.: I read the book before I saw the movie...and the book stank
0, A Turn Off: A movie is supposed to entertain
1, A piece of southern candy -- a guilty read: I did not even think of reading The Bridges of Madison County -- too syrupy for my taste and this novel is definitely in that vein. But
0, Amuzed
1, The Notebook: I loved the book. It was a little different from the movie which I'd already seen but still a great book!!
0, in someone's else's hands...: ...this could have been a good book. as it it is: ugh. there's just no personality to it. his writing is so white bread and that sucks any life out of what otherwise could have been a heart twister. there were sparks (no pun intended) of brilliance
0, Cliche and dull: There was no conflict in this story that was actually confronted at any point. The romance was just... ugh. I don't even know how to describe it. There was nothing new and intriguing about this story.
1, A very romantic
1, Absolutely Wonderful!!!!: I as a 16 year old male read this book. It was one of the best books I have read. I have never read a love story before
1, A Wonderful Book: This is an absolutely amazing book! It is a touching story about a man's love for his wife and the trails they are put through in their elderly years. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. It's simply wonderful.
0, WB got riped off: I've got to say this is THE WORST book I've read in a very long time. The plot was... wait... what plot? Character development was no where to be seen. Descriptive passages so boring I wanted to stick a fork in my eye to breakup the boredom... I kept reading thinking it might get better
0," There are miracles in this world: How this manuscript even got published in the first place is a miracle. Truly. This book is an inspiration for any aspiring writer because it shows you that almost anything can get published and marketed these days. It uses every cliche in the book and breaks about every rule about writing fiction. ""I love you"
0, Great premise
0, This doesn't deserve one star: This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The cheese is laid on entirely too thick
1, a characterization of our time: I think that what makes a novel great is its ability to characterize the feelings that are predominant in society. During their times
0, I really wanted to like it.: It sounded like something I would like. Really
0, Nicholas Sparks must have a great agent and publicist.: After skimming through the 189 or so reviews I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who thought this book was a total waste of time. Luckily
0, not romantic: First of all
0, Not a favorite: I was so excited to read this book...it had so much potential...but it ended up pretty much sucking. No detail
0, Plenty of corn and schmaltz: I marvel at the way people have given this work more than one star. The sentimentality oozes out of the writing and often
0, Where's the beef?: Some women I work with recommended this book and said it was sure to make me cry. I read it with amazement that anyone would find this thin
0, This book is a waste of time to read.: This book came highly recommended from a friend. I
1, This IS what love is all about......!: I have read most of N. Sparks' books
1, Absolutely Incredible!: Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer. I will read this book many times over. Never has a book ever moved me as much as this one has.
0, Boring: However
1," The best ""lost love found"" story in years: The book grabs you like two big old soft but not so secure arms as you find yourself in the story of two adults who found first love as teens"
1, Wonderful love story.: All I can say is Wow. This was one of the best love stories I have ever read. Anyone who has read Nicholas Sparks other books and enjoyed them will be equally saitisfied with this one. The last chapter of the book was a wonderful way of showing how love can overcome everything.
1, I keep a copy with me at all times to read parts of it!: I loved this book! As soon as I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was so realistic and probable. The beauty in the words that the man wrote sang to my heart. I've recommended this book - no
1, I loved The Notebook.: The Notebook was one of the more enjoyable books I have read in a long time. Despite the sad storyline I found it inspirational that love two people could love one another so much.
0, sickeningly sweet: Garbage
0, Sappy
0, Too much perfection: A truly great love story should be about real people with real faults and real warts. Sparks writes his story about handsome Noah who reads poetry
0, If women wrote romance this bad it would never be published: Cripts. First The Bridges of Madison County
0, No literary merit: What a disasterous novel!Sparks is a romance novelist at the most
0, A most contrived notebook indeed. Fail!: I'm a male reader who reads and enjoys romance. With much interest did I pick this book
0, What a bunch of sap!: I thought this was one of the most over-written
1, Kiwi Sloggers brighten the day!: I had a pair of these Sloggers for ten years.The soles are now worn smooth and are too slippery in the wet grass.I purchased this new pair at a price cheaper than the original pair. The new color selection was nice .Love the Kiwi green color.I originally purchased a Size 7 that was a bit small with a low cut sock. However the problem of not giving a five star rating enters here
1, Comfy but warm: These shoes are comfy! I wear a 7 1/2 and bought an 8
0, Good info - Bad production: The information on this DVD is good but the actual production of the DVD is rubbish.The sound quality is very average and his voice seems to be rushed and muffled in parts.Also is is very hard to pick out what he is playing without slowing the DVD down.He seems to rush over important bits.I have the book as well and the two compliment each other .
1, It's counter intutitive: Finally the world is being exposed to the thinking of Austrian economists after decades of Keysian propaganda. This book is another of the recent number of books on the subject. Like the others
1, The most honest music I've heard since The Floating Men: After first listening to Car Wheels
0, Hyped and Overated: What
0, very disappointed: This has convinced me to get Real Player and never buy another CD without listening to it. With all those five-star reviews
1, Big Hemingway fan: Very well written with lot's of first person experiences with Ernest to share - at times you almost feel like you are sitting at Ernest's favorite Havana bar with them. Hemingway was a very interesting character and this book does great job of aquatinting the reader with the eclectic and fascinating and unique American icon. Enjoyed the read vey much!
1, AWESOME pictures!!!: The story is funny
1, One of the best books on TCP/IP I've ever read: I highly recommend this book to whoever wants to have solid understanding of TCP/IP.It covers even advanced topics with a clear and simple approach.In my opinion this is a must have book on TCP/IP.Absolutely well spent money!
1, This is Canada's best kept secret!!: This album is amazing I can expres so much on this album but buy it you won't be dissapointed...
1, Fully brilliant --- buy it: A wonderfully gracious
1, Get this book back in print!: This series is a masterpiece. Buy it (if you can) and set aside enough time to read it. It's worth every minute. The 'plague' referred to in a previous review is the biological mechanism that allows the human inhabitants of the planet to survive the massive temperature extremes that occur over the 'year' (1000 earth years). The temperature ranges from sub-sub arctic to ultra-tropical and the physical changes as the people go from short fat and conservative Winter people to tall thin active Summer people are described with marvellous detail.The story of the humans and their interaction with the natives of the planet is interwoven with the technical information with a masterful flair.This series is similar in breadth and vision to the Eden series by Harry Harrison
0, Everfine Palm Tree T Shirt: Item was a little flimsy....and sizing was not correct....We ordered an extra large
1, A Guilty Treat!: I'm not ashamed to confess that the this was the first CD I ever purchased. That said
0, anything these guys did sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: lame
1, Good read: When God becomes ApParent is a great read and very insightful in how God plays such a significant role in your life growing up.
1," Brel en Public Olympia 1964: The joy of the audience and the power of Brel's voice combine to create a sense of being in the theatre while Jaques Brel performs the songs on this album/cd. The pain of ""Amsterdam"""
0, expensive battery - does not last long: Bought product and checked out good. Like the interface (color code to indicates high/normal temp). A few month later when I needed it
0, Battery issue: When the item came
0, Doesn't Work Straight from the Box.: Right out of the box
0, More Junk from Vicks!: Another Vicks thermometer. And still more junk! It dies very fast. And changing batteries doesn't work. Please don't buy a Vicks thermometer.
1, SCARY
0, Ok I guess: The book was great but I have never seen such BAD acting in any other movie. Read the book and skip the movie!
0, Not What I Thought It Would Be: I talked to some guy that worked at Block Buster and he said this movie was really creepy and scary. I never thought older movies were scary but the guy said they were. Ends up
0," Stephen King butchers Stephen King: There are a lot of disturbing things about the film adaption of Stephen King's PET SEMATARY--and I don't mean ""good horror disturbing."" The worst is that Stephen King finally got the chance to adapt his own novel for the screen. And he butchers his story as bad as any other hack job that's ever been done. Maybe it looked good on paper (I'm referring to the script)"
1, 4.5 stars means awesome-tastic: I have always loved this movie. I agree with some of the bad reviews that the book was better. True
0, FOUND IT KINDA DISTURBING...: I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS STUPID. I KNOW STEPHEN KINGS MOVIES ARE THE BEST BUT THIS WAS VERY DISTRUBING
0, Deceptive advertisement: This advertiser listed Wilcox Squirrel Bait StationSquirrel Bait Station - SQUIRREL BAIT STATIONas a package of 6. When I received only 1 bait station
0, Though advertised as widescreen
1, Evil Dead: Evil dead is typically a very good game. Fistfull of Boomstick got a freaking 2/5 in most mags i was like WTF. REGENERATION BEATS BOOMSTICK BY 10 points REGENERATION THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY XBOX GAMER.
0, Roll up USB piano: Bad device
0, It works but requires awkward pressure on keys: This keyboard is worth the $23
0, Inaccuracies make it useless: This thermometer always gives readings around 96.5 to 97.5 degrees. As such
1, Fast
0, Good Initially: Documentation was poor as we needed to change the display from Fahrenheit to Celcius. We finally decided to search the Internet to find the answer. The thermometer was great after that but then when we needed it less than a year later it failed us as the battery had died. We had only used it that first time so we basically only got that one use out of it. When trying to open the battery compartment we were shocked to find that it was impossible to open. We have also read other reviews stating that once opened it was impossible to actually find a replacement battery. Makes a great first impression but doesn't weather the storm when you need it later!
0, !!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS THERMOMETER!!!!: This thermometer SUCKS!! It takes approximately 5 minutes to give a reading and if your baby moves just a bit
0, Yes
0, Nastiest thing you'll ever taste: The 'little' series is usually pretty good
1, Would give it 5 Stars but how would you rate Sgt Peppers: I just made a tape of this album for a friend and he came back saying if not for Ringo's rather weak voice this and a few of his others would really make him the best solo Beatle. That shocked me so I went back and gave it a good listen. You know I love John and Paul but to tell you the truth this really could be the best Solo Beatle album music wise. Time Takes Time I always thought was better but Vertical Man has a polish that is special. Buy this
1, Tainted Trail is a real page turner!: I have read both Alien Taste and Tainted Trail. I found both of them to be excellent books. Of the two
1, Great content
0, An Important Warning: Be warned: I ordered a copy of this with great anticipation
1, Satisfied for the Holidays: Everything about this order was exactly as I needed it to be. The sizes are accurate
0, Scotts Drop Spreader dropped it on this one: When one hears the name Scotts
0, Peter Rabbit Book: This book was a color photo copy
0, Disappointing Abridged Version: I love the story of Peter Rabbit so I was excited to buy this board book for my new baby
1, *The original and authorized edition*: When this was published in 2002 on the occasion of the original's Centennial
1, This album contains the best lyrics ever!: There's so much to say about this album... Let's start with the obvious that it doesn't S**K! The tunes are so fast they'll tear the flesh from your body. The lyrics are strong
1, Deliciously Dark: This is truly one of the first masterful thrillers and an incredible psychological examination. Foiled before he can pull the trigger and bring down a vicious European dictator
1, Excellent Commentary: I found this to be a good source to supplement my preparations to teach Sunday school. However
1, Great Books of the Western World: This is another collection I have longed to find for years and years. It now sits on the shelf in my library and I look forward to a long winter of reading these treasures. Great service
0, Eg7001: Basically is a good gun. To me this is a replica made to look like the Chinese version of the Russian designed TT-Tokarev pistol during WWII. Its pretty accurate. although I modified mine with a new spring instead of the crappy copper spring it came with.Pros--cool looking for any WWII fan-good quality-shipped fast-silent when firedCons--a bit flimsy/wobbly-plastic ammo clip-saftey design. I hate the safety on this gun! if you accidently tilt this gun the wrong way it will lock on you!
1, Cool Criterion: This 2 disc criterion collection is a must have for anyone who has a movie collection and is into films of the cult and avant-garde genres. Criterion's Naked Lunch comes with a heavy 32 page booklet that contains articles on the director of the movie (David Cronenberg) and writer William S. Burroughs and more in depth information on the film and the steps it took to get Naked Lunch from book to screen. There is just too much to explain about the film but the DVD itself is a true gem in my collection. PLEASE RE-RELEASE DEAD RINGERS CRITERION EDITION!!!
0, Well...: This film is what people who masquerade as artists produce. Which accounts for much of Hollywood today. This is your film if you like pain. This film is like a puzzle that is just plain cardboard on both sides. One thing can be said for this
1, Finally!!!!: The US DVD release of perhaps the best film made in the 90's was way overdue. Although not listed in the product details
1, Where's the DVD
1, VISUAL FEAST
0," ...plastic?!: I bought this thinking that it would fit the Handspring Visor...it doesn't but that's not Franklin Covey's fault. Just beware all you Handspring owners that this won't work. I'm glad it didn't work however. It's constructed of cheap plastic and isn't very usable for 8-1/2 x 11"" planners. Yuck."
0, Functions Well - But Cheap & Flimsy: Really useful and fits well with a Plam IIIxe. BUT it is constructed of cheap material and has split apart twice and cracked in 3 different places. Get some epoxy if you buy this.
1, Ricky's best album yet: This is an incredible collection of new music and standards done with incredible love and energy. An amazing spectrum of music done by arguably the best overall bluegrass band in the world. Sis Draper is my favorite.
1, Good book
0, Could use a proofreader: We got this game because I wanted to have a fun way to help my daughter with the GeoBee. Every time we play it I find things that the editors got wrong. They left Belize completely out of the game
1, An Authentic Classic: This is a wonderful book. It shows that Bierce was a truly modern realist with a sense of humor. Bierce's definitions were pithy and funny one hundred years ago
1, Necesary for any collection: Enormously entertaining and witty. This work is quite skeptical yet realistic and any one with even the smallest collection of books should dare not exclude this. Bierce states the obvious in the most crude terms
1, The funniest
1, Ingenious Bag: Excellent
0, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS BUT THEY MESSED IT UP!: This TV show is a GREAT SHOW
0, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS WARNING ...: audio is terrible - picture quality is poor - we are disappointed
1, Sound is fine for me. Great show too.: I almost didn't buy this in Instant View based on the two reviews that stated there was an issue with the sound. I decided to risk it and so far
0, not funny: dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one!
0, not funny: A friend highly recommended this so I watched one episode. That was enough for me. The canned laughter was annoying but not as annoying as the show itself which basically is about an alcoholic fashion designer and her serious daughter. I saw absolutely NOTHING funny about this show but of course everyone is different... Now that I think about it
1, AB FAB Series 1: Love the AB FAB series with Pats & Edie; especially like Bubbles as she is such an eccentric little odd ball! Hoping for more AB FAB DVD series in the future if it is true Saunders is reviving this series.
0, The rattle with a smily face fades color: This toy is overall fun
1, LOVE the stacking and jingly ball: These are so fun! You can stack them up or put two half circles together to make a ball. I stick the smiley face inside a ball so my baby can shake it and hear the sound. I also take the half circles (not the smiley ball) for bath time as they dry fast and don't retain any water (preventing mold like the squeeshy toys attracts). They're colored and numbered so it's a great learning toy as well.
1, unbelieveable: i am a huge AC/DC fan from MESA
0, movie: love the movie. made me cry. I was expecting the original movie but it still is a wonderful story to watch
0, Terrible: You know it's bad when you can't even get worked up enough to care when the dog's die. This maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. Not true to the book
0, Cut TO pieces.: I had seen this Film previously
0, Living aboard your RV: Good book.Good shape.Fits my needs on this subject.Timely delivery.I'll probably be referring to it over the next years as we travel.
1," Eyewitness Books are the BEST!: Eyewitness vividly explains the life and times of those ""knights in shining armor"". These books not only hold the short attention span of young children"
0," Buy this book--but not this one!: Cold Comfort Farm is a wonderfully charming novel. But don't waste your money on this version! This version has been ""edited"" to Americanize it"
0," CAREFUL! It's the wrong disc: Attention: if you order this disc be extremely careful. For some reason the Pat McLaughlin has a similar UPC to ""Shining Bright"" by Rod Taylor. They are not the same. Apparently many online retailers use the same computerized lookup system and the two albums are switched. When they scan their Rod Taylor disc it comes up Pat McLaughlin ad they don't bother to verify. If you add this to your cart expecting Pat McLaughlin check closely"
0, Poor rehash of some good songs.: This is a 1991 release obviously made long before Pat found his solid clean sound. If you are a fan you will recognise a number of the songs
0, POOR SHREDDER: I just got this shredder becuase it was recommended by the one review available. The machine did not work for more than two minutes before it broke. What it did shred was done poorly. If you need a heavy duty shredder I would look somewhere else. Mine is going back.
0, Made for kids who know long words....: I watched this with my little sister
1, good: it is a good book any way.especially for demographical study and poupulation forcast.beside to that it will give me a knowlege about the subject
1, Tough trip through paradise: Gives a true to life description of life at the end of the mountain man era
1, YUM: They arrived quickly in perfect condition
1, A wonderful book
1, Very good buy!: I was very satisfied with this book. My son loved the smells and I enjoyed reading it to him.
1, Delightful Christmas Story: One of the best Christmas stories. Charming and timeless. I've been giving it as a gift
1, Childhood book: I had this book when I was a child and was sad when my book was ruined from being in the basement. I was really happy to find this book when looking for other books on here and bought it. This book is a sniff and smell book and the smells are nice!
0, shocking but not interesting: The situations described are shocking as the book promises. One big problem: you have difficulty following the stories. Written in a rather stream of consciousness style
1, PARTY ON A C.D!!!!!! THIS IS A BLOCK PARTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have never heard another cd that is this good. This blends every music genre that has ever been recorded and is jammed into a dope a$$ sound. Coming from East los angeles ozomatli really knows how to party. of course listening to the c.d is not the same as seeing one of their shows. if they ever come around to a club
1, Believe the Hype. Ozomatli is a great band!!: If all that you about Ozomatli is positive
1, GOOD LORD!! THIS IS SOME FUNKY-TIGHT-S**T: MAN! IF U HAVENT HEARD IT YET WHAT R U WAITING FOR? THIS GUYS ARE A LOAD OF ENERGY. THEIR SHOWS R THE GREATEST. THEIR IS NOT ONE PERSON STANDING! EVERYBODY SHAKES THIER ASS. THE CD IS AWESOME FROM START TO FINISH. WITH THEIR BLEND OF ALTERNATIVE-HIP HOP-RANCHERA-SALSA- CUMBIA-REGGAE-SKA-BLABLABLA THEY MIX EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC TOGETHER. WHETHER THEY R PLAYING RAP OR LATIN OR WHATEVER U CAN SURELY BET THEY WILL ROCK YOUR ASS!!!!!!!!!!!
0, Bowie finally sold himself out!: At 56 years of age
1, And you thought you had read it all: Having read just about all the books that are out regarding the 1996 Everest expedition I didn't have much hope that Dr. Weathers would have anything much to add. But I was wrong
0, Part One was GREAT....: But the rest of the book was a big yawn. I really did not feel personally involved enough with the author to read through his tedious 200+ page life story. If you are after an account of what happened on that fateful climb
0, expected more: Somehow
1," The name fits!: My wife can't help constantly calling it the ""coolaroo."" It offers a nice"
1," ""Shady Review"": I was very pleased with the Coolaroo Shade Gazebo. It was very"
0, cheap: these look as cheap as something purchased in a dollar store....the kids are getting these for Christmas let's hope they at least last...but I having a feeling they won't
0, useful for Macintoshes: Having interfaced a QWEST ActionTec wireless DSL modem
0, DP 311U does not work for me and the tech support is terrible!: I bought this DP-311U print server. I set it up according to the manual and i can print from different computers to the printer. However
0, Needs better tailoring: Although this cover was clearly designed for my BMW 328
1, Another poetic view of flyfishing: Emphasizing the feeling and beauty of fly fishing with some good
0, MOUSE LAG PERSISTS: After installing the game I found it unplayable due to mouse lag. After hours of searching
0, Short
0, LAME: Don't buy this game. You can't save except at checkpoints
1, Excellent band but the singer needs a little vocal work: One of the best devises I have ever buy. Small and reliable. Good compatibility with MacOS. Excellent compatibility with Windows XP
1, second one: Bought first in 2003
0," Disappointing: I had the Keyspan plugged into the back of my computer which is set up next to my entertainment center. I wanted to be able to control the mouse on my 46"" Samsung LCD screen from the couch"
0, Very limited value: Worked sporadically
1, Works GREAT for my needs: Bought this item for the remote mouse control; I have an HDTV connected to my desktop computer over 50ft way using an HDMI cable form [...]. With the Keyspan PR-US2
1, This is what I was looking for.: I am a High School World History Teacher and Technology Facilitator. I needed a multimedia controller that could control my PowerPoint presentation and Windows Media Player. I was looking for a controller that gave me the ability to walk around the class and control my computer from the other side of the room. The Keyspan does everything it claims to do. I can control my PowerPoint
1, Special Features: Hello
0, Desicent: this film is not that good. There is not that much of connection between this one and the first two. To much jokes from Pinhead and company. the plot isn't that well done
0, Poorest of DVD quality: I have seen this movie on VHS and it's one of the Hellraiser films that I enjoy. I liked the characters and the direction of the movie. When I watched this film on DVD last night
0, Disappointing: We bought Fodor's Ireland
1, Great Ireland Guide: Great ideas for minimizing expenses while maximizing enjoyment. Ireland is our favorite place outside of the U.S.
1, Great necklace: I love the color of the stone and how it hangs on my neck. It's a great necklace for the price.
0, I give up: Tried for three hours to set up this print server. Called tech support -- 30 minutes on hold
0, Absolute Garbage: If you're printing a page or 2 in black and white is is sometimes ok. As long as I've had it
0, Piece of JUNK: This device (both models) is a total piece of junk. Be warned. Do NOT purchase this piece of crap. It isn't worth anything unless you like frustration and an expensive paper weight. Look elsewhere.
0, I read it: But because it was for a child (girl ) perhaps another storyline would be more delicate but was not aware of Hairy Maclary I will be more careful in my choice of story lines
0, Pass on this one: I dont care how many kids you have or how long you've been programming for
0, Not for heavy use: We have three litter boxes for a number of foster cats. After about a week or so of daily scooping
1, Nothing Could Be Finer: It is such a joy to be read to and even better when James Herriot has told the tales and Christopher Timothy is the reader. This audio book collection is timeless. I can listen again and then again and never get tired of the tales.
0, WHERE IS MOLLY HATCHET?: I really don't understand why these guys named this band Molly Hatchet. There is noone from the real Molly Hatchet in it. Any former! Let me tell you Molly Hatchet is David Hlubek
1, Excellent: A co-worker introduced imogen to our business and immedaitly four of us ran out to buy it. It is that good. Imogen is a wonderful mixture of the passion and musicality of Tori Amos
1," All You Wanted To Know About The Amish: A very interesting and informative look into the history of the Amish religion. Their trials and tribulations to acheive the simple life. The way they were treated in their native country and the way that they were accepted here in America. Their fight to keep what they believe in as a way of life is awe inspiring. The way they have been treated and they can still be non- conformist and non- violent is a tribute to their religious upbringing. A very good read and an eye opener to these ""plain people""."
1, excellent replacement - good price: This valve was a perfect replacement for my failed 25 year old log-splitter valve. It works great and was American made
1, Jimmy's Blues: I never read poetry
0, once upon a texas train: good to see all those old time cowboys in this movie
1, Great book!: Working as a tutor in my college's writing center
1, Magical Christmas...: I am a big Christopher Khayman Lee Fan. When I bought this movie it was to add to my CKL movie collection. Instead
0, 2 stars for the comic aspect: I rented this for my kids and I don't think they enjoyed it. I laughed hysterically over the bad acting and the huge
1, great Read: If you are a L'Amour fan you probably won't be reading the review anyways. If you haven't read any of his books and you enjoy reading westerns you'll enjoy this one as well as any of the other Sackett books.
1, lonely men: This was bought for my father for when he is in the hspital
0, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!: Do not waste your money on this. It's very poorly made
1, YARRRRR: Now once upon a time there was a witch-. Dad
0, this thing stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: this scooter is a horrable deal. my son bought it 1 year ago and when we got it
1, Madisons mom: I bought this for my daughters 10th birthday. She loves it! I read all the reviews saying that the battery didn't last very long. But to the contrary
1, Don't insult Jordan's writing ability with a movie idea: I've read the Fallon series and the WOT series and couldn't even imagine them being deplored by a movie. Never in my life have I seen a movie that compared to the book. You wanna see a movie
0, This edition misses the point: With Shaw's plays
0, too creepy and scary for young ones: I think this is inappropriate for young kids
0, The Long Ride Home: As a western buff i almost bought this movie before i saw it
0, Half a Book: I don't know what the publisher was thinking. The spaces between the lines in the book look almost twice the size as a normal book. What has been done here is to offer a small book as a large one. It is funny that Mr. Brokaw is writing such a small book about his life. Is there nothing new to share with readers? Like bubblegum that has been elongated the book lacks flavor and zest and is really nothing more than text with Brokaw's face plastered on it. Next time Tom give us the whole story with a real book.
0, Boring: This book was written for simpletons by a simpleton. Reading from a teleprompter is not exactly brain surgery. But if you want to hear more from a self-important blowhard
1, Great CD at a great price: If you want a great little snapshot of a Rick Nelson performance you got it right here. He sings his hits and really gives it all he's got. Singing live isn't easy and he gives a very good vocal performance. Is he a gifted singer? Does he hold any notes any longer than he has to? No
1, Marketing Online Second Edition: Marcia writes from having lived the experience of marketing online to its fullest. Back in 1994 she was one of the editorial contributors to the small business bulletin board I led on the Prodigy Network. I could always count on her to keep our bulletin board community conversations lively with her witty contributions. Readers will find her writing quick to read and easy to digest.The book was revised and updated in a second edition published in 1999. There is enough new material in the second edition
0, Pale tiny print on non-white page
0, Distorted playing at begining of CD: I noticed this a while after I purchased the player and I attributed it to the CD
1, recommended by my plastic surgeon: I had a few samples of this product from my plastic surgeon and I didn't want to pay the $80 they were charging
0, Arthur - not the one I want to read: Camelot is currently one of my obsessions. So I read this in the hope that it might be more historically relevant than some of the fantasy series I've been reading. It isn't. I'd rather tackle Mallory head on. Personally
1, Good Knight: Solid reading with classic language and story telling. Thank goodness the modern authors haven't hijacked and ruined this story (yet)
1, Daily log.: This is a simple daily log of an individual. Interesting
1, Confessions : Augustine's contribution to western thought: This book may not seem very ground-breaking to modern readers who have grown up within a western culture influenced by these ideas
0, horrible: Bernard Mayes mutilates the reading of this wonderful book. He sounds like Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. His reading is just horrible. Some word pronouncements are barely audible
1, Deliciously delightful read!: From beginning to end
0," Awful -- boring and pretentious: ""The Parrot Trainer"" by Swain Wolfe is just plain awful. I kept reading"
1, Best watch ever!: I love this watch a lot. I use it all the time. I take spinning and for me its fun to know what my heart rate is so that I can be in the right zone. IT has a calorie counter
1, Timex Ironman: This monitor works for me if the monitor strip is place firmly under my exercise bra. Once it is placed
0," Side by side TV [VHS]: I bought a Side by Side TV $48.20. But I received only one tape of ""Demo Video"".As of July 27"
0, It's not funny!!!: I couldn't finish watching the whole documentary on Netflix instant play. What a waste of my time. Tom has his points but I am not buying them. How would I know he was not manipulating his weights by exercising or eating diet pills off the camera if he thinks Morgan Spurlock was manipulating his weights as well. Personally
0, Misinformed and Annoying: This film is full of misinformation and the way the narrator/creator presents it is just plain annoying. His whiny
0," Informercial for Books: You think this guy is out to disprove Super Size Me's but him and his ""experts"" were only out for a buck"
0, I couldn't get through this movie...: I would just like to say what took the filmmaker hours to film (the fat butts) I see every single day. I could have shot that montage in under ten minutes.
1, A Great Book For All Ages: If you are wanting to buy this book do it. It is a heart warming story of kids who grow up with a not so pleasing life and help there chuch with the christmas pagent
1, The Best Christams Pagant: This is a tale of 7 very bad kids. The trouble the Herdmans get into is unbelievable. They can&#65533;t be all that bad because they do go to church. By intimitation they get the roles in the Christmas Pagant. All the other kids are afraid of the Herdmans. This is a short book and an easy read. You willbe on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.
1, A Christmas gem: Anyone who has never read this book
1, The Best Christmas Book Ever: No one should go through the Christmas season without first reading this story! We love it in our family! Anyone who has experienced a Christmas pageant will laugh and cry reading this story.

0, DANGER!!!: ****I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A REVIEW UNTIL NOW.....I have been using track balls for a long time now to reduce the strain on my wrist. It seems the styles keep changing...This one looks so cool and it's BIG. Got it right away and hooked it up
1, The Best Trackball To Buy: I run six different computer systems in the lab
1, This is the best thing I have ever bought.: I toyed around with different trackballs after my wrist began to hurt from a mouse. The microsoft versions
0, Do Not Buy - No Support: I've had the Expert Mouse for a couple years. It works great on Windows XP
0, Track ball: Uncomfortable and works poorly on a MAC. Hate to say it
1, Order #2: The first one broke after 3 years. The right mouse button periodically does not register clicks. I'm pretty rough on trackballs/mice so three years is a nice lifetime. They are very sturdy and very comfortable to use.
0, Quality control is suffering; scroll ring sticks: I had one of these two years ago that worked great and is still working. My most recent purchase is okay
0, From glad to sad: A couple of years ago I would have highly recomended this product. Last year I bought a new 64 bit computer with Windows 7
1, Great product!: Great product
1, Yeah Buddy!: I just unpacked my expert mouse and my life is already better. It changed my life with in the first ten minutes of using it. I do a lot of work in Pro Tools
0, No drivers for Windows 7 or Vista: My mistake in assuming they would be up to date with their drivers.From their own website:Is Kensington planning to release Mouseworks software compatible with Microsoft Vista or Windows 7?AnswerThere are no plans to do so at this time. It is important to know that you should not install Mouseworks on any PC running Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows 7. Mouseworks was exclusively developed to run under Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows. The Control Panel for Vista and Windows 7 does incorporate some options for input device configuration such as pointer speed adjustment
0, junk: I don't know what happened to Kensington - been using their trackballs for years - now the i have lion i'm stuck with this poorly made and badly operating piece of junk
0, Running Mac Mountain Lion? Don't Buy this product!: While this is a great device
0, Vista incompatable: this does not have the Vista Compatable logo
1," Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball: My colleague suggested that I try this product based on her experience with it. She was right! Great product and I've used a lot of ""mice"". As usual"
1, OUTSTANDING CD: ROD ARGENT AT HIS BEST. THE SONGS ARE OUTSTANDING
0, Lid makes this useless: The lid just sits on top of the bucket. It doesn't snap on
0, I've wasted 10 bucks.: I love the idea of this toy BUT how is my kid supposed to benefit from sorting if the lid comes off extremely easily?! I'm seriously considering getting my money back.
1, Grandson liked it.: I got this for Christmas for our Grandson. He is one. He likes it very much.Well made and came in a timely manner.
1, Priced Right: I bought this for my one year old grand daughter. So far she just wants to dump out the box and slap the shapes around or put them in her mouth. When she goes home for the evening I put them back in the box
1, Great Entertainment for 6 months +: My daughter has had this toy since she was about six months old and loves it! She loves taking the lid off
1, Perfect little toy!: I bought a replacement one of these because the dog chewed up the handle on her first one. It is a great little toy. The rectangular bucket is a nice little size with a handle. My granddaughter plays with the shapes and puts them into and out of the bucket. My husband is teaching her to fit them through the shape holes. There is enough space in there for the blocks from both of the two sets to fit into the one bucket (threw out the one the dog chewed). Then someone else sent her the same item as a gift! We still like it! Now she has three sets of the blocks and two buckets with lids! Good toy.
1, Fun toy for baby: My 9 month old son loves playing with this. We stack up the shapes
1, First Birthday gift: Purchased this for my grandson's first birthday. I wanted to get him something not only as a learning toy but to have fun with. It's also easy to travel with.
0, Would be great if the top was not so easy to remove: My daughter likes playing with this toy
0, How to fix sorter easily.: So this sorter is okay
1, Great except for the lid.: I bought this toy when my child was an infant. He loved the bright colors and putting the shapes into the sorter.. that is until he found he could easily open the lid. From then on
1, Fun: Babies don't need much
1, Classic baby toy but ugly packaging: I ordered this as a gift - the product was as pictured
0, Whatever happened to???: I was just thinking about Pride & Glory and the first thing that came to me was: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO?Needless to say
1, So underratted it hurts!!!: Every song on this CD rocks. If you like music like Blackfoot
1, Good Introduction to Chinese Calligraphy: Chinese calligraphy is a mammoth subject with thousands of years of history. In addition
0, Didn't fit: I bought this and it didn't fit around the nano at all. I was very dissapointed as it is a nice product.
1, The ONLY lozenge for me: These things are the BEST. I don't use anything else. Sore throat at night
1, The Trilogy Comes to an End: The final book in the trilogy ties up all the loose ends. In this one
1, Excellent quality banner: This banner is made of a heavy-duty fabric which will stand up well to the winter weather. The double-sided design is just what I wanted - brightly colored and well constructed. I'm very happy with the purchase.
1, Love!!: So delicious!! These are the best rum cakes ever!! First time we ever had them was in the Bahamas. It's so good to know I can order and enjoy them anytime.
1, Read the story
0, It's coming in Oct. Why does it seem so long?: Is this book going to deal with Richard and Kahlan's child? Or with the Imperial Order?Or neither
0, Hoping for Better: Another okay novel in the Sword of Truth series. I keep thinking that I will fall for these and eagerly anticipate the next one but I'm still only mildly attached. I have a few more in the series on my shelf already so I'll keep going with higher hopes for the next one.
1," Goodkind is tops!: I have been reading fantasy since the fifth grade with Andre Norton's ""Outside."" I have enjoied authors such as Andre Norton"
0, Disappointing: As a previous reviewer stated
0, CAUTION breaks quickly and has NO warranty!: I just want potential buyers to know that the email and phone contacts listed within the warranty and on their website are invalid and I can find no other way to contact customer service to replace the mouse that broke within a month of purchase. It is supposed to be covered under warranty
1, The BEST TV show from the '80's EVER!: I just love the DESIGNING WOMEN TV show. I watched it when it ran on TV in the late 80's & early 90's. Four FUNNY! SASSY! Southern Woman.
1, A difficult read but a great book: A great book
0," Huge disappointment: If I hadn't read ""Slan"" many years ago and knew it to be one of the great works of science fiction"
1, Great Book at an unbeatable price: To own one of (IMHO) the essential books on modern logic and philosophy for FREE is fantastic. It is thick going at times
0, It dosent work with PS2 as described.: Im not casting aspersions toward the seller but the fact is this controller has never worked with games it claims it will work with.I have searched everywhere I can think of for any other directions on how to program this controller but the options are limited & so this unit is worthless as a PS2 controller.
1, wow...: Absoutely unbelievable! After I played the game
0, Low-budget endeavor: Good enough
1," classic: This is a great example of toms range--he makes it clear in this release that he is not just about one style such as drum and bass-- here he clearly explores heavy funk and jazz elements--i feel his early albums have a more jazzy feel that the album which he iscredited for being a ""jazz fusion thig which wpould be the ""rotted one note"" album-- this album is approaching electronic music not as a categorial thing but as an extension of a musical experience and i feel tom is able to make one of the most consistent artistic statements out there in relation to versatile styles."
1," Get Inside the Poker Mind Now!: The book is a classic. It is great addition to any poker library. It deals with many important issues that affect poker players today. The controversial ""AQ test"" essay alone is worth the cover price.It is written by the real deal"
0, A filler: What a disappointment! As a big fan of Jim Crace (particularly Being Dead)
1, Great book: My husband is an avid Yankee fan and bought this book for him for fathers day. He was ecstatic and reads it constantly. Great book for any baseball fan.
0, George Will Doesn't Know......: George Will is a pompous ass who knows even less about baseball than he does about politics. In this rag
0, Verbose
0, Give me a break!: If you're looking for a good baseball read
1, Language. Sex. Violence. Other?: Very good album
0, Human Behavior and the Social Environment: This book was not that helpful at all. Whenever I needed to write papers on this subject
0, amazon did their job-but this book sucks: Amazon shipped the right book and it was on time. This book
0, Waste of time and money: This is a required text for one of my BSW classes and I wish I hadn't wasted my money purchasing it. The book is not constructed in a clear way
0, Very disappointed.: Picture was not 1080p blu-ray quality. I own and watch many blu-ray and this one was more like DVD up-converted to 1080p. Maybe it's the IMAX camera
0, Predictable: Predictable after the first few chapters but the first few were entertaining and light hearted. It is a collection obviously.
1, Clever stories but not really detective fiction: Intriguing short stories featuring a man who advertises for unhappy people and fixes their lives - for a fee. Contains Case of the Middle-Aged Wife
0, Great if it worked: Installed this expansion and it caused random Sims 2 crashes. Looked the problem up on the internet and it was pretty common. Uninstalled and problems disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. I DON'T recommend this expansion.
1, If you like Sims2 you have to have this one!: I am a Sims2 fan and have all the expansion packs to the Sims2..I can say I couldn't wait to get this one and I was not disappointed at all....I truly enjoyed letting my Sims take a vacation and checking out all the fun things they had to offer on these trips...I can say anyone who didn't like this is nuts...as long as you have a good running computer you will love this game....I had no problems with this game at all and can say it was worth the money
0, No.: No.Read Beauclerk
1, Highly Recommended: This book really opened my eyes about writing programs for Office. I knew you could record little macros but I had no idea how much great custom programming is possible. I really like getting the different programs to work together. This book made it all pretty easy. It has clear explanations and the writing style is easy to read. There is lots of example code
1, awesome !: I enjoyed seeing the technigues displayed but do not know why they have to use such profane and obnoxious music 
0, Dissappointed!: I purchased this and loved it for a year. The motor stopped working just over a year after I purchased it. Which was just after the warranty was up. I only used it for the holidays
1, Authentic sound: This is one of the only CDs on the market that doesn't have that annoying background techno beat. Just pure steelpan. It sounds great!
1, Reminds me of trinidad!: I really like this cd!All I need is some rum punch and my caribbean breeze!ALL the songs are nice.
0, Remastered ....Not: Denmon Records from 1986 is the equal
1, Ahhhh!...... Rev. Al!: Al can sing. That's all you need to know. The most soulful falsetto voice out there (makes mincemeat out of Barry Gibb on 'How Can You Mend a Broken Heart')
1, Need the Ronettes T.A.M.I. appearance: I am a true Tory Blue Stones fan and received their first American album when a disc jockey. I am also a big James Brown fan
1, TAMI SHOW ON DVD: The legendary sixties concert is now available on DVD with restored footage. This is a great concert hosted brilliantly by Jan Berry and Dean Torrence (Jan and Dean) who also feature in the opening credits. Some great performances and the quality is excellent. Great value for money.
0, A Concept That Falls Flat: I was so excited for this play to come in. I expected a complex mix of the oppression of Catholic school life and the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare's most famous lovers. Instead we get what is basically the script of Romeo and Juliet with lackluster stage directions and zero characterization. There are glimmers of characters
0, Dizziness: I took only one dose of this medication (2 capsules) and soon after became incredibly dizzy
1, Netgear GA511 Ethernet PC Card: For anyone with a laptop without a built-in LAN adapter
0, disappointed elmo lover from new york: i thought this would be a great gift for 2 year olds so i bought one for my daughter and one as a birthday gift for her friend dina. well
1, Pretty good: This book was pretty good. I felt in some parts it dragged on to long. Over all a excellent book.
0, Ummmmmmmmmmmmm: Ok
1, Uglies: This story is about a girl named Tally and her new friend Shay. In Tally and Shay's world on your 16th birthday you get an extremely cool gift. No it's not your driver's license
0, Narcissistic teenage girls
1, Unexpected: This is a really good book. It was Interesting
1, Pretty ain't always Pretty: Fantastic dystopian story that had me from the first chapter. I can't imagine living in a world such as Tally's where you get a pretty operation at 16 and and you get to go live with the pretties. I mean I would really hate living in that kind of world because what one perceives as pretty is not always anothers opinion and Tally soon comes to the conclusion that the dream she has had for so long of becoming a pretty may just be a nightmare instead. I rooted for her 100% when she rebels and takes off to find her friend Shay and to discover what is beyond.... Well actually she wasn't given much choice in the matter at first as she was given the choice of giving up her friends location or never being able to become pretty which at the time was what Tally thought she wanted...it was only later she came to see that things were not all as they appeared.
1, Uglies: I loved this book. I read it in three days so it's an accomplishment for me. I don't read books very fast as all my friends will tell you. This is one of the best books I've read and it was great. I can't wait to buy the sequal.
1, Good read: This was a good read - my husband recommended it to me because he knows I like the dystopian romantic futuristic books. It was a little weird at first
0, Clunky Translation and formatting: This is a review of the free Kindle edition (with the Green and Beige cover).1. Note this is the 1919 Translation by C.K. Moncreiff
0, Don't be fooled by Amazon reviews!: I was
1, ANDREA RULES!: This book reached out to me and said yes
1," First heard it in Junior High German Class: Little did we know our very proper older-gentleman German teacher was a ""head"". To us"
0, Very unconfortable!!!!: The good thing about this hard case is that it'll protect the handheld. Those who are left-handed will have no problems
1, what a twist...: I've always been a fan of Erika Eleniak since her Playboy and Baywatch days. I think overall
1, Classic elaboration of the Dow Theory: William Hamilton was the successor (both at the Wall Street Journal and in expounding the Dow Theory) to Charles Dow
0, An unecessary defense of the stock market: The stock market barometer is a completely unecessary defense of what the stock market is. It provides an incredible amount of uninteresting and completely trivious information. It is definitely NOT a must read.
1, The caper to end all capers!: This is a big
0, Only buy this book if you sent your Autistic child away!!: I guess this is something that I feel strongly about. Because we have an autistic child who we love
1, Quirky book about living: A novel about the tangled lives of small town folks both young and old and the relationships that evolve among them. A story that brings together people from various places and stages in their lives - Amelia
1, Alice in Wonderland DVD (w/Johnny Depp): Purchased as a gift for adult daughter; a little dark
0, 1 of 5: There's nothing wonderful about Tim Burton's adaption of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland; a fantasy novel by Lewis Carroll. It's one of the most popular children's stories American culture has to offer. I remember attending a stage-play version of it back in elementary school. But I don't remember it being this bad.This is a movie without a clear plotline. The visuals; the costumes and set designs that make-up Wonderland; are artsy and imaginative. That's one thing a Tim Burton presentation virtually guarantees. But the story
0, Not 3D all the time...: Not so great 3D
1," GENIOUS - PURE GENIUS! - BONHAM CARTER!!!!!!!!: This IS HELENA BONHAM CARTER's show! She gives us a total 3 dimensional Queen - with the ""haps"" and ""sads"" and ""funnies"" with just a little touch of Better Davis? Perhaps the rings"
0, Not impressive in any way.: There are very few reviews of this so I thought I'd add my two cents worth. I received this movie in the Sony 3d starter kit with my Sony 3d television. Maybe I expect too much but I wasn't very impressed with the 3d quality of this movie. 3d quality
0, Bad Movie: This movie is one of the worst i have seen. If it hadn't been for that i Watched it in 3D
0, Poor connection off and on during the movie: The movie kept getting blurry off and on during the movie-- we thought it was our connection but I suspect it had to do with Amazon. We've rented from them before with good results
0, A shame.: What a disappointment. I mean... Tim Burton+Alice In Wonderland should = genius
1, Back to Wonderland: Johnny Depp gave one of his best acting performance as the Mad Hatter. He brought life to a deep charactor. Well done Mr Depp. This movie was enchanting. The special effects were well done. Alice played by Mia Wasikowski now 19 years returns to the magical world of Wonderland. By returning to wonderland she meets some of old and new charactors. This is must see for Johnny Depp fans.
1, An Okay Marriage Greatly Improved: When a friend gave me this book 13 years ago
0, Ugh.: Bought this at a local market
1," The future is already here: In reading the Parables I couldn't help but think that the science fiction label put on these novels is entirely inaccurate. Butler's ""future"" is already here -- the walled communities"
0, Waste of Money: The pillowcase was the wrong size and only covered about 1/3 of the pillow. There was also no return order form in the package
1, High Hopes: My son's teacher has exactly the same opinion as the reviewer that wrote High Hopes Dashed. I have hopes that my son can have his learning differences accommodated in a regular education classroom as opposed to being taught by an aide in the Resource Room. Under IDEA and 504 it is his right. Mel Levine's book will help parents and students understand some of the learning differences that need to be accommodated.
1, A wrong made right.: Ordered this for a coworker for an xmas present about 2 weeks before xmas. Waited on it to arrive but it never did. Emailed amazon and they shipped out another set that I was able to get before xmas and give to my coworker. Awesome customer service. She really enjoyed the present.
1, Very Good book on critical areas: this book deals with the critical leadership skill of seeking competent
1, A MUST READ book about a history that haunts us today: All of our Asian issues (China
1, Timeless comedy: My brother and I loved this when we first saw it when we were kids
1," Funniest Live Comedy Concert Ever Taped: I know there are those who won't agree with me about the ""funniest ever"" label because of the Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy concerts caught live"
0, Crap: The DVD didnt work. I've seen this before and its hilarious but whoever manufactured the DVD put out a terrible product. I threw it away having never watched it.
1, Classic: This classic performance was just as entertaining this time as it was all those years ago when it first came out. The jokes were clean and the material is hilarious if you are a parent.
1, Why Aren't there More of These?: Bill Cosby is a timeless comedian
1, Great Entertainment: Enjoyed this so long ago
1, A classic: Should be seen by all parents to be. It also pays back for empty nesters. Fun without 4 letter words
1, Simple yet complex: As other reviewers have noted
1, GREAT FOR ANYONE: This is great for anyone especially those who want to try to eat vegan. It is simple with variety of options offered for each created dish! This is a keeper.
1, This movie kinda creeped me out: I'm not sure if I think this movie was completely over the top or not. I spent most of it with my eyes covered
1, Puts most American vengeance films to shame: Like his previous film
0, verbal diarrhoea: the content was fascinating and definately worth reading in hard copy form
1, Inspirational Introduction to Will Durant: This was my first introduction to Will Durant and it did not dissapoint. It was a very quick and easy read as well as being both a great historical refresher and a great insight into the mind of this legendary figure. The book includes top ten lists of the greatest thinkers
1, Funny
0, I'm so disapointed :(: My parents own 2 copies of the LP version of this album. I've listened to it FOREVER. I bought it thinking it was the version that I had grown up with. It isn't...If you've EVER listened to the LP version
1, A cherished memory.: After seeing the original TV special
1, Cute
0, Don't get Laserlight Version - Buy the CUTOUT Version: I loved
0, Very Disappointed: Your description of this title states it was released in 1979...however it does not have three songs that were on the 1979 release..don't understand and was very disappointed.
1, john denver & the muppets
1, Classic: I had this album on cassette tape when I was a child
1, God's Gift to Women: God's Gift is a page-turner. I found the authors raw
0, Not As Good As His Other Books: I just couldn't get into this book. Not as good as his other two. The antics of the woman stalking him just didn't draw you in. I wasn't impressed.
1, A REAL THRILL: Out of all of Michael Baisden books
0, Awful: This book is filled with incorrect spelling
0, Deplorable (...): A further proof of the dumbing down of our society are this entire series. It is a shame and a disgrace that ever such as these were needed. For those who can't follow the text I suggest you get the Folger series. The only real problem with understanding Shakespeare would be the ancronistic words. The Folger series
1," long but interesting.: whats nice about this book is that they actually have the answers in the back. even to the silly questions. so its a fun and funny way to pick up some trivia. i think the only thing my son has picked up thusfar is the ability to pronounce the word ""zozzfozzel"". hillarious."
0, Thin plot
1, Best cancer book I read: I spent all of 1999 dealing with breast cancer. Aside from Dr. Susan Love's Breat Book
0," One of the Worst Sequels of alll time!!: It was very much anticipated after the success of ""Westworld"" that this movie would be just as good as the original. Sorry to say that it doesn't do any good! Yul Brenner is only in this movie for about 2 minutes"
0, Painfully written; a disappointment: I enjoy Jerry Lawler as a tv commentator on wrestling... his sophomoric character can add to the circus atmosphere. But not hundreds of pages of it. Too many references to his high school buddies. Cornball humor is one thing
1, The U.S. Funk Mob at its finest: Every Funkateer should own this album. This is perhaps Funkadelic's most commercial album. Much of their earlier material appeared almost experimental in nature
0, Mixed FORMULA.: If you like movies to be loud
0, Clearly Worships its Idols
1, See This Movie!: There were special showings of this movie in Tom Mercer's home town. I have been fortunate enough to see it a couple of times before the DVD is released. What a thought-provoking film: Where should the line be drawn between personal liberty and national security? The film was scary also: I can see where our country is headed if we citizens don't pay attention to what our government is doing and keep it from going overboard. The plot of the film is compelling: it draws you in and holds you until the very end.Each time I've seen the film I've noticed something I didn't notice previously
1, PCI card: I received this card in a very short time. I unwrapped it from the mailer. Couldn't be more pleased with the price and the item. Thanks very much.Henry Geuvens
1, I Remember Sandy: I remember many of the cuts on this album when they were newly released. It's amazing
0, rotten customer service: Do not buy a Buslink product unless you know you will never need customer support. They do not return e-mail
0, Arsene Lupin: The book itself is just a plain piece out of a copy machine. Not even mentioned the copy right and who is the translator. I was cheated. This item is an identical copy of the other that I purchased. Amozon should be more careful about its book seller. The seller did not even got the title right! And let us spent $9.95 for a junk in the same order shippment.
0, Keeps slipping off: Shoe looks great and is comfortable. But it keeps slipping off. I tried the heel grip things but my feet slide in and my foot keeps sliding out. I got these on sale too and I could not return them. Shoe is great but what is the point if you can't wear it?
1, AMAZING SHOES!: Good Morning! I bought these for my Birthday Weekend
1, Fantastic: A real winner and good Bluegrass sampler. Ricky is a fine mandolin player and has the backup of Kentucky Thunder. With this album
0, Nero Wolfe takes on Academia: A rather simplistic mystery from Goldsborough
1, devout rocker hooked: being a devout rocker/metal head since the age of 8
1, Kubrick's Best: and the only film he ever made that truly has withstood the test of time. While his brooding pretentiousness got the better of him through the '60's until his death--this film is an honest and straightforward Hollywood movie in the best since of the word.
1, Paths of Glory: I received this DVD in a reasonable time
1, 3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:A classic war film
1, KO: I just got done watching aFANTASTIC movie. And I don't use thatword lightly. It's PATHS OF GLORY
1, A great record: Wallington live at the Cafe Bohemia has always been one of my favorites. I had it on vinyl and then on cd on OJC as well as this release. I am grateful that the Spanish pirate company found other songs that were not on the original OJC disc. I wish that OJC put out all of the music on their own disc. Wouldn't we all rather have the original tape from which to make the disc?Anyway
1, A ton of Spanish literature - excellent for introductions: This book is excellent for the classes that are introduction to Spanish literature. I wish I would have known about this book several years ago before I put myself through all that torture of learning on my own. With this book
0, Very Basic and Naieve Book: I bought this book hoping to find a good reference in accounting information system with a focus on processes
0," ""Whisper His Name"" is not up to Thornton's other books.: I used to say"
0, The worst Savatage album.: Let's be sincere to ourselves: this is the worst Savatage album. It looks like Poison and Dokken. There's not one great song. Period.
0, Every great band has a less-than average album: Fight For The Rock was Savatage's attempt to reach a more main-stream audience and their music suffered accordingly. Normally
1, Not As Bad As Alot Complain It To Be: While most people agree that Fight For The Rock is NOT Savatage's most well recieved album and is only for die-hard fans
0, Poor performance: I have used the IRock in Los Angeles and I have to say that it performed very poorly. The four FM channels it broadcasts over are susceptible to cross interference by other channels. I had to switch between the four available channels every 30 minutes or so! Sometimes it was every 5 minutes!Very disappointing :-( I rather use the cassette adapter I already have since performance to me is much more important than going wireless.
0, Didn't work with my MP3 player: I picked this little gadget up because it claimed it was a univeral music adapter.Well
1, Works for me...so far...: It's working for me. Only thing is that I often have to mess with it to get my car to pick up the right channel signal
0, waste of money: I only wish I'd looked over some of these reviews before going out and buying this little gizmo. It seemed to work fine for me
0, Get an iTRIP instead --: Threw this away and got an iTrip instead - it's the size and shape of a very large vitamin and takes NO batteries. Brilliant!!
0, Not a good design: The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters
0, poor reception: poor transmission quality and difficult to swap around to different channels while trying to drive at the same time.
1, corn cutter: Have only used it once and it wasn't my favorite tool. I have to use it more to get the hang of it I guess.
0, Lee's Wooden Corn Cutter: I bought two of these and they both went out in the trash with the corn cobs. Grabbed a knife and did much better without them.
0, Good only for cream style corn: This works only to cut cream style corn off the cob. If you want whole kernels
1, GOOD: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY DDP KIT AND I HAVE A WATER PURIFIER SO I CAN DROP A TAB IN MY WATER AND DRINK IT WITH NO WORRIES
1, Product true to listing: Product arrived as listed and sealed in original packaging. I have not used the items since these are being utilized in an emergency bag but they are well within the recommended usage date.
0, Doesn't play.: I ordered this DVD for my AP English class. We had just finished reading the play and I thought seeing it would be helpful. The DVD won't play on my DVD player in class so I tried using the laptop. It still wouldn't play because it had some sort of anti-copying block on it. Since I wasn't trying to copy it
0, Too tiny
1, What a run!: This is one fun ride! The movie follows a group of people as they scurry around the country trying to get to a mailbox containing 2 million dollars. The characters are fantastic
1, Just see it!: You know how when there are only a few people in a theatre
0, Free associations from a childish mind: Cynical and sad
0, Shockingly UNfunny: One of the most disappointing movies I've ever wasted a couple hours of my life on. I love Cleese and Atkinson; however
0, Terrible: This is one of the worst comedies I have seen. Only Americans will like it
0, Not very funny: This is really not worth the 1 1/2 hour investment. I just didn't think it was funny nor did anyone else in my house
1," More Evidence Proving They Were Groovilicious: If you're a Style Council fan you must own this album. Phony musicians stink when recorded live but The Style Council sounded even better live than in the studio (""Home and Abroad"" is also a necessity). This disc spans several years and features covers of some soul gems along with their own songs. They groove so hard on One Nation Under a Groove"

1, Best baseball book ever: I enjoyed reading Ball Four so much that I contacted Jim Bouton and conducted an interview with him. Take a look at my website.
0, Ball Four: I thought it was very funny when I first read it
1, i amazed: I picked up the dirty old thumbed copy from a salvalion army op shop for 30 cents. It looked like all the pages were bent but they had been carfully turned over to mark some of the jokes many years before. I started reading. It was not just a collection of jokes but a beautifully researched and systematic approach. It is to jokes what the oxford dictionary is to the language. It suprising the change since it was written as amongst my friends many of the jokes are not well known and clearly others have technological adaptation. the suprising issue is how things have changed culturally since it was written. One wonders if menstral jokes for example are shared within lesbian social groups that would be taboo in other company or if the degree of ethnic jokes that are no longer promulgated in polite company have their early source listed here. If the porice was right I would like copies for my friends
0, too heavy: I am nearly finished with this book
1, Amazing 
0, a confusing deliberately contrived book: The reviewers of this book have not been honest .There is nothing to praise.A struggling prose
0, Deeply Flawed: This is another overwritten
0, Sad to Consider: It is sad to consider the true literary greats never honored with a Nobel and then see a writer of such limited talent and intellect so rewarded. This novel is particularly pedestrian
0, never again!!: my assignment was...write a 16 page literary analysis...no specifications about author
0," Can the Nobel Prize be withdrawn?: I was assigned ""Paradise"" for a class at Colgate University. I wonder now if the professor had read the book prior to putting it on the sylabus. Who can follow a story that has no sort of time while following characters that necessarily lack development"
1, The New Meditation Handbook: I love this book - it is clear in explanation and easy to understand. I recommend those who are not sure about how to meditate to read this book which will be helpful at all times. Excellent!
0," Cabaret: The 2003 DVD re-release of Cabaret is just a re-packaging of the original DVD. Though the new package details state that it is ""enhanced for 16 x 9"
1, Cabaret Blu-ray Restoration: Just a word or two about this Blu ray release of Cabaret....there seems to be a divided group regarding the reviews. I would say that this is a major improvement over the DVD release which was infamously bad....The blu ray transfer is really wonderful. It has a soft but very detailed image. The grain of the original film is still visible which is just how it should be. There are many dark scenes in the movie
0, Movie was great
1, All in all
1, Upbeat
0, Story Has No Wings: James Cagney plays yet another cocky tough guy needing to get knocked down a peg or two (or three). He joins the Marine Air Corps on the encouragement of his Marine buddy Pat O'Brien. Cagney is a terrific flyer who thinks he knows it all
0, DVD arrived broken: The dvd arrived broken in 2 pieces and I had to send it back. I got a refund and had to order another one and I got it new (more expensive) and from someone else.
1, The best Twilight ever: This was an excellent movie. I loved this movie from the very beginning and will buy this. I am not into the books
1, Well-Done: I have no opinion. However
1, Good: This series was alot better than I thought it would be. Not the norm for vampires and I will always say that vampires DONT glitter but still a good series.
0, No just no: I bought this as a gift for my fiance. Sadly she actually likes the twilight series. I tried watching
1, Eclipse: Love the book and love the movie. This video is the closest yet to the book from the series.
1, Great product at a great price: Excellent
0, Love the Twilight series but...: I'm just disappointed that Amazon lowered it's price for both Eclipse and Twilight the day after I placed my order. I could have saved me a solid $5!However
1, LOVE THIS MOVIE: LOVE THIS MOVIE AND BOOKS I WOULD BUY IT OVER AND OVER NO FLAWS IN MINE EXCEPT IT IS LETTERBOX INSTEAD OF FULL SECREEN. DID NOT KNOW THAT AND YOU CAN WATCH IT IN FRENCH.
0, Awful: Weak unbelievable acting by the entire cast
0, Good Action
0, Still a very slow moving film: I was smart to rent this in stead of buying. I keep hearing about how each movie is getting better than the next. Not in my experience. I'm sticking to reading the books on this series as the movies are a great waste of time. This one didn't hold my attention at all. I just rented it because I couldn't find anything else on tv to watch. Needless to say that didn't help as I didn't even finish watching this one due to how boring it was.I highly recommend people rent these Twilight movies before buying (unless you can buy them for the price of a rental fee)
0, Where is my DVD?: I'm an amazon prime member and I'm STILL WAITING for my DVD - Why should I bother with Amazon when I could have bought it at Walmart days ago????
0, Twilight Eclipse: While the movie seems to be perfectly good
1, BEST OF THE THREE!: I will be honest
1, Great Movie: If you have seen the first two movies you must see this one. Seen it in the theater
0," Deceptive advertising on bd + DVD combo: Ok on the back of case it states ""...6 part documentary viewable in both standard and picture in picture modes""actually on the DVD side - nothing except 2 commentaries and summit - blu Ray isn't standard so what's the meaning of that ?No digital copy - no documentary on the DVD side :(Great movie - horrible release this time around"
1, guilty pleasure: This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine and I quickly marathoned it with the other movies upon receiving it.
1, Great movie but....: I love the movie and the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because Amazon has this listed as Widescreen edition and the one I received is standard. I REALLY HATE STANDARD!
1, Easy returns
1, Good: This book was an exciting twist I think that it was an excellent sequel and I can't wait for the third!
0, A review: This is an awesome book but needs some major editing. Great plot and amazing writing but like I said has some big typos.
1, Twists and Turns Galore!: Pretties
1, Plus One Star: Darn tecnology won't let me give this book six stars! I loved it even more than Uglies
1, Pretties: I liked this book. This book made you think about what was really important the way we look on the outside or the inside.
1, Amost AMAZING: I love the book pretties I just wished it had a different ending.I stayed up one whole night just to read this book I couldn't stop myself from finshing it.I can 't wait to read the next one.
0," Very slow: The book uglies was pretty good. Now I am almost done with pretties and it is very very boring. I have gotten very annoyed by the use of the word ""bubbly"" and ""bogus"". They are used much too often. The book is very slow. I have not liked this book at all."
1, Valley of Vision: This book is so very good. Please read and enjoy. If you need a lift and want someone to understand please get this book.
1, Robert Matheny: This is a must have devotional book for any Christian. The writers had a heart for God
1, Inspiring Work: This is the best book of prayers that I have read. It is inspiring and revealing. It can be used as a daily devotional or as a primer to get your mind ready for prayer. It also reveals the mind set of those that were inspired to write the prayers. Over all a must have for anyone who is serious about prayer.
1, Powerful prayers: Excellent Biblical heartfelt prayers. Lovely presentation. Much appreciated gift for Christian friends.Could be an appropriate gift for 1st Communion
1, FIVE stars...and you can DANCE to it!!: The more I get old and years go by
0, Haphazard info - trying to make sense of it is difficult: There is no doubt lot of info presented
1, i'm sure it's great but....: i'm just irritated because i bought the CS software package about 2 months ago and was really thrilled to actually be on top of my upgrades. alas
1, Love It!: My son loves this movie and so do I. A cartoon has to be really good and entertaining for a child and an adult to go from liking a pig to loving the entertainment that Charlotte's Web provides
0, Great stuff!: This is perfect for making ice tea. Blends well with the hot tea and then they cool to perfection! I use one squeezed lemon
1, Great solution for traveling: It is a nice looking box
1, Awesome mailbox: Had one of these at my last house
1, as described: Looks great
1, awesome: I got two of these and they look great and have exceeded my expectations. Solid wood with a nice finish. They are not that wide but that's what I wanted. They could go into an expensive beach house no problem. They have a nice open look and make my room look more contemporary. It's perfect for framed pictures
0, Disappointed: I was disappointed by this. I bought this over a set of shelves being sold in my local store because I was looking for a taller shelf unit. I wish now I had bought and stacked 2 units from my local store
0, Mission : Seek and Destroy: Hey guys
0, Not at all this color: the ring that I got doesn't look ANYTHING like this picture...the enamel portion is BEIGE..the stone in the middle is a flat brownish/pink color..there is nothing PURPLE on this ring and it looks NOTHING
0, Their worst by far: With the exception of John Weathers' blissfull song 'Friends' there is not a good track on this CD. It is filled with tired half rock songs. Musically they were totally lost. Incredibly they manged to recover from this disaster to produce the much more listenable rocker 'Civilian'. Gentle Giant were never a good rock band though. Stick to early stuff to find what they really about.
1, Two Green Thumbs Up!: Greenlit is a documentary that opens your mind about waste and the film industry. Being one of the biggest moneymakers in the world
0, The second star is for the production design...: I was horrified by this remake of William Castle's 1960 film. The characters are weak
0, Nothing New!: In my opinion
0, Tired of Racisim in Pop Culture: While viewing this film I could not help but be offended by the way the character of the family babysitter was written. They wrote the character to be a black female who wanders around with a stupid expression making stupid choices while being the one who hammers out the profanity and the one liners as comic relief. Why do movie producers feel this kind of depiction of blacks in film is okay? There are quite a few scenes in this movie that are so sterotypical it is almost sick
1, A Good Scary Movie!: Special effects are great. Story line starts out really well then turns into the typical haunted house horror flick. I definitely think it is worth renting and I ended up buying it used. Some of the death scenes are pretty realistic and gruesome. There is a little biography of each ghost on the special features of the DVD
0, Plenty of gadgetry
1, It's an ode to music: Without doubt the best wwf cd yet. There have been flops
1, This CD is the best!: WOW! That's what you'll say when you listen to this CD. It's got a variety of wrestlers themes and the best thing is it's a CD! The CD is very cool and the best is definetly number 6. I hope you enjoy it!
1, A Damn Good CD....And That's The Bottom Line: The WWF is the leader in wrestling action today
0, This was a horrible CD: This had songs that got boring after the first time you heard it.Don't buy it it's horrible
1, D-Generation X!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: A must buy. Put it in the CD player in the locker room before a game
1, BUTTKICKIN THEMES: This is the third installment of WWF music
1, WWF Volume 3 gave a stunner to all the previous sucky cds..: This cd rocks all the previous and so called wrestling cds. Get rid of Sable
1, DEEZ NUUTS!!: This album was great!! The Rock
1, Great game!! Could use better songs though.: Just last month
1, Good Game: Great game
1, Great party game: This is a very fun game. Personnally I think it has better songs than GHs 2 or 3
0, BE CAREFUL!: I ordered this set in early January - after the recall
1, UNBELIEVABLE!!!: what can i say --- anybody who was a fan of Christopher Reeve and the original Superman movies MUST GET THIS COLLECTION.spectacular extras include all the Fleischer Superman cartoons as well as Superman II
1, Superman Superset: One of the best box sets ever put together for a film series
0, I'd wait a little longer to buy this.: 1. A couple of the discs are missing material. They play fine but Warner forgot to put some bonus stuff on them. They are replacing the discs but you have to mail them back. So I would just wait a little while longer to buy.2. The case they come in is total garbage. My case was broken in under 5 minutes. The binding completely fell apart and the discs fell out. So if you actually want to watch the movies buy something else to put them in because Warner WILL NOT replace the junk case the put the movies in.
1, Super Collection!: For the price I got it at
0, DO NOT BUY THIS SET!: Statement from Warner Home Video
0," A little more than just elevator muzak...: Your best bet is to pay a little more and get a compilation fromthe Capitol Lounge series. This is primarily a mish mash of ""has beens"" not even on the top of their game. The only true spark of life hear is track #13 with Mae West babbling on during""Picado"". You'll be playing this disc for back"
0," Review of Gettysburg DVD: The DVD arrived damaged. I returned it for a ""refund"" which was handled quickly. The movie itself was very good until it would no longer play."
0, too long: gettysburg on both tv
0, Not so good movie: A momentous occasion such as Gettysburg deserves better. Hmm
1, The Editor's Cut is Fabulous: While the theater release of GETTYSBURG was very well recieved
1, Accurate and enthralling: I'm going to be visiting Gettysburg in a couple of weeks
1," ""Tastefully done"" battle scenes--an oxymoron and an affront.: Although one of our fellow Amazon customers has praised this film for its ""tastefully done battle scenes"" which are to be commended for lack of blood and gore"
1, Gettysberg: This is another Ted Turner masterpeice.I've seen this movie many times and I'm amazed how well it is done.In a way it's like being there.It's hard to imagine swo many Americans being killed in a 3 day battle.Martin Sheen played Lee and did a incrediable job.The entire show is well casted from top to bottom and interesting througout.A Must have .Gilbert Campagna
1, this is one of the best movies ever: this movie shows the triumph and tradegy of those 3 days in July when America's future depended on what side won. It is a very acurate potrayal of the Civil War and is deffinatly a must have for Civil War buffs
1," Not just Entertainment!: This movie can be described in two words: simply brilliant! The movie based upon Michael Shaara's novel ""The Killer Angels"" is very well interpreted and expressed. Very moving and patriotic"
1," ""We should'a gone around to the right..."": Buffalo Hood's lines as he lies in a soup of blood after the repulse at the Devil's Den rings in my mind"
1," Best Civil War movie out there!: The book ""Killer Angels"" is awesome and the movie Gettysburg does it justice. Yea it's long"
1, Excellent edition of the complete works: If you want the complete works on a budget
0, Reader
0, I must agree: I must agree with the reviewers who rated this volume so low because of the lack of footnotes. I remember being introduced to the individual Arden copies when I was acting in college - the footnotes were SUPERB
0, Shoddy
1, Clássico do Ratos: Esse album é muito pesado. Uma mistura de grind core com metal e hardcore. Acho Carniceria Tropical o melhor disco do Ratos. Pra quem gosta de som pesado
1, Awesome series!: Producers and network had a major brain fart cancelling this show. They should of resolved the writer's dispute sooner and kept this alive. Very well done series
1, Wonderful Show Gets Terminated: T:SCC is just another example of how far tv has fallen. Its down to simple minded programers trying to please equally dim witted viewers. Any show that pushes the envelop or encourages intelligent discussion is either canceled or has its budget slashed. SadT:SCC is a beautifully acted drama centered in the Terminator universe. While the plots can be hit or miss
1, Its Tight: Have been watching all the promos on fox for the upcoming season 2 and it just looks awsome
1," ""Darn"" them for canceling this series"
1, 2nd Season was better than the 1st: I would buy this 2nd season of TSCC....if I hadn't already found it at Wally World for $20. I think the second season was even better than the first
0, Horrible Ending.: I watched this series it wan't great but it was fun - until the final episode. The ending made this whole series quite disappointing and unworthy of the Terminator Franchise.In the final episode John time travels
1, Terminator Fans!: If you're a fan of the Terminator series
0, Lots in common with vacuum cleaners . . .: Oh
1, worth adding to your collection: i attended high school with three of the band members and although we were not close friends we all knew each other. i remember barry and chris were always playing around with a tape recorder every chance they got.they were fun loving
1, Through Different Eyes: Peter Dickinson has written a wonderful little book which takes a look at over thirty Old Testament stories or characters as seen through different eyes. A particular favorite of mine is a Babylonian drill sergeant using the David and Goliath story to tell young recruits how do deal with the threats posed by a slingshot to an armored infantryman. All of the stories take a different viewpoint than is used in the Bible and cast new light on the characters and situations. Quite enjoyable.
0, Boring: I was disappointed in this recording. A lot of it sounds like just a cacophony of finger exercises. True
1, ease of ordering for son: I ordered this DVD as a present for my son. He told me exactly what he wanted
1, This is the MOVIE up in this PIECE!: This was a great flick. Hands-down
0," ""King Kong ain't got nothin on me"" -Oscar worthy?????: Are you kidding!! Continuing the trend of showing how out of touch the Academy Awards is with quality cinema these days"
0, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY: THE worst! Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre. Fuqua's uninspired directing turns this movie into a typical made-for-ghetto blaster. The corrupt-cop genre has been done better MANY times before. As for Oscar
0," What's that smell? Oh . . . it's cheese.: This ""film"" was a painful experience from start to merciful finish. This movie was Copland"
1, delivers everything it should: I watched this because Eva Mendes is in it. I may be the only person willing to admit it
1, Denzel at his best: Trainig Day is a great crime movie. Denzel Washington does his best performance of his career playing Alonzo. Alonzo takes a young rookie officer
0, A complete waste of time: A friend loaned me his DVD copy. It was a waste of my time and his money. This movie is just one more reason NOT to watch the Academy Awards. There is absolutely nothing stellar about Denzel's performance. It may be different from his usual roles but it is certainly not a difficult role. Any B grade actor would have sufficed. I've read that Gary Sinise and Bruce Willis both turned it down. I guess Denzel's rent was overdue......not just overdue
1, Good movie: I like the way the movie slowly reveals Denzel's character's dark side. He goes from being a tough guy in the beginning to being a total psycho but the end of the movie. And the ride the take you on is crazy. Denzel Washington as usual does some great acting. Ethan Hawke's portrayal of a wet behind the ear narco is top notch. I love the cameo by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre also.
1, Good movie worth the buy: I saw training day in the theaters the week of release
1, Excellent Movie: Denzel's character is a far cry from the good guy image that he normally plays. (He deserves an oscar for that
1, A very funny contemporary romance: I loved this book. It is a great romance written with a lot of humor. The female love intrest
0, old part: Part ordered and sent was right number but wrong part new update cap is tan with white ring received tan with black ring call 254-582-2548 if you have any questions
1, Just what I was looking for: This item is exactely what I ws looking for after my old one of 20 years finally cracked and died. Took a while to find one in leather and at a good price. I am very satisfied. Recommend to other men looking for just a money holder and not a heavy clip.
1, Great wallet: Just what I needed? Slim with enough credit card slots. A must for men who want to place their financial needs in order.
0, Movie Quality...Bad!: The movie was funny and I liked it
0, BAD
0, WANDERLUST: This was not an enjoyable movies. Sex and story line was not the type of movie I would like my adult family memeber to see. What ever happen to the nice clean movies where you don't have to hear bad language or see ever body part?
0, Wanderlust: All right folks if you decide to view Wanderlust be prepared for dissapointment. This movie has all the components to be a good flick. You have two super hot female leads in Jennifer Aniston and Malik Ackerman
0, Wonderlost: What a let down. What a waste of talented funny actors. What a terribly unfunny film. What terrible screenwriting. Unwatchable.
0," Just don't: I didn't like it. I saw that other reviewers said this movie wasn't for the ""prudish"". I would take this further to say it's not for people with morals or expectations of a storyline/character development.The storyline seemed to be thrown together. The characters were not fully developed and consequently the plot seemed juvenile.There were several scenes where the director let the scene take much longer than it should have...Paul Rudd psyching himself up"
0, Poor Quality: The video quality for this was awful
0, DONT RENT IT!!!: I LOVE inappropriate/FUNNY movies but this one is DISGUSTING!! there are some things that you cant unsee. DONT BUY IT OR RENT IT!!
0, big names but not that good: The movie was very strange but did get better at the very end. The comedy must've not been my style but I usually can do just any type of comedy.
0, Avoid!: Not funny
1, DESPITE ITS NON-KUBRICK ENDING
1, Windshield cover working as summer cover: This cover is doing the basic cover job I needed this summer for my RVon a Ford 350. The suction cups work in the heat of the summer althoughsome previous reviewers wrote that they didn't work for the winter. I dowish that the cover was a bit wider top to bottom to completely cover fromthe top of the windshield to the grill work below the windshield wipers. I don't know how well this thin cover would hold up to winter's heavy ice/snow conditions but all I wanted was to protect the windshield when my RV is parked for prolonged periods. For the price
1, Best Ever!: I rate it five stars
1, WELL ROUNDED CONCERT: Listen to and watch it once
0," Remember those K-tel albums?: If you like the Beatles you might not like what has been done to their music on this album. I liken it to one of those K-tel brand album collections where you get hit songs sung by someone other than the original recording artist. Yes this is the Beatles but they are ""one off"" - you'll know what I mean when I hear the album.I know that is the point but it could have been so much better rather than the ""Disneyfied"" approach they took. I believe that others have done more with the music (with less cooperation from EMI). Ultimately a CD that is doomed to collect dust."
0, Why
0, Not for Beatles fans: If your a Beatles fan your not going to like this as it remixes so many of the songs together
0, Unadventurous and very disappointing.: For a long time
0, Save Your Money- Don't Buy It: Absolutely abysmal CD. The remaining Beatles should sue. It was a stretch to give this item one star.
1, love cd is awesome: The work done by father and son Martin team is amazing. This really makes the music alive and new.
1, interesting... is it necessay?: I am a Beatles fan. Always have been . But I wonder whether this was a necessary trip. Yes It takes several songs
0, The Beatles F.U.B.A.R.: I'm an original die-hard Beatles fan
0, Doesn't fit the title: Not what I thought it would be
1, Go see the show!: Just go see the show...it's really great
1, LOVEd It: It seems as if the Grey Album may have been the inspiration for this- but what the heck! What makes this album nice is that with a little creative editing
1, it's ok: It's not really Beatles as never heard before.It is
0," what a disappointment: i bought this because of the many good reviews and also because of hearing how it is the first ""official"" remix of beatles music. but listening to it was a big let down. this is at best just a beatles best of album which tries to be as mainstream as possible. and at worst a combination of beatles and andrew lloyd webber. to call this a mashup or remix puts those styles in shame. there is absolutely no originality"
0," Anthology: I bought the CD as a reaction to the movie ""Across the Universe"" and because I had heard a few cuts at a friend's house. After the novelty wore off"
1, The Beatles Love: Great job on mixing many of the beatles hits. Love to listen to this while I am driving. Seems to have a great deal of energy
0, Music OK But Second Disc is Blank: The first CD set I received had a blank 2nd disc. I sent it back for replacement and the 2nd disc on the replacement is also blank. Obviously a bad batch. Amazon isn't going to replace this one for me but will issue a credit.
0, Beatles Love CD+ Audio DVD: OK so it says clearly AUDIO DVD
1, A BEATLES REUNION--------------FOREVER MORE!!: This CD is beyond words. The beginning with BECAUSE sounds like a celestial choir ocapella and only gets better. As pretty as the song BECAUSE is in original form
0, Poor quality: This was a gift for my 3 year old nephew. He pulled the string once and it never went back in! I would not recommend. It is not very well made.
1, love at first sight: My son absolutely loves this woody doll he was Christmas best gift. The only thing about woody that I don't like Is his hat does not stay on
0, worst toy ever: i ordered this toy as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old son
1, A great toy for a Toy Story fan: I was worried about the quality of this Woody doll when I read the reviews
1, Woody the Man!!: My son who is 7 yrs. old
1," Excellent: Great size.One of the best toys a child could get especially a fan of Toy Story. Real talking Woody and looks identical to the movie character. Details are great especially the name ""Andy"" written at the bottom of his boot. Wonderful toy."
1, Love Toy Story: My son loves Toy Story 1-3 and it only made sense to get the talking Woody doll. He absolutely loves it! Woody says several phrases with his pull string (which thankfully is very short and easy to pull) He also recognizes if his hat is on or off which is kind of hilarious.
0, HELLLOOOO PEOPLE WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!: Why the people doesn`t look at ingredients? i dont know if u care or not
0," Who is this guy BOE?: I am not sure who this character ""Jeremy Boe"" thinks he is. Has he ever heard TD's music? Has he ever actually seen the movie Flashpoint? Or any movie for that matter? Where is Bedford NY for goodness sakes? Must be under a rock somewhere in the middle of the desert that he describes."
1, realistic
0, Updates Pleases!: This book is in bad need of updating. If I had known
1, Great: The actual part of the book that is the Mabinogion is a wonderful translation/adaptation/etc. The only thing that might be hard to get by is the forward and introduction
1, Name those names
1, a must for Celtophiles: This book is a collection of some of the best-preserved
0, Disappointed: The first seven books about Corrie Belle Hollister I absolutely loved!!! I would read a whole book at one sitting.2 of the books I read in one day. But book #8 and this book I had to force myself to finish; especially this book.I have a real problem with Christopher Braxton. He has alot ofemotional baggage. Even though I believe it was a good idea to wait until Corrie and Christopher knew each for 2 years before they got married and I do not believe working for your future father-in law is the answer. He should have been out there looking for a way to support his future wife and family. But the author never really dealt with Christopher's jealousy over the fact that Corrie could command an audience when Christopher did not have that talent. I have not read the next book and I do not plan to
0, Degrading to Women: This book degrades women. The hero of the story spanks
0, I have to believe ...: I have to believe that this is one of Hugh Grant's first movies. The acting is reminiscent of a high school production. Don't get me wrong
0, Disappointed: I am very disappointed in this product for the money! I thought by the info that I was getting a scrabble board on a lazy suzanne type turn table ( like my friend's). Instead
1, It's Wonderful!!: Super Scrabble is way better than regular Scrabble. One can make so many more words and make many more points. 2 of us play every week and our scores are in the 700's. Of course we fill our holders with 9 letters instead of 7 and sometimes we even use 2 holders
0, Very poor quality: Love the idea of this game
0, Jipped! Did not get what I ordered!: Ordering this was a waste of my time
1, great for kids' artwork: i love these for putting the kids' artwork on the fridge. they are small and inconspicuous and can hold 3-5 sheets of paper easily. BUT they are easily knocked off by being close to the fridge. mount the displays high and they will not be brushed off
1, great book on nutrition: This book is prescribed for my nutrition course but its depth of information goes beyond coursework material. It is the kind of book everyone interested in good health through nutrition must have. I was intent on selling this book after the course but now
1, Great Driver: This was my old driver and man did the ball come off this club. I loved the sound it made when I would swing full power
1, Timeless Classic: Originally produced as a gag.....became timeless classic.After 40 years
0, These will never work as perfume bottles: They are extremely flimsy
1, Funny Yet Serious: Bongwater's Kramer's second solo album combines
0, Unwatchable Art House Refuse...: I wanted to watch a murder mystery
1," The first full recording of ""Carmina Burana"" I ever heard: My father came home one day in the early '90s and said to me and my sister"
0, Terrible: This is the most uncomfortable ankle support I have ever worn. The hemmed places all around the heal makes it impossible to walk with it on.. And I have fat feet and they swell at times but the part closest to the toe is very loose making it hard to put a sock on so you can give up any chance of wearing this for a walk.. Going back to the hem around the heel
0, Disgusting!!!: I thought this was trash. Adults and children that have everything and can't even pick up after themselves or their pets.Disgusting!!
0, Who lets an animal starve to death? Bring back the guillotine: This family is human filth.They wantonly let lizards and fish die.Why are they not in jail?You don't just not forget to feed animals.
1, Goes right to the point!: First of all
0, same as 5th ed.: This a pretty good reference for basic EKGs. Easy to read and refer to but the 6th ed has very little change from the 5th ed. I have them both. Basically prettier paper and a slight change in the books layout; otherwise it is word for word as the older 5th ed.
1, Captain Howdy = Gooood...: A truly odd band. Featuring Billy West (the voice of TV's Ren and Stimpy) on guitar
1, Adult adventure seen through the eyes of children.: What a shame that this novel was not appreciated when it was written and apparnatly still is unknown. High adventure with a child's touch.The prose is simple yet poetic and the characters
0," DISAPPOINTING: I am a big Jan and Dean Fan. They WERE great but the newer cuts on this album are really bad. Not meaning to dis Jan but his choice of ""songs""(?) is bad. I admire him for his strength of soul to come back and work but the ""music"" is really not good. I LOVE the original Jan and Dean works."
1, Daevid Allen - 'Who's Afraid?' (Shimmy Disc): I was literally amazed at how good this early '90's solo effort of Daevid Allen
1, So little a book but what a tale: The writing style makes the otherwise easily formulaic story flow like a lovely tapestery as per the norm of the author
0, We can offer better material than this!: Why would we want to teach our children how to use poor english
1, outstanding...as usual: Although the quality of the video/sound is far from optimum
0," This is by far the worst book on holograms in print: I believe this book does a great disservice to our industry bringing the worst ""Internet ethics"" into the realm of technical literature. It exploits the fact that there is a real need for a new book on this subject and cynically fails to deliver the goods"
1, Awesome book. Thrilling
1, My instinct would have Red-Flagged Ted Bundy....: or so I thought! I have sharp intuition as well as some psychic abilities. Therefore
0," Ann Rule Rules!: I have read all the full-length books by Ann Rule and some of the short story collections. ""The Stranger Beside Me"" was one of her first and"
1, Almost too good to be non-fiction!!!: As a crime writer
1, OUTSTANDING!: This is an awesome CD. When I heard it for the first time I knew I had to get it. It's too bad I can't find it anywhere
1," Does what it needs to do.: One of my systems had no standard 1.8"" sound input. What I needed to do was use my headphones"
1, Good product despite deceptive verbiage on box: I got the iMic as a higher-quality alternative to the cheap sound card on my XP laptop. For this purpose
0, CAUTION:: DO NOT READ CALL IT COURAGE: This book is sOOoOoooOoOoOo boring...I practically fell asleep~!!! Try to avoid reading this book. I had to read it for school and you do not want to know the torture I had to go through reading it. This book is way too predictable and Mafatu is so unrealistic. It was plodding and it only got a little bit interesting at the end. And I can't believe Call it Courage got the John Newbery Medal~!!! That is so not right. Well
0, Call It Courage: Call it courage was one of the most boring books in the world. When i read it i could not consentrate on what was happeing. it almost made me fall asleep it was so boring. Some people liked it but not me! its a fast and easy book but its too boring! to me it just kept dragging on and on. If you like adventure you might like this book. I dont like books like this so thats probably why i didnt like it!
1, Great: My son loved it!! It was in perfect condition!! We got it because his sister was reading it and he was interested!
1, Call it courage by Armstrong Sperry: Call it courage was a good book. It was written by Armstrong Sperry. It is about a kid named Mafatu who lived on an island. On the island the people worshiped courage. Mafatu had no courage because when he was little his mother was taken by the sea. Ever since then mafatu had been afraid of the sea. Later in the book Mafatu leaves the island and faces his fears of the sea.
1, riveting and greatly acted: with two performances by Elias Koteas and Giovanni Ribisi this movie is special with its great story about Giovanni who plays Gary Gilmore who is going to be sentenced to death and his brother who doesnt remember him played with grace by Elisa Koteas. It's an HBO movie straight to video after it was on the channel.
1, It works
0, Doesn't work: I wore this necklace several times and now realize that I wasted my money. I can't even tell the necklace even has any titanium ... there is no magnetic field. If you want true titanium (no clothe cover)and that does seem to work ... stay way from the 'cloth' covered ones since you can't verify what is underneath unless to disassemble to necklace. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1, Briefing on Phiten Titanium Necklace: Well... actually it looks really cool.. so cool that my friends are asking me to buy some more of this product for them.Regarding the effect on me
1, Necklace: I bought this as a gift for a niece. She told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends.
0, stupid: this is a piece of crap i ordered my about 2 weeks ago and the only good thing about it was that it came about 2 days early which was good but the necklace broke the second day i got it.
0, A Gimmick: Bought the 22 inch Navy Blue one. Should have bought a longer one as it can still be seen when I wear formal shirts at work.More importantly
0, Disappointing: I purchased this book for $2 at a used bookstore. Initially I enjoyed the quirky characters but they all turned out to be such losers. There were also too many characters and the story did not flow so I stopped reading it about 2/3 of the way through. This book will not enter my collection. It will go into my bag for donations. Maybe someone else will enjoy it.The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.)

1, guy clark review: Great CD. Fast service with a great price. I'll get to see Guy Clark live on October 16th.
1, Unrelenting excitement!!: I picked this book up in an airport after the book I started on the first leg of my trip home failed to hold my attention. Granted
0, waste of time and money: this is supposed to be the author's first time at writing non-fiction. however
1," Hard to put down: These M.I.T. ""Geeks"" refined the skill of card-counting to the tune of a cool $3 million. Using professor Thorpe's proven mathematical theory and a solid team system they assault the mega casinos in Vegas and throughout the U.S. Planning each invasion like a military attack"
0, Meh...: I saw the movie and was intrigued. The movie wasn't great by any means
1, good: i like the book. i had to read this for my AP stat class but just read the sparknotes. i bet the book would have helped me pass the essay :)

1, Judge this Book by It's Cover!: Cocktails
0, This needed to have more umph to it: Rhis book needed to have more umph
1, good non serious read: This book was a fun quick read. Some people in their reviews seemed to take it too serious looking into the specifics of MIT etc. Its an exciting story that is probably going to be a movie
1," Not A ""How To"""
0, Pencil is an odd size and product breaks off: The pencil is an odd diameter
0, Love This Movie
1, great book on cd: I am really enjoying this book on CD. I like that it is unabridged. I want to hear the whole book. It is great!
1, A great Bible study!: Do you want to know the God of the Bible? This is a Bible study that will increase your perception of Who God really is. If you can define God
1, better than ever: I like the new version of the Good Earth Caffeine Free tea better than the old version. To me
0, Tastes great
0, Used to be excellent
0," Ridiculous misrepresentation--I'm so disappointed!: The product description for this tea on Amazon states: ""All Good Earth teas contain absolutely no ... artificial flavors ...."" What a joke. The third ingredient is ""artificial flavor""! This product used to be naturally sweetened with Stevia leaf. It apparently has some kind of artificial sweetener now. What a disappointment. I will be cancelling my ""Subscribe and Save"" subscription for this product! Don't buy this product if you don't want to be drinking some unknown artificial ingredient."
0, Contains Artificial Flavors!: After trying this tea at a friend's house I was smitten
1, Best tea I've ever had: This tea is delicious! I'm addicted. A guy at my office gave me some to try and I was hooked right away. I drink this tea every day.
1, My absolute favorite tea - and it is all natural: Delicious! My favorite tea
1, Take tea and see!: Good Earth Original Tea Blend
0," Good Earth Tea Goes Down the Drain: Good Earth Tea (Original Sweet and Spicy)~ whether caffeinated or decaffeinated has been my favorite tea for many years. I am sick with disappointment over degraded and truly unrecognizable taste of this formerly perfect cup of tea. I will be telling all the friends I have introduced to the ""good old recipe"" over the years that our Good Earth Tea is no longer the same and that they should not waste their money on the newrecipe. I'll be taking the last four boxes I bought back to the grocery store for a refund. I called the TATA company this morning to find out the scoop on the change of the taste of the tea and to register my disappointment. If anyone from the new Good Earth Company reads Amazon reviews"
1, Wonderful herbal tea: My mom loves this stuff!! It has excellent flavor that is spicy but not overwhelmingly so with a mild natural sweetness.
0, Oh
0," If you liked the old ""Original"
1, again not a kid but love black metal: this has to be the best of all the cradl of filth albums i being a huge fan love this album they are my favorite band and enjoy their music not because they are satanist (of course i am a satanist and 15)but because they consist of beautiful lyrics and have an incredible talent i recommend this album to anyone INVERT THE CROSS AND BURN THE CHRIST HAIL SATAN!
1, Perfect!: I just dug up this CD from my older CD box the other day. I forget what an incredible listening pleasure I get from it. It is such a good example of good art: varied elements that complement each other
0, *Yawn* ZZZZzzzzzz: I was only able to get five chapters into this book- honestly the theme was tedious- treaties were broken
0, Great while it lasted: The first one of these I owned lasted a couple of years. A replacement one lasted only a couple of months. Got a Farberware instead. Farberware is less intuitive but has not broken after several months.
1, Arrived in perfect condition!: After reading previous reviews the only thing I was concerned about when ordering these crocks was if they would arrive un-cracked. They did!. Perfectly package in their own box
0, Pointless: Is Adrien Brody an actor? He has the same register in any movie. I expected more form this movie
0, Shallow
0, Is this a way to honor the origional Superman?: I haven't seen this movie
0, Dull: Given the interesting subject matter
1, Ummm.. Great!: This thing is great for working muscles...My girlfriend also uses it. Let's just say it works great and she is very satisfied with it.
1, Action
0, cheap: I bought this as a gift for my mother. We liked it at first until she wore it for a while. It turned her finger green. Very disappointing.
1," The Founder of Kyocera and Japanese DDI Company: More than 'Japan Inc."" ... For Outsiders to understand the Japan. For Japanese to understand themself. For Worldwide people to read and learn about one 'Company Way of Life'. Very good style. Clear points"
0, too much for a disco light: the leds would only display as a group indicating the peak voltage rather than display only the measured volt
0, Don't waste your time!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The TV show is more funnier than the movie. Man
1, Funny!: We watched this with the family
1," ONE OF THE BEST: I disagree with most of the people who say that ""CRIMES OF PASSION"" is better than IN THE HEAT.... I don't think so. The first album by Benatar"
0, Lasted 1 year and 4 days-Buyers beware: We liked the picture quality while it lasted-Broken after 1 year-4 days of moderate use. Hyundai warranty is only for 1 year from purchase date. Bought this online and the warranty started when I paid for it
0, Terrible: This scattered and incoherent film never builds any empathy or interest in the characters that populate it. Cinematography is darkly beautiful. I defy anyone to get all the way to the end of this film in one sitting.
0, A wee tad bit TOO abstract...: Whereas I appreciated the abstract
0, Lynch's Worst: I was a big fan of David Lynch untll this movie came out. It had a good
0, The Movie is Awesome
0, David Lynch
1, MASTERPIECE!: A really mysterius
0," Not ""the worst move ever"""
0, lose this flick: this movie was so pointless and horrible! people try to analyze it into becoming a good movie but when it comes down to it
1, A Darker Freaky Friday...: So David Lynch explores here some of the themes of jealousy
1, Great Film
0, Good concept
0, Uncomfortable: This guard didn't fit right - uncomfortable
1, Great Pump!: This is a great little pump that will work in a variety of table-top fountains. I've used it in fountains that I've built
1, Does what it's designed to do.: Hole punches like this are for punching PAPER. It punched through 4 layers of card stock quite easily. If you're looking for something to punch through leather
0, Cheap Built: Extremely disappointed. I have been shopping with amazon for years. This is absolutely the worst product I have bough. Received it 20 minutes ago. Went through about 30 flash cards and the hole punch gave up.
1, the ventures rock and roll forever: just saw the ventures in new york at the bbking blues cafe still playing great after 50 years keep rockin
0, casts least inspired album: This album is the wost cast album as was later admitted by the lead singer/songwriter John Power. It fails to excite like their debut or prove as moving as their third album. If you like cast for what they do best - interesting pop-rock then you may be disappointed by this flat record. As for the previous reviewer Scott Shea
1, Loved the Movie-Rented it
1, Shower this one with praise!: Even Pig Pen wouldn't mind taking a shower after watching this heart-felt movie about a father
1, Wonderful film!: This is one of my favorite foreign films
1, great psychological thriller: michael douglas and sean penn star in a strange but excellent movie. douglas is invited to play a game simply called the game by his lunatic brother. well douglas decides to play the game and when everything goes awry the viewer trys to figure it out. this was an excellent movie and i would reccomend it to absolutely anybody.
0, Not worth playin: This film is a trite 90's foe-thriller that completely abandons plausibility. The script is terrible
0, Worst movie: This is undeniably a bad movie. However
0, Looks better in the pictures than in person: I would not purchase again. The fan for the price is very cheap quality construction. I have not been happy with the product and gave it away.
1, Great Addition to Your Sixties Collection: Where else can you find Barry McGuire's follow-up hit? Who cares? Well
1, Henry Huggins: Henry Huggins is a boy that lives with his mom and dad in a house on a street called Klickitat Street.Henry is a ordinary boy that nothing excited ever happens to him except when he was 6 years old he broke his arm by falling out of the cherry tree. When Henry goes downtown to swim at the Y.M.C.A he finds a dog thta he wants to keep and then his life changes when he has that dog as his pet. He relizes how pet are important and hard to takt care of.He needs full responsibilities to take care of his dog named Ribsy.
1, Henry's New Life With A Pet: This story takes place in a street called Klickitat Street and it takes place somewhere in the past. It takes place in the past because when they go to the store everything is cheap.This book is mostly about a third grade boy named Henry Huggins and his friends Beezus
1, very good intro to Islam: This book can serve a very good introduction to Islam. I highly recommend this book for people wanting to learn about middle east and islam
0, VERY DISAPPOINTED!: I ordered this book of Soil Mechanics from Terzaghi. I received this book
0, Gave away most of it.: I really wanted to like this tea
1, good taste: This tea has a really great taste even if you brew it for longer than you supposed to. I would recommended it to a tea lover.
0, Did not like: Very bright
1, Most Excellent Tea!: This makes a very satisfying cup or pot of tea. It's smooth without being weak
0, toilet safety rail: The product looked great
1," Review of the Book Titled ""Heroic Leadership"" by Chris Lowney: I enjoyed reading the book titled ""Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year_Old Company that Changed the World"" by Chris Lowney (2003). The author discussed the historically development of the Jesuit Company and the leadership experts who made this possible. The Jesuits developed the four pillars of leadership -- self-awareness"
0, Funny For All the Wrong Reasons: Really? A killer Turby? An apology for American Psycho? This autobiographical farce is impressive only in the number of way it manages to fall off target on so many levels.If you're familiar with his earlier books
0, Are you kidding me?: I've never given a book a negative review
0, Horrific: I could not believe how bad this was. Intriguing premise that turned into nothing more than a bad drug trip. I kept waiting for the payoff at the end
0, An object lesson on what drugs can do to a brain: This book illustrates the effects of long-term drug and alcohol abuse far better than any lecture a parent can give. Mr. Ellis can't anymore distinguish between reality and the replays in his imagination. It's hard to feel compassion or even interest for someone who has lots of money and fame and feels so
1, Any Easton Ellis fan will love: This is one of Easton Ellis' best works. If you are familiar with his writing style & have always enjoyed his books
0, Returned mine: I have no problem with the picture of this television in general
1, Slaying it: The video Defy is considered by me to be the best wakeboard movie of it's kind. It is fast paced but grounded in the stunning cinematography and out of this world style. Danny Harf is one of the top names in the sport and watching this opens people's eyes to the sport of wakeboarding in a wave of progression not seen commonly in wakeboard videos. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
0, Weak: The motor is weak
0, Dont waste your money on this one: Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl
0, wide trimmer
1, What can I say about this? A case is a case...: This case works fine. Sure its a little bulky and I'd rather not use a case. But my mother seems to like hers fine. It has little slots on the inside for cards or cash or something which is handle. I apologize for this comment but it has a more female look to it
0, Worthless For Palm Z 22: Okay I guess for Tungsten and Zire model of Palm devices it's a decent enough looking case
0, disappointed in case: I ordered this 'slim leather case' simultaneously with a new Z22 handheld and the case is too big for the handheld. It slides around in it and the power on/off switch is effectively covered by the 'frame'. Also
1, A little short: This case is beautiful and well made. I just love it. However
0, palm case: I liked the quality of the case but the TX I have does not fit very well in it. You can not use the whole screen. The top of the palm is covered up.
0, don't fit: the ad at amazon suggested that this case should be bought with the palm z-22. however when i received it
0, Does not fit the TX as advertised: I suspect this case was originally sized for other
0, Cheaply made
1, Well worth the money.: I do construction safety for a living
1, Fantastic Story - A Great Read: I first read this story from my local library about ten years ago. I loved the story so much that at least once a year I would re-checkout the book so I could enter the world of Moloquin once again. Then just a month ago
0, WARNING this is not the original product but some cheap knockoff: This is not the same product we bought last year. It was so cheaply made that after we filled it with water and hung it up
0, Cheap imitation knock-off of original product: Buyer beware!! This product is not Flies Be Gone. It is a cheap knock off imitation named Flies Away. Of the 3 traps I purchased
0, Not That Great...: I was drawn to these by their price
1, Should Be on DVD!: Higher and Higher is an enjoyable lightweight comedy/musical from 1944 and stars Michele Morgan as a scullery maid who becase their once wealthy boss is now broke the other servants hatch a plan to pass her off as his wealthy debutante daughter and get her married to a wealthy husband but she is in love with someone else
1," A pleasant introduction to the new Placebo.: Along with ""Taste In Men"" and ""Slave To The Wage"""
0, Complete waste of money: I had two sets of these that I used regularly for 4-5 years or so on long family vacations -- took them camping
0, Don't waste your money!: These batteries DO NOT hold a charge. I use them for my backup point and shoot which might sit for a couple of months before use. I learned (the hard way) long ago to recharge the batteries just before I was going to use them. As I did not want to carry my DSLR into a pizza restaurant
1, Child's writing kept me on my toes ...: Once again Lee Child has produced an extraordinary Jack Reacher tome. I had no idea what to expect. I had read the first few pages some time ago when it was at the back of The Enemy. It took me where I didn't think we were going and that is what I love about Child's prose. Going where you don't expect to go.
1, fast read
1, A page turner: GrGreat story. As usual
1, Great story with one caveat: This is the first book I've ever read by Lee Child. I bought it on a whim because it was advertised along with reviews of David Baldacci
1, Good
1, One shot: This was a great book. It keeps you guessing and on your toes not knowing what reacher will do next. This is a great book to turn into a movie.
1, first time reading Jack Reacher book: I liked the book. I saw the movie first; like most movies based on books
1, Give the latest Jack Reacher thriller a Shot!: Jack Reacher
1, Loved it and loved the movie.: Saw the movie first and was so impressed with it that I read the book
1, Love jack: Am enjoying reading Child's books
1, Not like the movie: A very good book
1, Truly Enjoyed!: I really enjoyed the plot
1, Refreshing... every single time!: This movie is a romantic comedy and it isn't
1, one of my favorite movies: A classic road movie / black comedy featuring the brilliant Ewan Mcgregor and of course Cammy Diaz! McGregor's character gets the sack from his boss and gets dumped by his girlfriend the same day. So with everything lost
1, Good read: Good read if you enjoy history and African hunting adventure stories. I would recommend this book to friends. Check it out . If you like this book read Samuel White Baker.
1, Good hunting history book: This was an interesting book of how hunting was back when people had time to hunt in Africa.The author goes all over Africa
0, sellout: why do these guys think they need a perfect production and a pop sound? Everything about this just sucks.I don't understand how anyone can appreciate the vocals. What about bands like satyricon? the vocalist from abigor and summoning is terrific. CoF were so great back in the Principle Of Evil Made Flesh days. this isn't black metal
0, This trash has to get 1 star?: All it is would be mindless idiots screaming out mindless noise.When will these guys get killed off?
1, Classically great!: This book is a reminder of what great
0, JUNK!!!: This product is JUNK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I received this item as ordered for a christmas gift for my grandmother. I thought it would be simple and easy for her to use. Instead
0, Not a good camera: I bought this camera as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. The camera takes wonderful pictures
1, Love this!: I got this for my parents as a gift to share the news that we were having a baby. She collected snowbabies so this was to perfect addition to her collection. Even if you didn't collect them this is the perfect gift to tell someone you are having a baby.
0, Stiff mechanism and poor ergonomics: This blade just doesn't feel comfortable in the hand
1, Frog Juice: My freinds and I all love to play Frog Juice. You can play it again and again and never get bored. I have 3 Gamewright card games
1, A family favorite!: Gamewright makes excellent games for children and this one is no exception.Players collect ingredients such as frog juice and salamanders to complete spells and earn points. This fun game requires fundamental use of strategy and some simple math
0, Dull...: I stumbled across this after I was enthralled with the brilliant The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
0, Don't bother: Having read many dozens of mystery/suspense novels
1, The Fifth Woman: The characters almost come to life as it is written. Great job by not just letting the reader think that all are just the same only different names. It reads like one would imagine a movie. The plot is laid out very effectively with a guessing game to the end.
0, Kind of disappointed: Reading these two novels was like watching two lousy chess games by a low IQ player cursing all the time with dirty words and tough talks. Very bad scenarios with stupid and unprofessional characters in pretentious and inplaucible plots. Rucka should change his main character's occupation since he was not capable in the protection business at all
0, dull: With all the rave reviews from reviewers I usually trust and having an affinity for most British novels
1, A famous book: This is a well known classic written more than 60 years ago that even our commonplace and leftist noise dominated cultural environment could not silence
1, A Movie Great!: I wonder how some people can rate an exceptional movie mediocre
0, Not for fans of the first two albums: If you were a fan of the first two albums of this band and were expecting more of the same on this album
1, Overall a great Black/White screen PDA: Looks sturdy and works well. I love the expansion slot and the photosuite works well with the pda. Even though its black and white
1, not just a toy: when i first bought this palm i sort of thought it was a toy. but i have become dependent on it. it is slimmer and easier to carry than any other palm so the extra few bucks are worth it. the expansion slot is sort of a scam. i dont think i will use it. the price of add-on disks is absurd and the content is marginal. i have not tried to connect to email or internet.i have put a large spreadsheet on but the screen is really too small to work on it. anyone who can read a book on this screen has better eyes than i do.there is a design flaw. to travel you have to buy an expensive charger. they should have designed it so the docking charger can be used as an AC charger.it is easy to use
0, PalmOne m500: The PalmOne m500 I purchased in Sept 2010
1, Solid Workhorse: Basic PDA that has done what I needed it to do for many
0, Horrible hot sync; dead battery in 1 year.: I think most of those who have given this palm a one star or who wish to give it a negative star have summed it up correctly. The palm does not consistently sync. After 1 year of use
0, Review of Palm: This product is useless because there are no drivers for Windows 7. Why would anyone sell a produt that cqannot be used with the current versions of Windows. I wish I had never purchased it or I wish I could find a driver that will work with 64 bit technology.
0, Sub standaard: Terrible time syncing with Outlook folders. No longer supported by Palm Tech support. What's a fella to do. I have already purchased a Z22 to replace this one. I wish it weighed more so I sould use it as a boat anchor.
0, Software?: Looking for some 'cheap' electronic organizers
0, Call Palm B4 you buy: Dont buy!!!!!! They stopped making this unit in 2006. Call Palm and ask for your self.Phone: 866-935-72567Cant even get a battery if you need a spare.
0, won't work on 64 bit vista: The supplier of this products tells me that this is an old ad above. That it no longer comes with a hotsync cradle and you can't use it with 64 bit Vista. That none of the Palm products will work with 64 Vista if you have to use the connection cord so I had to send mine back although the supplier said he would credit my account thro Amazon

1, More than just a story about a trial...: This film provides a clear and concise overview of the incident and the trial
1, The boy and the dog: The book was about a boy who gets a new dog.The genre of my book is farytail.[ Maribel Garcia]
1, A Must For Every Generation: This is a time honored classic of a boy and the incredable bond he and his dog share. This has it all for anyone who can allow themselves to be swept away into into a life so foreign to most of us today. My daughter is hooked on it as I was as a child. A classic to pass from generation to generation.

1, Great textbook: It certainly helps one understand much better how to work with children and provide techniques. However

0, A sloppy
0, WHY
0, Two thumbs Down!: Gigan was good but the toy on strings Ghidrah and the aliens and guy drawing pokadot monster thing was stupid! And also....Godzilla talks? Give me a break! It sounded like some old guy mumbling.
1," daily use: Tool works well on day to day use of lag screws 6-8""in length. Whether installing or removeing. Only problemis rocker switch fails to engage gun after about 2 monthsof use requireing repair. But every brand that I haveused in the past that was electric with same switch typealso failed.I will purchase the Dewalt impact cordlessfrom now on because it is cordless and there is no differ-ence in this one and the electric version.Ricky EvansModular/Mobile HomeSet-up"

1, Great model: This is a great model. Just add a CompactFlash card for more space and some great programs and you've got a great palm! (not that it isn't without all that stuff!)
0," POOR COMMUNICATION: I WROTE A SCATHING REVIEW BECAUSE I DID NOT RECIEVE MY PRODUCT & RECIEVED NO COMMUNICATION. THIS MORNING I RECIEVED A CALL FROM ""MICHELL"" FROM THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THE PRODUCT. SHE SAID THAT THEY HAD SENT ME 3 E-MAILS. I DID NOT RECIEVE THE E-MAILS & TRIED TO TELL HER SO"
0, no weatherbox here...: I'm afraid i must disagree with those ...[deleted by Amazon.com without poster's permission]... that see much 'gone to earth' or 'secrets of the beehive' influence here. It strikes me as much more bluesy
1, Sylvian's syllables simply swivel me !: Loved Japan
0, Bland: Dull music from one of my favorites. It doesn't contain any memorable songs; they just seep and ooze one into another. I've played this three times and have given up. Very uninspired. Too bad.
1, Not by Scripture Alone: I love this book. I am a Catholic married to a Fundamentalist. This book allowed me to have an informed conversation with my husband on the doctrine of sola scriptura. When I ordered the book I was concerned that it would be difficult to read. However
1, Couldn't Put It Down: A very good writer tackling a little known (in the West) aspect of Japan and Japanese history. Although he did make errors when he discusses the historical background to his main subject (e.g.
1, Progressive Rock Is Here To Stay: I was cruisin' Amazon looking for some YES albums when I came across a recommendation for Spock's Beard. Being a baby boomer fan of YES
1, good presentation: This book came in a timely manner
1, Very Happy!: I just bought this wagon for my daughter's first birthday. She is a very cautious little girl and I wanted to find a walker that would give her more confidence with walking. She had just taken her first steps the night before she got the wagon. As soon as she opened it she took off and has not stopped. The wagon is very well thought out. She is able to pull up on it and walk behind it without a problem. I was worried that she would not be able to keep up with it at first but she surprised all of us. The wagon is very easy to put together and very sturdy. I would highly recommend this walker. It took me a month to make my decision and I am so happy with the radio flyer walker wagon.
1, Wagon: This is a great item for toddlers. Pricey when purchased new. This second hand wagon is in excellent condition - looks brand new! What a find.
1, Granddaughters love!: Well made and perfect size. My 3 year old granddaughter pushes her 1 year old sister in the wagon. It was a birthday present for the 1 year old. She loves to sit in the wagon and pushes it too!
1, Great 1st Wagon: I bought this wagon for my friend's son's 1st birthday. Prior to his party I put it together for him and let my 7 month old daughter try it out and she loved it! She was already able to pull up and easily walked with the help of this wagon. I'm going to order one for her for Christmas. When I gave it to my friend's son he loved it too! This is a great toy little ones!
1, Great for learning to walk: My son loves this wagon. We got it for him because he was pushing dining room chairs around-- this is a much better alternative! This wagon is sturdy and heavy enough that it won't slip out from under him. It was easy to assemble and seems very well made.
1, Great toy: Purchased this with the radio flyer car. Both were a hit for this Christmas season. Our standup grandson was able to hang on and push it and loves to put his new toys in it. Hopefully it will help him keep his toys picked up! as well as provide a fun time.
1, Great toy: My son received this for his first birthday. He loves pushing it around and filling it with his toys. He is walking on his own now and still enjoys playing with it. It is very sturdy and well made. The bumper on the front is great because he is constantly running it into our walls. It's a great toy and I highly recommend it.
0, Missing Moments: In 1969 they used to run commercials on the radio for record albums
1, Whoa: Um
0, Stiffed By Stiffs!: Normally I love all movies with Danny Aiello in them--he's such a talented actor in comedies as well as dramas. This movie with the theme of a divorced dad
1, Cute
0, almost forgetable: I don't remember anything about this movie except that I stayed up late one night to watch it on TV and felt absolutely cheated. I had heard that the movie was good so I thought
0, Five Star Classic -- Two Star HD Transfer: Don't get me wrong. The movie is brilliant and a timeless
1, Mediocre romance
0, Overrated: The hype surrounding Four Weddings when it was first released in the UK made me imagine it must me a great movie. What does everyone see in it? Grant is irritating and a stereotypically English upper-class boy
1, A great reference after you've taken the course: This was the required book for my college's power electronics course. Like a lot of college books
1, Surprisingly Impressive!: Who would have thought that these accounts of Wagners's Overtures by Gyorgy Lehel leading the Budapest Symphony could possibly be competitive with the many fine versions already available? Not me
1, WOW !!!!!: I was very apprehensive of buying a reconditioned vacuum. I figured it would arrive all scratched up and nasty. Well
1, DYSON: THE BEST: This vacuum cleaner sucks...REALLY WELL!!!! I cannot believe what came out of my carpets! I vacuumed with my old vac first
1, Bought it Reconditioned: Disclaimer ***the only connection I have with Dyson is that I bought their vacuum***I bought the Dyson reconditioned from Amazon last week and I am really happy with it. The suction is amazing - I have old apartment carpeting that was practically flat and it brought up the nap quite a bit. The only complaints (minor) that I have are that it heats up a room very quickly (it's 100 degrees here in CA); and the attachment wand is awkward to use.Other than that
1, Outstanding: So far so good.......Buying reconditioned is a little risky
0, A bootleg: Why is this album on amazon.com? It's a bootleg of Joni James recordings unauthorized by her; she owns her own masters and all this music is legitimately is available and easily obtainable.
0, Don't order from Abundatrade!!: Although the movie was great
0, PSP Only Digital Download... Really?!?: Only one comment: You can tell that Columbia Pictures is owned by Sony. Though it says in big
0," Mislead by ""digital copy"" language: The movie is cute"
0, Movie is great... beware of digital copy promise: The movie is GREAT. My complaint and reason for the one star is that it eems Sony got a bit sneaky with this one. They list a digital copy as part of the set. I paid more for this set expecting to get the digital copy. There is one problem... the digital copy only works with a Sony Playstation 3. It does say this on the back jacket of the disc set. However
1, Great Movie: This is a great movies. One of the funniest I have ever seen. It will take you back to your childhood.
0, The Cycle Path Review: This book while interesting
0, Does not work: I purchased this item because it seemed to have decent reviews and it was supposedly the one with the best noise reduction. Honestly
0, Didn't work for me!: These ear plugs didn't work for me
0, I was sadly mistaken: The good reviews outnumbered the bad so I went ahead and purchased. Sadly
1, Works great for the price: This does the job. If I wanted something any better
1, superb without a doubt: if you really and truly understand this film and get in depth and touch with it
0, Was does reality have to do with it?: This movie makes a mockery of the crimes it based itsscreen play upon. Gee
1, Excellent look at our justice system: This movie totally opened my eyes and formed my opinion on capital punishment in our society. I feel if anyone believes in the death penalty they should see this movie before they commit themselves to it. Sarandon and Penn were both excellent
1, I LOVE a movie with a happy ending!!!!!: *******SPOILER ALERT****No
1, Must read for managers looking for ways to improve performance!: For those managers who are looking for a clear
1, Vito Bass or Alto Clarinet Reed Guard Model 2439: This reed guard does the job perfectly. An elastic strap holds the reed to the guard
1, nice looking: My husbands Christmas gift. He has a hard time seeing numbers
1, It is a simple and nice watch.: Seiko Men's SGG711 Quartz Titanium Case and Bracelet WatchMy friend like it very much.He said the watch was simple but looks very nice. It is match with his style.
0, Great watch
0, listed in wrong catagory: This is a mechanical watch. It was listed under atomic watches. Be careful. Read everything. You want to make sure you get what is desired.
0, a surprising and aggravating bore: With all the hooplah about this film
0, This movie sucks: Whenever my family and I see a bad movie
1, unusual: Fargo manages to take very dark subject matter
0, Very Disappointed: This was the worst movie I've ever seen!!! Every other word in this film was a cuss word. The murders were extremely brutal and graphic. There wasn't much of a plot and it was extremely boring. It depicts all the people from Minnesota as weird. The worst part was
1, frozen and quirky: Doesn't everyone need a Marge in their lives? No crap
0, TOO STRANGE FOR ME.: VERY WEIRD MOVIE
0," An utterly pointless movie. 'nuff said?: No? OK. How about this:Who cares if the ""accents"" were done well? You can win an Oscar for doing a great accent? So much for the meaning of an Oscar. How does an accent make up for a half hour long plot diversion that leads NOWHERE?This movie is one of those that DEFINES pointless"
0, What a waste of time...: I love DVDs and watching movies. This is one I wish I had never seen
1, The truth is stranger than fiction..: When I first heard of this movie
0, 1) Dangerous 2) Do not work that well: If you take your car seat to the CHP for inspection/installation
0, Really bad...: It doesn't stick
1, One of the greatest bands ever.: This album by At The Drive-In ties Cursives storms of early summer as the best CD I've ever bought.I've listened to at the drive-in since thier release of Acrobatic Tenement released in '95 by Flipside.I fell in love with this album Only to wait another 3 years to get In/Casino/out. This album gave me the chills. I was used to hearing at the ATDI on old bad recordings and staticy records and when this came out it rocked my world. They have every style of music incorperated in there songs. Well worth the 10 bucks.If you have the chance Pick up the Vaya EP that rocks too.
1, Take a Leap of Faith 
0, Defective: One of the wires wasn't soldered to the battery. Unfortunately
0, Don't waste your money: Despite the title
1, A five-star compilation of stories to rank among Bass' best.: Rick Bass is a phenomenal nature writer
1, Stormlover: I was very impressed with the great lengths the author took to document and verify all the tornados in this book.If you find storms
0, BAd BAd BAd: Do not buy
0," No review: I could not watch this DVD on my DVD player. I received a message that said..""Not viewable in your area. Please eject the disk"" I don't know what that means. I have never had a problem with a DVD from Amazon before."
1, Quite a Tale: Five suspects who have done some crime toward a man all criminals fear: makes quite an interesting story. And the twist will make you think :D
1, One of the few truly 5-star movies I've seen: Before I saw this movie
0, The Usual Suspects.: The Usual Suspects movie is a bit obvious from the beginning who Keyser Soze is!(Kevin the communist chavez castro lover spacey)along with Benicio del Toro(Useful tool and che lover) the movie could have been better
1, Six Stars if I could.: One of the bset films ever made
1," A Must See movie: We follow the narrator Roger ""Verbal"" Kint who tells the tale of how criminal mastermind"
0," Puhleeeze.: This silly tripe beat ""Braveheart"" for the 'best original screenplay' oscar? Give me a politically correct break."
0, Not much of a surprise.: Who's Keyser Soze? Isn't it obvious? Not a very interesting movie. The characters are unlikeable. And the screenwriter obviously felt that inserting the maximum number of profanities would prove his 'hipness'. Repulsive flick!
0, Horrible Digitization of a Great Motion Picture: The fact of the matter is that Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie's USUAL SUSPECTS is one of the best films to come out of the studio system in the last ten years. However
0, very sad: you can tell that the show in dubling was great
0, An insult to Irish dance and tradition: This... was... terrible. The camera angles were awful
1, bad
0, Disgusting: These are horrible. Horrible.Usually I can eat the snacks that my child rejects and if I can't stand them
1, Awesome: I heven't listened to my headpins albums for a couple of years
0, What a thoroughly awful book!: If there was a rating lower than one star
1, great fruit strip for kids: Love these for my two year old. They aren't sticky like most fruit strips. They keep him happy in the car and are fairly good for him. We have them stashed everywhere!
1, Intelligent book: I am not a student of philosophy and this is my first book to read by the author. Naturally
0, I didn't get it: Who killed the BUTLER? and more important why did I buy this book? I could have made my life all the way through without never spending a minute reading this. But for Nietzsche Buffs I guess it is a must have!
0, Archaic language destroys a masterpiece.: T.S.Z. is easily one of Nietzsche's best books
0, Avoid this Clunker: As the other 2 reviews mention
1, A most for travelers!: If you think about traveling but you don't know where to go
0, Travelling without seeing: It must be a terrible burden to travel while being weighed down by the burden of plenty
1, I want to go back after watching this: This tape has everything you need to know about the Grand Canyon.It's beautiful and educational.After watching this
1, 5 Stars for the White Company
0, permanent: I ended up not using this product after realizing it would be permently affixed to my tub. I didnt feel like rueining my bath tub just for a little more grip.
0, Did not stay adhered for more than a week: Unfortunately they did not remain adhered to out bath for more than a week before most of them came off. We followed the directions for installation as specified. I would not recommend this product.
0, Don't stay stuck to bathtub floor: Not only do these easily come up off of the bottom of the bath tub (even though I applied them precisely according to the package directions)
0, these are worthless: These are the worst decals ever. I bought these in place of those rubber mats for the tub that get all gross and full of bacterial and mold. I followed the directions about how it said to wash the tub then wipe with alcohol to remove reside and soap build up. I stuck them to the floor of my tub once it was dry and reside free. Well 3 days later they started peeling off. Not all at once but a few each shower till they all came off. I was very disappointed. But for the price I wasn't going to complain (too much).
0, These suck: I really wish I had not wasted my money on these things. We bought them to put in the tub for our baby who has just transitioned out of an infant tub. I cleaned the tub well
0, very dissatisfied: I followed the instructions thoughly and gave them double the time to dry out than what was recommended. But
0, Poor Bathtub Safety Stickers: After properly cleaning my bathtub and allowing to dry
0, What a waste of perfectly good trees.: I've read a lot of science fiction books over the years
0, product showed up water damaged: I would not buy from them again
1, Wonderful Book: I have read other reviews on amazon about this book and am slightly disappointed. Those who are true sci-fi fans do there best to see the big picture but let bits and pices of rational thought slip so they can take in the fantasay of it all. Some who have reviewed this book have not looked at things with an open mind all the way. This text is wonderfully written and in time will be one of the sci-fi treasures of the 20th century. Aldrin has lent his insight of alien worlds come through
1, Excellent almost real sci-fi: Sure
0," God-Awful Movie: Read the novel by Richard Matheson if you want a good ghost story. This movie is far too Hollywood and does nothing right except two scenes. It also blasphemies by including footage from Night of the Living Dead! I barely made it through w/o turning off the movie and returning it right then and there. This is one of those movies that feels like it's trying really hard to give you the finger. And ""Paint It black"" by The Rolling Stones"
1, A great film: Another one of the movies of 1999
0, Only ok
1," Good music from the Boss: I enjoyed this Video anthology of ""the Boss"". It had a lot of my favorite songs and a few new ones I had not heard before. (They actually were not new songs"
0, Terrible: The worst audio book ever. They repeat the 10 mins or so of affirmations 2-3 times on each side of the casette wasting any time they might have had to teach you something and the affirmations are not even that good.
0," undersized-: Hardly fit a 27 lb. dog very tightly- wonder what it would have looked like on a ""large"" as it said dog- I think it may have fit on one leg of my German Shepherd."
1, Nice looking and useful stew pot: I just received my tomato pot. The color is not as bright red as the picture shown on the web site. I'm slightly disappointed for the color. Like the other customer's review
1, Amazing!: Alfred Hitchcock is one of the best directors ever.These make timeless pieces. I remember watching them with my dad when I was a young boy
0, What a stinker!: One of my favorite actresses playing a totally dislikable character character. No help from other characters. What a waste of a good cast.
0, Boring and Silly: Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a boring
1, AWESOME CLASSIC AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN SAY: ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER RECORDED ...FILLED WITH MEMORIES (AND I WAS ONLY 2 AT THE TIME)..A REALLY REALLY 60'S TRIP BACK IN TIME TO THE DAYS OF EXTREME MELODY
0, Nice looking
1, Horns
1, The Decemberists meet Uncle Tupelo somewhere in Montana: Tarkio is the old college band of Decemberists' frontman Colin Meloy
1, Fabulous Diapers: For the first six months of our son's life
1, We love these diapers!: I picked up a pack of these diapers at Whole Foods on a whim. I love that they are environment friendly
1, 7th Gen. great diapers!: I have been converting my house into a safe and toxin free environment for my little guy
1, Great diapers
0, Bummer: I was really dissapointed to find that I had to wash my daughter's bedding nearly every morning due to leaking through. Also
1, Best Diapers around: Seventh Generation Diapers are truly the best disposable diaper. My daughter has been in them since size 2. They are super absorbent but without the chlorine. She never gets a diaper rash with these diapers. I also REALLY appreciate the plain style. There are no logos
1, only one problem: I think these diapers are very good and pro-health
1, The best 'natural' alternative to regular diapers: I must admit that I think I liked these a little better before they 'reformulated' them
0, Tabs are too big to be comfortable: I picked these diapers because they were chlorine free and I like most of Seventh Generation's other products. Overall
1, browns are mo better: these diapers are made without the use of chlorine
1, Cruelty-free and wonderful!: I have used these diapers on my daughter since the day we brought her home from the hospital-she is now 9 months old. As a staunch consumer of cruelty-free products
0," Good idea... ""leaky"" execution: While the idea of a less ""fake stuff"" and more ""environmental friendly"" diaper is appealing"
1, Still the best
0, Long Day's Journey Into Boredom: Convinced by my computer teacher to read this play
0, Im not happy with this product: The book delivered was not the same as the one advertised. The cover was different and was not in good condition. I ended up going to my school library to buy another one to replace. False picture of the textbook
0," 1 great quote and that's all there is: Mary says: ""None of us can help the things life has done to us. They're done before you realize it"
1, brilliant album!: i just got this album today and already listened it for 3 times haha! amazing album
0, Bad 80s Music: I bought this used at a record shop because it was in the Heavy Metal bin & I liked the cover
0, need a degree to understand: I didn't understand a word in this book
0, NO ES MUY BUENO.: EEL MATARIAL ES MUY INCOMODO PARA UNA BEBE
1, Interesting and informative: I saw Big Sky years ago on PBS and thought it was excellent. Depicting trappers doing business with the Native Americans. (i think Blackfeet) I just thought it was a good movie cause I like Kirk Douglas and Arthur Honeycutt. And the female in the movie
1," ""Confused!"": Editorial reviewer Sam Sutherland has titled this film The Imposter? Whats up with that? Anyway one of the greatest films of all time"
0, ANOTHER WATHCES A DUMB MOVIE: Ok if you think this movie was a good horror movie then i dont want to know what you do in your spare time because this movie was dumb.I didn't even jump in the movie.The special effects if you even call them special effects were pathetic.I dont care if it was made in 1976 it still was stupid.Star Wars and Jaws were made at the same time and had good special effects.If you have about 2 hours to waste then watch this movie if you dont then dont watch this.
0," Disappointing ....: ""Jack of all trades"
0," wow! no wonder it's calphalon!!: (Purchased in may 2003) I just have to say how excited I was when I bought this skillet because it was ""calphalon"" wooooo!!! Oh well after 2 months of using rubber spatulas"
1, Incredible Little Pan: This pan is the perfect small frying pan. It's thick bottom heats evenly and the nonstick surface in very durable. I saute everything in it
1, Amazing Crepes: Well I finally got one of these when it appeared in my gold box for 4 washingtons less than a jackson
1, Useful griddle/pan to have in the Kitchen!: Pro's- Non-stick
1, For the price
1, Best pan I own: This pan is amazing. It takes a bit longer to heat up but NOTHING sticks to the surface. I use it every day....wipe it out or wash it and use it again. Worth every penny you spend on it.
1, this pan is great: this pan made a Calphalon fan of me. Never sticks
1, Great for Crepes
0, Worst product from the Brand: I thought this gonna last long. After 6 months of normal use it lost the nonstick coating. I always use wooden or nylon spoons. Very bad quality from Calphalon.DON'T BUY.
1, I love this versatile non-stick pan. I have TWO of them!: I have used this pan for cooking just about everything. The non-stick coating works great. Do not use an abrasive cleaner such as Comet to clean the non-stick surface. I made the mistake of scrubbing too hard with a kitchen sponge that had comet on it. That seemed to take away the super slick surface. I now use that pan when I don't require a non-stick surface. If this pan is used correctly
0, Hard to Handle: OK
1, Works well good pan for the price: We have used this pan for over a month now and no problems to report. Solidly built and non-stick surface seems durable and works well. No complaints at this point.
0, Nonstick? Really?: I've followed the directions on use and care of this thing and since I got it in 2006
0, junk: this pan is junk made in china. it appeared to be a second rather than a first quality item. i immediately sent it back.
1, Great gun except the price: this is a good gun and needed for any airsoft war but it is slightly over priced i bought a clone for under $300 on airsplat which is slightly better because it comes upgraded and it comes with the 2400 round electric box mag
1, Calming
1, Very good chant (esp for the price): I could not conceive (initially) why so many seemingly good chant tracks were being sold at such a discount. After purchasing and listening to it several times
0," Nothing ""simple"" about it: Preparing cow brains and eels might be simple for some"
1, Reads Like a Novel: Even if you have no desire to prepare French food
0, low budget redneck action flick: This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a low budgetaction flick about bootleg alcohol in the deep south. It has a decent storyline and ok acting but does not provide any real thrills. This kind of filmgives Rednecks a bad name.
0, Bargain--but
0, You can do much better than this CD: The only reason I gave this CD one star is because you cannot rate a CD with zero stars. I would not recommend this CD at all. First
0," Not for Internet/e-mail use: Don't buy this if you plan to use it to send e-mail and view web clipping apps ""on the go"
0," Disappointing: I have used Palm for several years having beenn disappointed by the demise of the Apple Newton. My palm V and then my palm 111C worked for me flawlessly. I have now ""upgraded"" to the Palm m505 and have just sent in my third return. Not one of my new palm m505 has synchronized properly. One of them didn't even go on right out of the box. My brother also bought a m505 also and he has just sent for a replacement"
1, I am not sure what I did before I owned it!: About the only thing I don't like about the m505 is the the dim backlight. It's fast
0, A rare failure from Palm: I am a huge Palm fan and use my VX religiously. But . . . this product is a disaster. The so-called color screen is so dull and lifeless that I couldn't tell that most screens were in color at all. I ordered the game and travel cards. The game card did not work at all. The travel card contained next to no useful information. Just an awful product.
0, Disappointed: I did not research this one because I was happy with my previous palms. The screen in the ads has the night light lite so it appears to have backlighting which is does not. You have to have direct light to see the screen.You can use the light to make up for the darkness but it runs the battery down quick.To add to my sting. The m515 came out 3 weeks after I bought it.I will probably get a Clie or a Handspring the next time....
0, dissapointed: Review of Palm 505
1, Palm m505: got the product promptly. works great
0, The color could be better . . .: The screen gives me a headache--literally. The color is okay with the backlight on but it drains on the battery. Other than that
0, Shocking...: Leonowens will never realize how she has condemned an entire nation with her lies. True
1, The King and I: What a classic! Drama
1, Good if were all on one disc but...: I LOVE THIS MOVIE. And the special features were interesting
1," A classic: Some of the most beautiful music and sets ever created for the screen. The theatrical production of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is one of the most amazing scenes I remember seeing as a child."
1, Wonderful!: Every Little Step is a superlative documentary that took me back to all those years I spent in dance studios in New York
0, Daybreak into Darkness: An extremely poorly written book
1, Shy people like it too!: Real Live Nude Girl was recommended to me several times before I picked it up. Knowing something about Carol Queen
0, NOTHING CLOSE TO MAYNARD!: IF YOU LIKE GOOD TRUMPET PLAYERS AND ARE IMPRESSED BY ONES THAT CAN GO HIGH
1, An uncomplicated book for its time: The book does a good job of keeping the storyline simple and uncomplicated .. not too many characters. However
0, very slow: This is my first Austen novel
0, I have to rate this book even though I have not read it. Its for my Grand daughters English class
1, Gatsby: The Great Gatsby is simply a classic
1, A Great American Novel: When asked what the 'Great American Novel' is
1, Good classic: I decided to finally re-read The Great Gatsby since I only read the cliff notes edition back in high school :) Great story
1," One of the best: I've read so much literature in my life and ""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the best pieces of American literature I have ever read; it's touching"
1, My granddaughter's book: All I can review this book on is the shipping of the book. It arrived earlier than expected and the book was in good enough condition. My granddaughter had to have it for school so I ordered it for her.
0, Very boring book: It's one of the worst book I ever had to read. Mind numbing things that this guy does. I just don't understand why it's suppose to be one of the classic. I wouldn't have read it if I had the choice.
0, Sad!! horrible and boring: i cant believe people buy this book
0, but why is it loved so...: There is no need to establish that this novel is considered to be one of the finest pieces of American literature of the twentieth century
1, The Great Gatsby- An American Masterpiece: I can't stand to have one of the best novels of the 20th century be bashed and misunderstood. One cannot simply read The Great Gatsby- it has to be experienced! The themes
0," Too ""performed"" - avoid.: I am hooked on audio books. I have a long commute to and from work everyday and I can't wait to get in the car so I can get back to my audio book of the week. I was so excited at the prospect of listening to Tim Robbins narrating The Great Gatsby"
1, There's a reason they call it Great: Stop being retroactively pissed at your high school freshman English teacher and just admit it: The Great Gatsby is a damn fine novel. This is the third time I've read it (first and third for fun
0, Uninspired: It grieves me deeply that we Americans should take as our classic a book that is no more than a lengthy description of the doings of fops.You would do better reading the Iliad.
0, I just don't get the big deal: For years I have seen this book on every list of great
0, so boring i wanted to kill myself: back in high school
0, A TITLE FOR YOUR REVIEW: I HAVE JUST STARTED READING THIS BOOK AND I DON'T LIKE WHAT I READ SO FAR.IT IS VERY COMPLICATED TO UNDERSTAND AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CHARACTERS.I AM STILL READING THE BOOK SO MAYBE IT WILL GET BETTER.
1, Some say it's over-rated
0, Not aware size is TINY: The book is a little pocket edition
0, I didn't like it!: This book was just so bland. So vanilla. this book had nothing of any importance to me what so ever. I had no emotional ties to the characters and the whole thing just made me yawn!
0, OK
1, classic: I reread this in preparation for the movie coming out this year. I am so glad that i did as i had forgotten just what a classic this book is. A great story with robust characters that will transport you to another time.
0, the only good thing about it was its simplicity: Even though I only had to read this for school
1, Beautiful language and a great storyline: A great read! If you love the roaring 20's or just a good flowing novel read this.It is one of those books that you just can't put down. F. Scott Fitgerald makes you want to finish the book in one night
1, A treat....: Fitzgerald is an oasis in today's literary desert. Wonderfully descriptive language flows over and around the reader. Looking forward to seeing how the new movie version translates the mood of the book.
0," Singularly centered: The whole story appears to revolve around this huge ""love triangle"" of Gatsby trying to get Daisy to come back to him and leave Tom. Upon close scrutiny of Gatsby's actions it would appear that they all are leading up to how he could meet Daisy again. The main theme of the story."
1, Gatsby: I love this book so much
1, The great gatsby is about love 
0, Great?: I read this for book club. I can't believe it's a classic...I thought the characters boring
1, Olden days: This title did bring out the society of the 1920's and was very well written. Prohibition caused social problems and classes in the society and F. Scott Fitzgerald certrainly showed he had an understanding of this society. I'm sure when this was written
1, Fourth time read!: This is the fourth time I have the honor of reading this book
1, The Great Gatsby: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a must read book. I give it 4 stars because of the dramatic scenes and situations that Fitzgerald depicts. The book is an epic love story between Jay Gatsby and the lovely Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby who lives in a large mansion would throw tremendous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the insational love of the married Daisy Buchanan. During this story Gatsby follows his dream of getting Daisy back at any cost......even death of other people or himself as well. Fitzgerald's strong values and beliefs were clearly presented which is a very entertaining style to read. One thing I would criticise about this book is that the action of the story does not start until the fourth chapter
1, One of the Best pieces of american literature: The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book. It is story of a rich man
0, not so good: it has no purpose.....its a hard to readboring book!?!?!? i dont find it that interesting...but i have to read it for school so what can you do?
1, Genius and Confusion: F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless classic of the Gilded Age
1, Works great for my digital camera: I spent a few hours researching rechargable batteries and found that this brand seemed to be the best. The batteries are 2100mAh NiMH. They charge in an hour or two
0, Where is the power?: I regret that I purchased these batteries and the charger. All I can say is that the batteries don't hold a charge. A wasted $40.00
0, not good quality: my AAA battery last about 4 to 5 hour(i use 700mmh)but worst thing is sometimes
0, dissapointed: would he plz stop the singing. please. I liked nightynine alot because there was very little singing. The album was very intelligent. The production was top notch and I thought it showed alot of growth from their previous releases. Solutions was also good
1, pretty damn good: id have to say this is the one haujobb cd that i like generally all the songs off of. solutions for a small planets had some really good songs but some really awful ones as well. i like the balance of mysterious strings and minor notes that really put you in another curious world. however my one complaint about this is there could be a little more originality in variations between the different tracks. though the album is well rounded
1, Band on the Come ??: Fusion
1, Dobby's review: This is a great movie. It is very historicaly accurate. It tells everything about the journey in around 2 hours. It is filmed very well. The setting makes it interesting and scary. The music is placed and gives you a hint of what to come. I do not recommend this movie to young children. There are some wars and lots of blood. The wars and the way the indians faught
0, I am Gerard Depardieu: I am not very pleased with my
1," Funky: When I got this CD I was pleasantly surprised and inspired. The ""Call On Me"" Euro Dance Mix is my favorite. Very funky."
0, Not in the same league as Sheridan's first three features: 'In The Name of the Father' played a dangerous game in changing some of the facts of the Guildford Four case for 'artistic' reasons
1, Brilliant film
1," The tragedy of losing a child: ""On Beulah Height"" has been well reviewed already. I can add only that it is very strong writing by the ever reliable Reginald Hill on a gut-wrenching and dark subject. This is the author in a very serious mode meditating on the chilling experience of threats to one's children. Very little room for Hill's famous humor and wit here. A wonderful story though that adds to this author's stock as on of the best mystery writers at work in the English language. Recommended."
1, Welsh is the bard of the new century Scots working class consciousness in distress: All I can say is that the main characters of 'Trainspotting': Rents
1, Different -- but wonderful!: I was a bit nervous about seeing Trainspotting -- it's not the type of film I usually enjoy. However
0," Yikes!: I was horrified to read this book and would not recommend it to anyone. To give a sardine ""humanlike"" qualities and a personality and then describe the way ""Arlene"" goes through the canning process is morbid and borders on the macabre. What next? A children's book on ""Elmer"" and the enbalming process? Arlene Sardine is not a book for either children or children at heart! Too bad there is not a ""no star"" rating because this is what this book should receive!"
1, Great reference: I work with food ingredients every day and this book is a standard
1, One in a million: This book is what I am looking for all this while. I have tried seaching high and low in most of the bookstores in my hometown
0, These Weeds need to be Pulled!: I'm a fan of Weeds and Mary Louise Parker .... but this show has run it's course! Not good!
0, Ditch Weed: Goddawful
1, Good Farnham: If you liked Whispering Jack
0," Not too good...: I love Freedy Johnston. But I am woefully disappointed by this CD. I loved ""This Perfect World"
1, Works perfectly: Could not be more pleased to find this genuine Delta aerator. Our 35 year old Delta kitchen faucet finally works like new again!
1," A classic.: The film was so much more enjoyable than ""Brokeback Mountain"". I really"
1, Makes you want to live in a natural setting.: This is one of the best movies about growing up in a challenging natural world.
1, A Rare Modern Gem: This is a gem of a movie. Ulee (Fonda) is a lonely and bitter bee keeper raising his two young granddaughters. Casey (Biel) is rebelling and Penny (Zima) is pulling inside of herself. As a favor for his jailed son
0, good movie but dont by from this seller: this video played ok but the sound has some thing wrong with it i had the volume twice as high as normal and snd still could hardly hear it
1, No better herbal laxative than this on the market: I have been taking this product for years for regularity issues. This works with no cramping. I take 1/2tsp at night before bed with a little warm water. It works better on an empty stomach. You must adjust to your own needs. I take it three or four times a week. Senna and some of the other herbs can have a somewhat bitter taste so
1, If you have not read Rebecca you may appreciate this book: more. Even though I like some of the others who reviewed this book prefered Rebecca. I do not however think these are two books that should be compaired. Yes
0, Witty politics at its worst
0," TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING.: LG IS A WONDERFUL AUTHOR AND I HAVE ENJOYED MANY OF HER BOOKS. I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THIS ONE SINCE IT WAS SO HIGHLY RATED AND WAS NOTED TO BE THE ""BEST"" OF THE BRIDE SERIES. WELL INTO THE BOOK I WAS STILL WAITING FOR IT TO GET GOOD. THE FIRST 300+ PAGES ARE JUST SO MUCH BLAH"
1, Impeccable book and service.: This has got to be one of the most pristine copies of a used book I've ever bought on Amazon
0, Full Screen Theatrical Edition: This version is terrible on a wide screen TV. It is formatted such that all the subtitles cannot be seen
1, A celebration of Plains Indian life: I have to tip my hat to Costner
1, Beautiful: Beautiful scenery
1, Dances with wolves: Definitely worth the money. The material added really adds to an excellent story. The dvd was as advertised. This damn review of 20 different words.
1, My favorite movie: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I love it much I have watched it more than a dozen times over the years.
1, Dances with Wolves: Realy like this movie
1, Dances with Wolves: This DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was a gift for my son-in-law. They watched the video in their elaborate home theater and enjoyed it very much. The music in this movie is absolutely awesome!
1, 4 HOURS FLIES BY !?!?!?!?: Of all the positive things I could say about this gorgeous
1, Kevin Costner at his finest: Great story and great film making! Even the special features where well worth watching! I will probably watch this film every month until I wears it out!
1, Finally: At last we have the complete movie and all the bonus material (Special features) in Blu-ray format. That's what I've been waiting for a long time. I won't review the movie
1, Mother Daughter Book Club @ Edmeston Central School (NY): The purpose of this club is to read books with strong female characters and Saffy's Angel immediately caught our attention. It looked interesting and filled with suspense and adventure. Our favorite character overall in this book was Indigo. Sarah's father was extremely funny and interesting. The way that Sarah hid Saffy and allowed her to come with her (without her parent's permission) was kind and a good deed from a close friend. Bill was a rude
0, Doesn't look like St Francis: This movie is okay but the old movie
0, Wrong Actor for the Role: Mickey Rourke as St. Francis Of Assisi? I don't think so. This is one of the strangest pairings of actor and role
0, Intermatic should be ashamed!: Same as others. I bought and replaced 3 units. All failed within 6 months. STAY AWAY.
0, 3 months then dead: like so many others i loved this product at first. then
0," Works for 2 months of light use then breaks: This product looks great but be prepared to see ""inop"" on the display after a few months"
0, A Good Replacement Alternative: If you're like me
0, I wish I had read the reviews first: Third SS7 is now reading NO OP.....But Thanks to Archie hitting it with a hammer turned the lites on........Ordered the Swylite on EBAY anyway.............Intermatic should include hitting it with a hammer in the instructions.............. Am going to try the hammer routine on my car first thing in the morning..then my cellphone..........Thanks Archie
0," Non Op failure after 6 months: Great product - while it worked. The battery died at about 6 months and I got a Non Op warning at the same time. I think Intermatic knows these things are going to fail regularly. The trouble-shooting section of the instruction manual states ""non op"" message either means the unit is cold or needs to be replaced."
0, Crap: This product is crap. First one was replaced by hardware store within two weeks of installation. Now its NoOp after 4 months. Dont waster your time on this product....very unreliable.
0, See 'Pawns in the Game' for the Truth: Yes. Download and read 'Pawns in the Game' by William Guy Carr
1, Free Mind: George Orwell (Eric Blair) shows how someone can be an idealist but
1, A great first hand account of war.: This book is THEE Spanish Civil War book
1, A pleasure to own: Pictures and text to satisfy the most discriminating. Inspirational to this nature photographer especially interested in the overlooked/underappreciated aspects of the world around us so worthy of our attention.
0, The Power of the Machine: This is a compilation of academic papers not intended for the lay reader.The numerous embedded citations are distracting. It is written in sociological jargon rather than English. With hundreds of heavily referenced ideas
0, Hollywood
1, Best movie ever !!: This is the kind of film that Hollywood needs to put out more often. This is also Tim Robbins Best. Robert Altman hits the Bull on the Behind with this Winner. Solid great Cameos. Very well casted. The Pros&Cons of the Biz.
0," Forget it unless you're an Altman fan: I rented this movie on the advice of a friend that it was ""a great movie"". I'm still not sure what she saw in the film"
0, Never showed up: Can't review something that was never sent. Still bitter about it. Would like to be able to review--was hoping to use it in a class. Used something else instead.

1, Fantastic Story: This story is about the adventure of Barney and his pals during whom they tried to put the strange egg back to where it landed. Barney and his pals used imagination
0, Barneys absolute worst movie yet!: Barney's Great Adventure was a horrible example of what this loveable purple dino is capeable of. Ive never seen such a boring and unpurpousful presentation! It reminded me of a jar of moldy Grey Poupon!
0, Horrible
1, pretty cute: You'll either love Barney or be so annoyed by him that you want to scream. There's not much room in-between there. Obviously
1, Great!: it in the wrapper and shipped fast! My son really loved the movie and I try to buy him new ones. The price was very helpful thanks alot!
0, CDs don't work on XP: My son had these programs for our OLD computer (Windowns 95) and loved them but his disks wouldn't load on the newer computer (XP) so we ordered new disks--I told him these probably won't work either--and they do not work on XP. Does anyone still have a Windows 95 machine in in operation? These are GREAT games
1, Maiden en la cima del mundo.: Este doble disco en vivo
1," Best Live album of all time!: I first bought Iron Maiden's ""Live After Death"" album back when it came out in 1985 and to this day"
1, One of the best Live! albums ever.: Live After Death (along with ALIVE! from KISS) are the two best live metal albums ever. This is a non-stop assault on your senses. Every song is better than the last. You miss this album... you miss the best of the beast.
1, MASTERPIECE: As live albums go there are few better than this
0, Don't buy if you own an Intel Mac: After I purchased and opened this product
0, Does NOT Work on Intel Macs!: The iShock II WILL NOT work on Intel Macs
1, exciting and full of thrill.: If you like action and wet season
0," Would Have Been Good...: This movie was ""alright"". The action was top-notch and building an entire city set and then submerging it under water is impressive"
0, Some good action but otherwise: The movie could of been alot better
1, what a movie: if you ever watched FLOOD the British movie it is close to about the same thing with different story's in there own way. great movie. 5 out of 5.
0, A new James Bond knock-off: Very disappointing after some of the fine work Ludlum has done. It reads like a poor James Bond with the hero able to always succeed at every impossible task and unbelievable bad guys who always screw up. The Bond girl kills the pilot and machine gunner in a helocopter with two rifle shots while driving a speedboat at top speed on Chesapeake Bay
0, Convoluted and Implausable: I received this book as a Christmas gift and was surprised to see it as I remembered that the author had died a year or so ago.Whether this was a completed and unpublished transcript or a partially completed transcript that was finished by an unnamed ghost is irrelevant. I found the story line very implausable
1, Entertaining Throughout!: I enjoyed this book. It was hard to put it down. The person that put this story together had or has a fantastic imagination. There were two surprises I did not see coming. The clues were there but I was blind sided. You have to admire the person that could think this story through and put it on paper.Robert Ludlum has to be a master of the English language. I don't think I have ever read a book that had so many words I have never seen before. Some examples: gestalt
0, Brain-Dead Beach Reading: If Ludlum is your thing
1, The Janson Directive: I have read many books by this auther in years passed. When I bought my Kindle Fire
1, One of the great comedies: I loved this movie from the first time I saw it
1," Classic Coen brothers: Not their very best work- try ""Fargo"" for that- but if you like the Coen brothers' films"
1, UDT - Ultimate dude trip: Great movie. Full of cranky jokes
1, Excellent!: I _really_ enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it. It has extremely likeable characters and a very perculiar plotline (Which I usually enjoy.) The only reason I had to give it 4/5 stars was because I simply didn't enjoy myself all that much on second wieving. But it is still a brilliant movie.
0, MAJOR disappointment: I just didn't get it. Not funny at all
0, Not my brand of humor: I suspect that there is a sub-culture that would find it hilarious
1, Mark it ZERO
1, Bridges outstanding
1, Hilarious!: I'm not going to go into details about this movie. What I will say is that it is bizarre and funny as hell. Really
0, bogus: I SPECIFICALLY PURCHASED AN HD DVD PLAYER SO THAT I COULD ENJOY SOME OF MY FAVORITE FLICKS ON MY KILLER NEW BIG SCREEN TV
0," Blu-ray of Big Lebowski did not work on my Samsung Blu-ray player!: This was a Xmas gift and I was very upset when my son was unable to play this blu-ray on our Samsung player- which is maybe a year old. The Amazon product information does not state this. The back of the box does state ""that it may not play on some players"""

0, Great Film
1, good music: this is good music. there is not one song that i dont like. my favorite has got to be Hallowed Be Thy Name. Run to the Hills and Children of the Damned come close. i command you to get this album. if you dont like this album then you dont like real HEAVY METAL! HAIL THE IRON MAIDEN!
0, not what I expected.: At first I thought that this was a death metal album but boy was I wrong! This is one of the worst albums yet!Because it's British metal! so don't be a fool like me by getting this!
0, Hines Ward Replica jersey: First off I'll say it was my fault for not reading the details carefully enough. I had just ordered a Premier style jersey with the stitched letters and numbers and loved it. This Hines Ward replica jersey was the screen printed version with the mesh type fabric to let in air. Not a 'bad' jersey but not at all what I was looking for. I had no issues returning the item and getting a refund.

0, Its pretty
0, DONT BUY THIS ITEM!: What a waste! 1. The instructions were so bad
0, Did not work!: Don't waste your money. Used them on my trip to Europe and they were completely ineffective. What a joke! A true rip off.
0," Boring: I have read and loved almost all of the alphaget mysteries (with the exception of ""P is for Peril""). This one was excruciatingly boring. I agree with the reviewers who've complained about too much mention of fast food. The book should have been named ""Q is for Quarter Pounder."""
0, A very boring book.: This is a very boring book. Nothing happened druing the first half of the book and even it started moving the story was flat. The plot was so sketchy that a lot of pages were filled with talks of visiting fast food and main character's love of fast food. This is terrible.
1, Poirot The Classic Collection 4 DVD: Another set in this outstanding series by Acorn Media. Having read most of Agatha Christie's mystery novels

1, My AeroBed is great.: I needed an extra bed that wouldn't take up much space so when friends stay over they don't have to sleep on the floor. My bed blows up and deflates easy enough and my friends say it is comfortable to sleep on.
1, Good for kids' breakfast...: My five-year-old twins don't eat much and are very picky on food. They've been drinking PediaSure for their breakfast since they were even younger; it's the only thing they drink
1, Good Quality: Item was quality and arrived in perfect condition. No problem with shipping. Optical adapter works perfect on my E17 FiiO. Better than going straight in. Happy with my order.
1, he's my man: ah
1, One of the best: Yes Iron Maiden made use of keyboards on this album but do not let that detur you. This is one of the best Maiden albums of all time. All the songs from start to finish are great
0, This album is retarded!: That pretty much sums it up. Dorky lyrics and bland music really killed this one. I bought this one the day it came out
1, Maiden's second best after PIECE OF MIND!: Thsi is almost as good as PIECE OF MIND
1, One of their best and a can't miss for any Maiden fan.: This is a truly great album the 1st two songs I heard were The Clairvoyant and The Evil that men do and just that alone possessed me to get the album ASAP!!! This is truly a Maiden album to be reckoned with and a can't miss for any one!!!
1," Iron Maiden ""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son"": Without a doubt one of Iron Maiden's best albums. It is very heavy hitting and has some great songs on it. This album will keep you pumped the whole way through. From Moonchild through Only the Good Die Young this is the album to buy. Some of the real good songs on the album are ""Can I PLay With Madness"""
1," One of the BEST Rathbone\Holmes Videos!: This movie features Basil Rathbone as Holmes. He is protecting a weapon that the Nazi's want. This is based on ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men."" The Dancing Men are a code to where the weapon is. Moriarity tries to kill Holmes for the weapon by s l o w l y drawing out Holmes's blood. Now this is unbelivible-Holmes-after having 1\4 of his blood drawn out-still can jump up and fight! I won't tell what happens to Moriarity-but you have to watch VERY closly to see. Enjoy!"
0," The Leader's Brain: The book is way to ""scientific"" in it's reading and less direct in how a ""Leader"" would think"
1, More details...: This is a very beautiful set
0, Slow Reading: This book was written in a different time. There is way too much discussion and not enough content. I found the characters unsympathetic and that includes the heroine.
1, Twisty turns: A very good book! The mystery kept you guessing all the way through. I am not very knowledgable about college heirarchy and had some trouble following who was who and what they did. Overall though I really enjoyed this book.
1, It was good.: The book was good and clever. Very good writing. The humor was very tongue-in-cheek.The book description on Kindle said the publish date was July 31
0, A period piece
0, Ugh.: A frustrating and appallingly silly book. Gaudy Night is an interminably related love story framed by an underdone mystery- perfect if you like that sort of thing. Its one redeeming value is that it gives the kind of lift to a highball you just won't get with a coaster.
1, Gaudy Night is a great book!: Wordy

0," More than You Want to Know: I couldn't get through this book. Too much detail about characters I couldn't get to care about. The ""Crazies"" are not funny"

1, Last Splash makes a splash in alternative music upstream!: In 1993
1, Exactly What I Needed!: Fantastic product. I had a lovely pair of french doors that hadn't been painted/stained in many years and were in dire need of some refreshing. This did the trick exactly. I followed the directions to the letter

0, The Sex Life of Joan: Please save your money. This book was not written well
0, Mastered at the wrong speed: The songs are mastered way faster than the original records were. The girls sound like they had a dose of helium before recording.
1, Starry eyed: I loved this book. He explains how to find it so simply that I found many constellations for the first time. His images and explanations are straightforward and he tells the lore behind the names like a comic book. His voice is a live in the stories
1, not dated: It was tightly written. It makes you feel you were there. His journalistic background lends itself to a synthetic rendering of the events.
1, from a die-hard Pern/Mcaffrey fan: I was a bit skeptical about reading a 'continued' author of one of my favorite authors but was pleasantly surprised. The Dragonsblood story fit like a well loved shoe into the rest of the Pern history and lore. I hope Mr. McCaffrey continues on this path
1, I recommend it - get Amazon to send it!: I was delighted to find this book. Rather than quoting Nash's verse at length
0, Cat's flaw: This book is seriously flawed in several ways. It aims to be cute
1, A book to treasure...!: God Created is perfect for Baby's first book as well as on through the grade-school years. It is a thoughtfully-written introduction to the wonders of God as witnessed through all of creation. As a former school-teacher and babysitter...I can see the value of this book as a teaching tool that exceeds this objective too. The superb animations are colorful and detailed. Many hours can be spent teaching baby to identify people...young and old

1," I learned so much from this one book!: This book talks about the importance of communication skills. It is full of helpful ideas that will help you and your business. We often don't realize that we spend the majority of our day communicating -- many of us need to improve this skill. This book teaches the importance of simple language while also guiding our words into the next century with the importance of recognizing ""politically correct"" terminology. This book will help you to communicate more effectively in today's marketplace. It is a fabulous and informative book!"

1, Now's the Time to Buy: A few friends bought the 600 when it first came out--nightmare quality problems. But it looks like Palm's worked the bugs out
0, Problem Phone: The treo 600 has been nothing but problems for me. First after I bought the phone it took verizon a while to figure out how to turn it on...the store said they couldn't do it. Then the phone stopped working and would reset itself when I tried to use anything at all. After getting a new phone I got a 1000 dollar bill from verizon because they had signed me up for the wrong plan and the internet would stay on for 24 hours straight. After a few months the new phone is no longer working...it is now constantly reseting itself. I'm very frustated. Great idea combining phone and pda but get a different model and don't use verizon. By the way the camera is crap...0.3 megapixel...doesnt take any good pics that you can actually see.

0, This might as well have been a toy phone: I got this phone and put the money into it so that I could add some handy software and have an all-in-one piece.

1, Captain America: The First Avenger: The movie awesome. I can't wait until the second installment of Captain America. Also putting Captain America in with the other Avengers (Ironman
1, Captain America: This was an awesome movie! When I first saw the movie I knew that I wanted to buy it
0, Boring film
0, Dull as dishwater: The only thing I liked about this film were the end credits. What a dull mess of a film
0, meh: Just not very good. Cool intro and premise but epic fail after about 15 minutes. Good actor selection
0, Review of 3D vs. 2D: We need about 1
0, Well. Let's see here.: I've seen all the spidey movies. The old batman and Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. Also seen Great super hero anime movies like Hulk vs. and the batman anime movies along with the punisher war zone
0, Crappy Movie: I was so disappointed with this movie because I really like all the stars in it. The movie was so drawn out and boring; if they had cut out all the BS it would have been under 60 mins. I wish they had more action in this movie
0, Notgood: Very simply a boring movie. Some explosions but no real special effects worth noting. Boring plot
1, I'm glad I watched it.: I was never very interested in Captain America
0, really dissapointing: I saw this movie in theaters in 3D
0, OMG
1, Captain America: This is a great movie. I saw it in the theater in 2D and recently bought it in 3D from Amazon. It is great in 3D! If you like the Marvel Comic theater presentations
1, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SECOND: I rarely have seen an action movie I have enjoyed lately; I heard the new Mission Impossible is rather good. The historic blending of fact
1, Mar-Vel-lous: I gave this rendering of Captain America such a high rating because this movie expresses so eloquently what a true american is and why he is that way.I think the actors in the movie were tailor made for the roles that they portray in this film
1, I recommend it: Kids loved it . . . when they're happy - I'm happy!8 more words?!!!! What more can I say?!!!
0, Didn't play: I received this item
0, Rushed: All though the movie I felt rushed
0, This is kid's stuff!!: The action is for kids 10 and under!!!It got pretty boring half-way. It's just a waste of my money that could have spend in some more entertaining way. But if you are a kid
0, VERY BAD ALBUM: IT HASNT NOTHING TO BE LISTENED
1, Not Iron Maiden...Not Gold Maiden...But Platinum Maiden!: This debut album marked the spawning of a band that wouldbecome one of heavy metal's greatest bands
1," Fantastic Family Movie!: This movie was my ""surprise"" for the year. I rented this movie for my children (6 and 8) to watch but I found myself as captivated by this movie as they were. This is an excellent movie that can be understood by children and also appreciated by adults. Adults looking for a great movie that's entertaining for themselves as well as their children ought to give the one a try and dog lovers definitely shouldn't miss this one!"
0, Horrible shipping time: As a student chemical engineer I found the book somewhat helpful
0, For Better or Worse...: I have had Dr. Thomson as an instructor and have used his book for three separate classes. I find the book difficult to follow at times. The end of chapter problems are confusing and seldom can be completed by following the material covered in the text. The book
1, great book: The book arrived quickly and was well wraped. I was totally impressed by its condition. In my view it was in excellent shape and condition. Thank you for the fine book.
1, I love this CD!!: Hey
0, Spice World: I thought this move was not that great. I think that they give a not so good influence to kids. Look at what they wear. It's horrible. I don't think any kid should want to grow up to be like that.
0, Not a good plot: This movie sucked
1, Listen
1, Best movie ever: I've loved this movie for years and after seeing the Spice Girls perform at the Olympics I had to purchase the DVD. Funny
0, This CD is horrible!!!: The Spice Girls need to find some talent. I don't know were but somewhere where talent is being passed out. Not only their music ( which makes no sense) but their movie was terrible. I felt robbed of my money. Take my advice DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!
1, Still Love IT: I had this album on cassette tape when I was little. My older brother threw it away because I listened to it all day. So I bought it again like 15 years later lol. I still love it!
1, Spice!: I think this movie is great! it first came out when i was 2
0," This CD really stinks! PU!: This was one of the worst CD's I've ever heard. ""spice"" is a little better but this one is aful! Don't buy it! P.S. The Spice Girls themselves stink too."
0, insult to music: Well we can't really exist without commercialism but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Nothing wrong with liking it either but at least be aware that its all propaganda
1, good memories: was good
1, Spice Girls - Spicier than the first time!: I don't own this CD
0, OK: This album is okay
0, Spicy
0, Please make it go away please: bad story bad acting basically it left me with that feeling of: What on earth was that it has no real story it is a miss match of wierd events that make no sense that leads up to a concert which last about 2 minutes and is the only thing this film has going for it. If you are a MASSIVE fan I can see you liking it but then again you would like it if the spice girls read out a recipe for cake you just love them. But for people who do not like them so much this movie will not convert and new fans
0," Two stars for ""Viva Forever"": The Spice girls can definetly dance and sing. But their songs are just so dull. ""Spice up your life"" is decent"
0, A movie fans will love... but only the fans.: Been a fan of the Spice Girls for quite some time now. Love their music
0, Spice Down our life: This CD is bothering me.There songs are annoying.When they first came out they were cool
0, Who in GOD's NAME are THESE idiots trying to fool?????: I really can't understand how ANYONE could like the Spice Girls!!! Their music is so lame and irritating- I get quesy whenever I hear it. Some people say- U spice girl haters have no taste in music? NO THAT'S WRONG! Spice Girl FANS have no taste in music!!!! Anyone who likes the Spice Girls needs SERIOUS and I'm talkin SERIOUS mental help!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am the #1 Spice Girl Hater!!!!!!!!!! But anyway
0, How to make a bad song!!: First put some flour with water
0, Easy Riffs: This series of books contains easy riffs - but don't spend much time or money locating them.
1, I hope this is not the last of Elroy Bode's works!: A fine writer whose work I have reviewed before (Commonplace Mysteries
0, It is functional...: Well
0, Save your money: I bought this to replace my old Mouli grater which finally bit the dust. Big mistake. It is sturdy and reasonably well designed
1, Water Filtration Vacuum Clearner: What a life saver product. I received my vacuum clearner just as a miserable flea infestation hit my home and pets. I used a flea powder on the carpets
0, Terrible Vacuum: Bought this vacuum 9 months ago and use it usually once a week. The vacuum is terrible difficult to clean and if you have pet hair the beater bar is completely useless it didn't work after the third time. suction got worse the longer i had it and now its broke in under a year and warranty is only 90 days!!! the part that attaches the hose to the cannister has two little plastic tabs and they broke as i was vacumming the tile i didnt pull hard or anything just broke! you cant avoiding taking the hose on and off as you have to clean the darn thing everytime you use it and that is the only way in and out of the tank. dont buy this unit it is terrible!!!
1, Air cleaning machine!: I love it. Air cleaning machine. Not for everybody. Perfect for a small cramped house with a pet and plenty of rugs and carpet. You certainly need a garden hose with power spray to clean a water tank outside. Yes
1, The BEST: Es el mejor concierto que he escuchado hasta el momento. La interpretación de Fear of the Dark
0, So disappointed...: I usually like Dodd's books
0, Painfully contrived and lacking in depth: Marele Day seems extremely apt at definitions. I have heard the word 'wit' said about her books
0," A bit boring here and there: This book on the life and crimes of Harry Lavender seems to lack the intesity that books need in today`s society. Set in Sydney the book is written on the basis that the reader has been there. Marele Day seems to have put to much complication into it for th average reader. It is a book which seems to relate in someway to the film ""the big Sleep"" in that the reader has to figure alot of stuff out by himself. All in all the author has gone into a bit too much detail."
1, the ultimate Oi! album!: Cock Sparrer were the best Oi! band ever. Straight from the heart
1, Useful
1, Great Classic Novel: Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy
1, Oliver Twist: Classic! It was a pleasure re-reading this book!I am again a Dickens fan. The history he describesas he tells this tale is amazing! I was too young atthe first reading to understand this. With this readingI am more aware of the historic descriptions Dickenspasses on to the reader.This will be relevant in the future.
0, Literary quality does not exist: While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature
0, Not what I expected: I ordered this as a wedding gift for my cousin. When it came in
0, Terrible buy for the price: It was tiny (ie wouldnt properly fit a regular sized champagne bottle)
0, MAIDEN MUST BE JOKING !: Call it lust for money
0, Horrible production: This album wouldn't be so bad if it didn't SOUND so bad -- the mix is horrible! Why Steve Harris took over the mixing responsibilites from Martin Birch (the master!) is beyond me. If they could get Birch to re-mix this
0, Horrible!: Got a pack of 50 of these to burn playlists for X-Mas gifts thinking Sony would be better than the Staples or Memorex brands
0, May work for some: They don't work at all in my Lenovo W500 Laptop with Windows XP and Media PLayer 11 - I have wasted 10 or more until I worked out that ....... they work just fine in my wife's Dell 1501 with Windows 7 and Media PLayer 12.I can't explain why; some reviews speculate it is the CD drive.
0, Do NOT buy Sony CD-R blank audio disks!: I bought a pack of 10 Sony CD-R 80 minute disks. Only 3 out of 10 worked. Buyer beware.
0, Frisbees or Coasters: I looked for reviews of these
0, epic fail: More than 60% of these discs fail when attempting to write them. I'll never buy Sony CD rom discs again. This is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading.
0, HADLEY YOU ARE MISSING ONE THING
0, HORRIBLE COVERS-HADLEY SINGS LIKE A CHANTEUSE IN A NIGHTCLUB: Cover
1, Great Adventure!!!!!!!: This movie is absolutely great. My parents recently bought it on DVD and we all watched it. It's a great movie which would deserve a higher rating. Many people said that it is boring. I think they have said that because in the first 20 minutes of the movie no one is talking plus Mowgli isn't talking. Well guess WHAT
0, couldn't get to finish it: I was able to get down to the last 10 minutes of the video and in went out on me
0, Predictable and dull: This book had me scratching my head
0, Don't bother with this one !: Alright
1, When he's good
0, Boring!: This has got to be the most boring movie I've seen in the past couple of years. The people writing good reviews for this movie must be friends of people who made it or have some financial interest in promoting it because it is BORING!Do not waste your money on this yawner.
1, Happy Camper: I received my copy of Life in a very timely manner
1, whasup homeboys and homegirls: thiz movie was funny! the cast was whoa it was good. if anyone did not like the movie they must not have a sense of humor. whooooooooooooooooowe thiz movie was funny i happen to be a friend of martin lawerence and he let me in to a privet screening! peace and buttermilk!
0, Not for everyone: Fans of R.A. Lafferty will likely appreciate this one
0," Started out somewhat OK; then the Singularity happened.: Started out somewhat OK. Sometimes the ""humor"" reached Neal Stephenson lows"
0," Where is the plot?: This book has received great acclaims for the many ideas and concepts presented in it — if you trust the raves on the cover. As I see it there are mainly two ideas: 1) convert all available matter to ""computronium"" and 2) upload yourself"
0, Horrible Book: This book reminds me of the people who throw around fancy words without any real depth to their knowledge. If you want a book packed with techno babble but no interesting plot
1, Great
0, A Hint Of Better Things To Come: This is Teenage Fanclub's first album
1, ol western: Thank u for this DVD my Grandma truly enjoyed it. However I didn't understand the movie at all but was greatful to spend time with her!
0," This isn't a good movie.: I saw this movie in class. It isn't good. The most retarded part is when they keep talking about that stupid chair! And then when they have that ""eerie"" music they zoom in on it. P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C! The only good part is Grace Kelly!"
1, The Greatest: High Noon
1," ""The Western that started it all"": Fred Zinnemann(the Director) started a new type of western film when he made ""High Noon."" ""Unforgiven"""
1, high noon: ONE OF GARY COOPERS GREAT MOVIES
1, As Good As I Remember It From The First Time: I saw this one many years ago on television. Unlike some of the other old movies I have been sold
1, Very Satisfied: I was very pleased with my order from this seller. I received it promptly and in better condition then was described. I will buy again from this seller.
1, Eternal Classic: This is the ultimate American Western. Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood ain't got nothin on High Noon. White Hat guy vs. Black Hat guy
0, Dull with potential: This story could be great if the W- brothers condensed it into one or maybe two movies. Two and Three may be condensed maybe not one. The first movie was fresh and innovative. Two and three dragged on and on. The whole concept and the theories were very interesting. I had to force myself to stay awake during the last two movies. The movie moved too slow at the beginning and too much special effects in the second part. What this movie missed was balance and a decent pace. Too bad because the concepts were really interesting and worthy to explore. I had to step out for a couple minutes during the fighting scene for personal reasons and did not to miss anythig...and that says something about how overdone something is. Wait until this comes out in DVD and then skip the long drawn out battle scenes unless this is what you like most about the movie.
0, Final Verdict: My mouth was agape
1, The best (and worst) of what we love about this epic story.: I was lucky enough to preview this movie the night before it was released for the masses
1, Not good enough for the budget it had...: While I loved the entire series
1, Why can't people like it?: What's the problem folks? Why is this one so hard for people to swallow? It was an incredible film. And who keeps saying there wasn't enough action? Were they in the bathroom the whole time the machines were attacking Zion? Series not resolved? Of course it was. Neither The Matrix or the machines were destroyed
1, So worth it: Did this movie live up to the original Matrix? No. But then agian
1, WOW!: Ok
0, why>?: Why did they release these sequels? They are dumb and just does not add up to the spectacular first MATRIX... I refuse to even watch the other two movies because it will take the fun out of the first movie... i dont even care if the sequels have the best fighting scenes or the best graphics since 3-D... it is not that crucial to see these movies at all...If you want to see these sequels and love the first one... brace yourself for the worst series since the FRIDAY THE 13th series....
0, Why do you persist? We ask the same thing!!!: I really loved the Matrix. Smart
0, disappointing: The fan boys would have you believe that this movie was good... and if you think it wasn't then you are stupid and just didn't understand it.I understood it. It was a serious disappointment. The first movie was so good compared to the second and third movies.Rent it - once is enough...
0, Disappointing!: I saw this on opening day. It was a complete waste of time. The 'Animatrix'
1," Enter the Matrix: Revolutions Preview: At the end of the ""Enter the Matrix"" video game"
0, And some say second was bad?: The worst movie of all trilogy. The second was bad and I thought this one can`t get any worse
0, sigh...: The first was incredible; the second (Reloaded) wasn't too bad for a sequel; the third was boring.Trying not to be biased
0, i never felt so ripped off: what a terrible movie
0, This Film Never Should Have Been Made.: Neo hangs out
0, HOW DARE YOU WACHOWSKI BROTHERS! WHAT IS THIS!?: WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING!?! THE MATRIX WAS PRETTY GOOD! AND THEN THE MATRIX RELOADED WAS BETTER THAN THAT! AND THEN CAME THIS WORTHLESS LITTLE SPECK! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY TRILOGY! THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT WASN'T AS LONG AS THE OTHERS! IT'S FLASHY
0, matrix revolting crap: I will make it short and sweet
0, Revolutions? Revolting!: Oh my...I walked out of the movie theater very disappointed after seeing The Matrix Reloaded. However
0, Matrix Revolution
0," Too bad...: I do not recommend at all to buy this movie. Go buy Matrix 1. That was a great movie. This one isn't. I think we need to e-mail staff for matrix 2 & 3 and tell them to ask LOTR's staff on ""How To Make a GOOD Trilogy and NOT to DIE trying"". Its a pity they didnt know how to continue such a great story."
1, The Matrix FoReVeR: I'm a big real big fan of the Matrix. I'm 12 year's old and i'm a female. I think this movie is better than all the matrix 1 & 2. The first movie had a sense if I was really in a computer world control by machines. The second was a little better than the first. It had an other sense of Neo being in control of the matrix until Mr. Smith showed up.The third movie is more intense with lots action. It had all tight graphics. I really like the special efects that made this movie possible. It's to bad that this last part gave away A best ending to the trilogy of the Matrix. I hope no one ever but I mean ever comes up with a movie as good as the MATRIX TrILLoGy. MATRIX FoReVeR
0, Matrix Revolutions: A major let down
1, Great cd but: All of the tracks on this cd are great but
1, Good but not the best: This new 10 Foot Pole album is with no doubt a good melodic punk album
1, Evidence Presented Here Needs More Attention: Between the scientific evidence and the common theme of ancient legends presented
1, Modern Western wonder: Where has this author been?This book was so masterfully written. The story is incredibly woven and layered. Don't think this is an old West story
0, missing instructions: This product is a wonderful piece of equipment to puree
1, good design
0, Poorly made: I bought this food mill to make apple sauce and it did a terrible job. It took forever and the spring kept falling off. After only 3 quarts of apple sauce it broke completely and is not useable. The good thing is the company who sold it is taking it back. I would definitely not buy this food mill.
0, Not very good: I have never read the book
1, not bad viven leigh: i watched this verison of anna karenin right after i watched the greta garbo verison. i like that it extends the story in the movie
0, BEWARE! THIS IS NOT THE GARBO VERSION: As the illustration clearly shows
0, Great movie
0, Problems with the actual recording...: I liked the music from Minority Report
0, One of the worst Maiden albums: What the heck happened to Maiden on this album? OK
1, No Apologies...: I know alot of Iron Maiden fans despise this record
0, NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING: TAILGUNNER-6/10HOLY SMOKE-6/10NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING-7/10PUBLIC ENEMA NUMBER ONE-5/10FATES WARNING-6/10RUN SILENT RUN DEEP-5/10HOOKS IN YOU-5/10BRING YOUR DAUGHTER... TO THE SLAUGHTER-6/10MOTHER RUSSIA-6/10
1, THE PUNKFEST IS ON AGAIN: Imagine the first Iron Maiden album only with Dickinsons vocals in it...get the picture?
1, Unfairly disregarded album!: Why this album is considered to be bad?Well
1, Ground Control to Major Tom: My how time flies. Duncan Jones
1, Lonely
0, Hallucinations Not Entertaining: For much of the movie the main character is hallucinating
1," Amazed!!: Such a well made movie with a low budget. Not your typical ""Michael bay"" explosions sci-fi type of movie. I heard good things about it and decided to buy it. Well worth owning."
0, far side: A bleak film whose idea gets away from it. By the end you're pretty well tired of throwing up
0," No gravity: ""Moon"" is light instead of dark"
1," Slightly Predictable but Worth It: This was a great movie! It's a SciFi movie with an outstanding ""emotional twist"".Sam Rockwell carries the entire movie by himself and is worth watching from beginning to end.The movie moves quickly through the story and never leaves you bored."
0, Couldn't get interested in this one to save my life: Revolted robots
0, Don't Waste Your Time: Dear God
0, Please stop the remakes: $70 million to whack out the head of the FBI? The Russian gangsters in this clinker obviously don't shop around for hired killers. As if hearing Gere's Irish accent isn't bad enough
0, Good build-up
0, What the .... ??: Here's another Hollywood remake of what was a great story (and a great movie as well). So far
1, Good no-frills DVD: This DVD has good video quality. Audio is adequate but Dolby 5.1 would have been great. Lack of subtitles is puzzling but not a deal-breaker.
1, More people need to know this man's music!: I had heard about Ray Lamontagne from watching American Idol...which I'm sure is a strange place to hear about an indie artist. However
1, What was I waiting for??: I resisted the urge to buy this cd when it first came out because of the overplayed song Trouble. I liked the song
1, Every album Ray makes is WONDERFUL!: Trouble is Ray Lamontagne's first album and when I heard the first track from it
1, The perfect drug for a pain junkie!: There are few songs let alone albums
1, Love this album!: Listen to this CD over and over again. Really love Forever My Friend and Hannah. Discovered the album after hearing Trouble on the radio a few times. This is a great find!
0, Cliche characters and nanotech as window dressing only: The psycho son Greg was so boring killing everyone. I had to skim over half the book. I couldn't even finish this slop. What a waste of time? So unoriginal!!
1," Lots of Back stabing and the ""New Morality"" madness here.: Nano Machines and intrigue are all in this book. The Dream of a manand his Son to build a future that people seeking freedomcan build on. The Moon"
1," Freakin Awesome Band: This band is about the gratest band in the history of our ""fair"" state. They will rock you silly nomatter what your taste in music. The Lyrics are brilliant and witty"
1, Great book!!!: We have been able to access information on the Israel-Palestine conflict from the media. However
0, Review of Unabridged Audio: I am sure the book is wonderful
1, great story line: Book five of the series is just another masterpiece. This book keeped me wanting to read and continue to read
1, Nineteen yards total!: An enjoyable double header with comedy
1, Nice gun: This is a nice nail gun for the price. I have used Senco all of my life and like them better than this one
1, Rock solid so far: The nailer has performed flawlessly so far. No complaints. It has been a good purchase. Milwaukee makes a good nail gun.
1, One of John Ford's Best!: I am watching this movie now on TCM and wished I had the ability to record it. I haven't seen this in years and am reminded how wonderful and entertaining it is. The casting is so perfect
0," dissapointing: I'm sorry to say the book did not live up to its AD. It is clearly for people that have already built boats in the past. It constantly used terms not defined. The part on ""Lofting made simple"" left me (a decent wood worker) scratching my head. If you know all about building small boats buy this book. Then again if you already know then you don't need it."
0, Not as good as you might hope: While I have enjoyed previous TMBG cds this one is just not working for eithe me or my son. He screams if I put it on
1, One of the best giants albums ever.......: NO is one of the best albums ever made by They Might Be Giants
1, The costs of war: This CD
0, Hattie steals the Dinner Party!!: throughout her career I have found Hepburn to always rattle on too fast and breathy... signs of a nervous performance but that is the last characteristic of this well founded famous talent
1, The Allyn & Dacon Guide to Writing: the book came in fantastic condition!!! just as the reviews had said. i am really pleased with the outcome
1, Quite informative: I chose this book as a reference for an essay I had write for my college course of Western Theatre. It gave much information that I found quite informative.
1, Jake grafton teaches marines what it's like on a carrier: Jake Grafton has to teach marines what it's like to be on an aircraft carrier. Landing and taking off on a slipery deck
1, Another new favorite author: I am usually on the lookout for books that are hard to put down
1, Always like these books.: Jake Grafton Novels are always a good read. We like these books. Stephen Coonts is one of our favorite authors.
1, A Secret: Dubstar are one of the biggest kept secrets in the music business. Goodbye is Dubstars best album and it contains the hit singles
0, Broke Three In Quick Succession: I bought three of these when I saw them in a local store
0, oh
0, MORE HORNS THAN GUITAR: I found a copy of this after reading the review
1, Great Value: It is a great shirt and if I could get him to take it off for a minute I could say more
0," Not for ""nonspecialists"": The cover states the book is for ""students and nonspecialist"""
1, When Boxing&Fundamentals Mattered: this is the Kind of Boxing Match that many Fighters now&ahead should watch.this shows the Complex&Chess like Vibe involved in Boxing.Ali used Rope a Dope to Defeat Foreman something that many a Fighter wouldn't dare do.because with the Power of Forman's Punches chances are they would have been knocked thru the Ropes.Ali made a Major Statement with this Fight that Forever Crowned Him into His Legacy.You gotta See it what a time Period&Fight.
0, Not so super sticky!: I was hoping that I could stick these on my moving boxes to organize our belongings but alas
0, I don't get it and was hard to swallow: This was sooo boring and the worst book I have ever read. I really had a hard time getting through this book. It dragged
1, Fascinating: An excellent excellent novel. I highly recommend reading this... I couldn't put it down.
1, Beyond me: A quirky and somewhat heart wrenching account of the second world war and how one man copes with his experiences there. A little hard for me to put a finger on what it all means
1, My new favorite: The novel Slaughter House Five is a great story. It describes Billy Pilgrim's time travel and adventures throughout the whole book. The writer kept me going and I could not put this book down. It is definitely a reread and I look forward to reading more of Kurt Vonnegut's writing pieces. Though
1, Anti-War Farce Through Science Fiction: Kurt Vonnuget is one of the most unique writers to emerge in the 2nd half of the 20th century. All of his novels contain a blend of sarcasm
1, A great book that shows the effect of war: I read this book in a little over a week. It was an easy read
1, A very nice edition of a favorite book of mine: This is a beautifully printed and bound edition of Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece
1, EXCELLENT
0, Awful: I don't know what I was thinking when I started this book. I had heard it was strange
1, SLAUGHTER HOUSE FIVE: THIS BOOK IS BY FAR THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER BOTHERED TO LOOK AT THIS WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THE WORKS OF KURT VONNAGOT AND I ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT. THIS BOOK RULES AND I RECOMEND ALL HIS OTHER BOOKS AS WELL.
1, Random is not always a bad thing.: Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is an anti-war novel mixed with outlandish ideas and lots of satire. His thoughts skip around at times
1, What can I say?: The title of this review seems to run with the content. After I read Vonnegut's most famous novel
1, great: everything went well with transaction and delivery. The book was for a project and it was a great way to purchase.
1, History Wrapped In Fiction: I originally read Slaughterhouse-Five back in high school
0, Very
1, Hours of fun for little boys.: Very nice
0, Same old stuff: 1. There's not much point of writing a review on such an old movie and a predictable / semi-lame action film
1, stop being so critical....it's an action movie: i found this film very entertaining and well acted (especially by miko hughes as simon)
1, Great movie!: This was another great movie with Bruce Willis and Miko Hughes does a wonderful job as Simon. It brings some attention to autism.
1, Forensics Buff: Did not like the 12 Monkeys. This dvd collection is not for kids. Mercury rising is okay. The Jackal is a remake but the acting is good
1, Very good CD!: Being a fan of Megadeth
1, not bad: this album isnt good like megadeth albums but its not so bad dave is great rythem ... guitar player but you dont see in this album guitar riffs like in megdeth rust in peace- countdown - and youatnsia if your megadet hfun buy this if your not mega fun dont buy this /.
1, Good service: The video I ordered came on time and there were no problems with it not working. I'm satisfied with the service!
1, Father Goose and Mister Roberts: Got both of these movies off of Amazon for my husband. We both love the older movies. The grandkids love them too. Our son has so many and they have movie night on the weekend.
1, Father Goose: This is a movie classic. It stars Cary Grand and Leslie Caron. It is a comedy about a drifter living out in the south pacific who gets corralled into being a plane spotter for the British Navy during World War II. But to ad insult to injury
0, slightly boring...: It seems like after Keith Murray's second album
1, Too Def Squad: I don't know what you other people are thinking when you only give it 1-3 stars
0, Their live shows have slipt.: If Pearl Jam really cared about putting out a great live DVD
0, Train cannot stay on track for even a few seconds!: I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option. When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going
0, Defective product
0, Terribly made and pictures are too soft: I am very disappointed with the Canon 20D. My first disappointment is with the sharpness of the pictures. I've tried all kinds of combinations for the auto and manual functions
0, The book made NO sense!!!: It was confusing. The plotline kept switching and it was hard to follow
1, What si the Meaning of Life?: The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a Modern Classic. Read it
1, Funny Details: The random details that are found on every page of this book are really what make it THE BEST BOOK EVER!There is a story behind every little detail- and always a funny one. At first
1, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The book is a first edition hard cover Douglas Adams book
1, Believe the hype!: A highly entertaining novel. Extremely original and probably the funniest book I've ever read. I love British humour. I'm not a fan of sci-fi
0, Highly disoriented display of imagination: Except for the pun and humourous quotes sprinkled at the right places
0," at least it's short: Because it makes so many ""best of"" SF lists"
1, A Silly Comedy
1, Deux Ex Adams: One of the funniest books ever written by a slightly disturbed writer. :-)Laugh!- at Arthur DentCry!- at MarvinWonder!- What The **** Zaphrod Has Been SmokingScream!- In terror of the ZargonsThe Hitchhikers' guide to the Galaxy: Written in a time when men were still real men

1, CAN'T PUT IT DOWN: My dad had me read this when I was twelve. By the time I was thirteen
0, The author had no point.: I didn't enjoy the book a whole lot. I guess it was a guys book. It was a bunch of made up words and childish jokes. I didn't absolutley hate it
0, Not a great book: Even though this book was very funny
0, Kindle edition - poor conversion of a good book: No need to review the text
0, uggh: The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a very good book. It describes many things in life. Some are adventure
1, MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME: I have read all the hitchhiker books at least a dozen times! I actually read two of them in one night. If you haven't read it already do so.
0, Didn't keep me interested: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams was one very strange book. If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all
1, A classic!: I first read this book in college some 20 years ago
1, Brings back wonderful childhood memories: My nana
1, A Must See: I cant believe it has taken me this long to watch this wonderful movie. Acting is great and the scenery is awesome. This is a 2box of kleenex movie. I was moved beyoond belief.
1, Just AMAZING!: I didn't know what life was and what it had to offer until I saw Anne series. Anyone who's got a good heart is required to see it.
0, Anne of Green Gables: I must clear up what someone wrote in another review. I do believe this film was shot in Nova Scotia Canada but not Prince Edward Island Nova Scotia as Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island are two seprate Canadian Provinces. I love this movie I could watch it over and over. I think this Canadian classic is a must see for all in and outside Canada.Dallas QuennellSouthampton
1, heart wrenching: This has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Even the mini-series
1, Great Green Gables DVD!: While reviews of the other version of this DVD were lacking to say the least
1, Love this Series: i purchased this series and absolutely love it. gave it 4 stars because the sound quality wasn't the best and the final movie wasn't the original i remember from when i was a child. none-the-less
1, It captures your heart: This heart warming film
0, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!: Very disappointed! The first side was fine
0, Agree with the previous comment: Totally loved it
0, Who wrote this garbage? Who's directing it?: Season One was great. Good idea. Good actors. Season two was written by someone who thinks the more words coming out of the actors' mouths
1, Fantastic and one of my favorites: Fantastic film. The central four characters work best as an ensemble
1, Great Fun: Dark comedy about rival gangs persuing the same pile of money and marijuana
1, Good 'ol time in England: This is a great movie to see. A group of friends get in debt to a major gangster. They have to get 500K in seven days or else. Each the story that ensues is amazing and hilarious. Other gangs unknowingly become entangled in the plot and everyone has their own agenda that eventually leads to an amazing collision. The dialogue and cinematograhy are top notch in this film. It is a must see.

0, These mini-series really suck: Ok so once again it took me about an hour or two to read this book. All I can say is I'm not impressed. This book was 10 times more interesting than MISTY
1, great compilation
1, excellent: An excellent piece of jazz-cum-rock-cum-latin and whatever have you
1, Kewl!: I loved this book! The Net's everything! I do my papers
0, Made no sense!: This movie was confusing. It sets up a wonderful beginning with a bunch of people ( a playwright
0, Best Forgotten: Directors and writers have a learning curve and this was part of Mr. Robbin's. What did he do right? The film has a professional polish to its acting and editing. What's bad? Under dramatized scenarios follow one another like beads on a string. This goes on for two whole hours. I could only stand to watch it in segments. And of course it's politically skewed way to the Left. There is no middle class represented amongst the characters-none of the 85% who stayed working at their jobs after 1929. Characters are either 1) out of work
0, Book lacks in-depth coverage.: I was disappointed with this book
0, Bad
1, Humorous and Lovable Movie: This is an hilarious movie with romance and love at the core. It depicts the story we have come to expect with retiring Presidents
0, Very little substance: I found this book to be be repetitive
1," Develop mastery with the power of an hour: Power of an Hour by Dave Lakhani delivers powerful ideas of what to do with an hour. The premise of this book is that an hour consistently applied to a particular task or subject will produce mastery in a relatively short time. I agree with Lakhani's idea that a fastidious attention to time is needed to accomplish great things and that guarding those ""power hours"" from all interruptions will indeed create mastery. So whether you are looking at improving finances"

1, Better than I thought: I bought this music box for my 4 yr old daughter. She loves it !! It is perfect for her little hands to hold with out dropping. She loves that it lights up when she opens the lid. I am very happy with what I got for the price and I will more then likely buy more from the collection.
1, It's actually pretty good!: Ok...This book wasn't like OMG I love it

1, Convexoptimization reference: This book can be considered as a reference in convex optimization.It is clearly written with a lot of examples.
1, Fun & Worth Having.: A wonderful cookbook for the beginner &/or seasoned cook. Easy to read
1, Delivery problem: The cans of formula were convenient
0, Bad customer experience...Need help!!!: I ordered 3 boxes of these
0, I have to disagree: Primary Colors is not a good film. John Travolta's Bill Clinton imitation starts wearing on the nerves very quickly and his accent is a crime against nature. Emma Thompson who is normally great is bland here. The only three people who really shine and almost make this a worthwile film are Billy Bob Thornton
0, slow&boring: this is a poor attempt on Bill Clinton&crew.in fact a movie is supposed to be fantasy but this one lags in excitement.it's a waste of time.the real Life Bill Clinton is far more interesting than this screen version.and that's not fantasy but fact.
1, Strange and stranger!: Klinger's 19th century etchings are Freudian dreams and his superior body of work is the link between the 18th century etchings of Goya and the 20th century art of Dali
0, bad experience: had a bad experience getting the product from box wave. I had been looking forward to receiving the product
0, No customer service: I had this product for two weeks and starting having problems. Blinking yellow LED
0, Cheaply made- not worth buying them: Lets' face it; sometimes the price of an item will tell you the quality. I am used to buying $15-$20 tweezers but I thought I would buy the Luma Tweeze Pro as I need another pair of tweezers. Well

1, Director's log: (Pitch Black) is an unrated movie about transporting forty passengers and one Furian murderer. The ship gets caught in a meteor shower
1, Pitch Black
1, Excellent flick!: This was great movie! Great effects! I bought it not knowing much about the storyline. It turns out
1, How do I get eyes like that?: Ok
1, Pitch Black: The horror genre was thought to have died a well deserved death. The Freddy and Jason movies had driven the genre into the ground and present horrow films have been very lackluster. Pitch Black and Final Destination have been brought respect back to the genre. Pitch Black is an amazing film. It is more than just an Alien-CLone. The movie has a very smart script and dialogue. The characters are not cardboard creations. They are real people with emotions and fears. The creatures are scary
1, Great Sci Fi and excellent special effects.: Very original story about a planet with 3 Suns and a coming eclipse to become the mother of all eclipses. Excellent original story and well played out with great special effects. You have to get past some of the non human creatures looking a lot like Predator but other than that a good movie.
1, Watch this if you like Sy Fy: This is a multi tiered

0," Wonderful Movie - Poor DVD Quality: The previous reviewer wrote: ""It's a beautiful"
0, G? Rating More like Porn rating-Be Warned: OK
1," Confused?: I watched this film on the Independent Film Channel maybe 10 years ago. My recollection of it is that it is an excellent film. I came here to purchase this film and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" (also excellent) on dvd. I read various reviews rated from 5 to 1 stars and am now wondering if this film on dvd is the same one I watched so long ago. Has it been reformated? Have scenes been deleated or added? I read that some ppl who recalled it as an excellent film were somewhat disappointed after the passage of time. Is this due to a change in the format of the film? I recall the storyline and Australian scenery as awesome. Can someone tell me if the dvd release has changed the film"
1, Defective Discs: I loved this movie when I saw it on cable many years back
0, Disappointed after reading great reviews: This movie got great reviews so I looked forward to watching it. I'm an Aussie living overseas so like to watch as many Aussie movies as I can

0, This crap is not true Willie
0, Won't Last Long: I bought this watch a little over a year ago. Yesterday it started ringing and found that the battery needed to be changed. Spent $7.25 to have battery changed
1, Great so far: As for longevity I cannot speak - only had it a week. But its a solid watch. Seems very well built to me. Nice to have an analog with the dependability of a digital alarm. Though the leather band is quality I actually replaced the band with a Timex Expedition Fast Wrap for a river trip & I don't think I'll be replacing it any time soon - great band and the 20mm size fits the watch well.Note that despite what some sites say this watch (T45191) allows for tracking 2 timezones and not 3
0," Totally sucks.: Ever click on somebody's crappy web page from 1995 and think ""Jesus Christ"
1, Fun addition to Harry Potter collection: I did not purchase this for a child
1, ESL/Thievery Always Deliver.: To me Thievery can do no wrong so I was super happy to come across this cd. Has some tracks that most die hard fans will have on other ESL/Thievery releases but all in all a great mix. If you like Thievery and that type of music
0, Leaves you hanging! Asks questions that never get answered.: While I was initially intrigued by the premise behind this book---spaceship wandering aimlessly
0, aimless terror: This is the story of a spaceship that travels through space for no discernible reason. It has a ruling class and a huge cathedral
1, A true friend
0, Great book
1, A French Language Classic: I love this book and story. It is certainly geared for the young and the older person as well yet told by an amazing author. The story is delightful and presents many unique scenarios from a child's point of view. It is a story of exploration and discovery. There are many lessons to be learned and morals to be valued. The story is also accompanied by child like drawings which almost transform the reader intoeach magical realm of discovery.
1, If you decide to read this book
0, ummm...i must be a moron: Someone please shoot me in the face

1," Metallica is still the best: After about 20 years Metallica is still giving the fans what they want! Casual or die-hard fans alike will love this DVD. The ""destruction"" scene is worth the price itself. The only way this could have been any better is if there would have been multiple camera angles in all the songs. Keep on Rocking James!"
1, Kick ... Performance!: Man this was great.I'll have to agree it felt like I was at the concert LIVE.This video was second to none.The only MetallicA video that even comes near this good is S&M.So if you are a die hard METALLICA FAN you MUST get this NOW it ROCKS!!!!!Oh as James said he would he sang as loud as a F...

1, Great Cast: Pittsburgh area college professor Michael Douglas faces a slew of crises as he struggles to complete the follow-up to his successful first novel.
0, GREAT PERFORMANCES BUT ....: Michael Douglas astonished me. He's perfect here as the professor. But why on Earth the history had the show the outcast brilliant student ( Tobey MAcGuire ) being gay alongside RObert Downey's character ???!! THe scene where they appear together in bed was so unecessary and bad tasted
0, low battery: It works like a music box--when you open it
1, cute jewelry box: I got this as a gift for a friend that collects music jewelry box. It is in fact bigger than the picture shows. I find it very cure
1, shame on bad critics: I loved this movie
0, this was a waste of $3.98: Matt Damon is going in the same direction John Travolta went in the 1980's. and Greg Kinnear is begging to be the next host of Hollywood Squares. I'll take Jim J. Bullock to block
1, Enjoyable...not best of Farrelly Brothers though: Stuck on you made me laugh
1, Great physical comedy!: Enough people have summarized the plot so no need for that. What I liked about this film is the very smooth choreography between Damon and Kinnear. They really do move as if they've been together -- long enough. I don't know how many 'takes' it took
0, A TV movie: Good hearted
0, Has Excel-related topics
0," One of the Worst CDs ever: The only reason to own this CD is if you enjoy ""showing off"" really bad music to your friends and family. ""You've got to hear this...it's so bad!"" Some of the songs on the album are instrumental"
1, just excellent: tingling all over
1," It grows and grows on you: I bought this album on a whim. I really liked Southside's ""I don't want a lover"" way back in 89/90 and thought this was going to be as gutsy. I was very much mistaken"
1, Fantabulous!: texas has to be one of the bestest bands in the world. the first time i sampled it at the cd shop
0, Danger Danger Will Robinson: Quite simply
1, Honesty
1," ""This is Howard Cosell"": GREAT BOOK!! Even though it was written 20+ years ago"
1, will use for many road trips to come: This was a most helpful book in helping us to plan our Pacific Coastline trip. Will use it again for a Southern expedition.
1, bought for a gift: I think my husband's parents will love this book since they like to take long road trips. This book is bigger than I expected and very thick. More of a coffee table
0, Too dark and limited: I did not like this film at all. I think it is useless to comment about its hostorical incorrectness: the preceding reviews have been really exaustive. What I would like to talk about is the film's atmosphere. Too dark. Renaissance times were not so gloomy. esides
0, EMOTIONLESS: If the puporse of the director was only showing history
0, I wish I could have given it 0 stars: I really wish I could have given it negative stars.This movie is terrible. Others have pointed out the many
0, This movie remined me of a commercial: Elzabeth was a compressed
1, Good but....: You certainly can't fault any performances in this film. Cate Blanchett is superlative. She fascinates. The story and characters pull you in. But it has a strange sort of pacing to it
1, Elizabeth: Elizaneth is a great look into a tumultuous time period. There is some artistic license ( the putting on the stone makeup in kind of weird
1, Elizabeth - the Edited Version: While the DVD was of excellent technical quality and arrived earlier that expected
1, Excellent acting and filming!!: If you love period films you'll love this one! The costumes
0," Different Elizabeth: When I watched ""Elizabeth"""
0, Elizabeth the Silly School Girl: A work of fiction is a great thing
0, This film is an insult to the people whose names it uses.: It might be pretty - I don't know
0," Don't Bother: This film only merits two stars to give credit to the costume and set designers. The rest is pure trash. The script sounds like it was written by a bad romance novelist and the historical inaccuracies are amazing. The characters are pure stereotype. If you are intersted in a dramatization of Elizabeth's life you would be better off going to the old ""Elizabeth"" series with Glenda Jackson. Even the 70's movie ""Mary"
1, Elizabeth is Nearly Accurate Historically: Elizabeth is a great movie which accommodates both the world of facts and history with the world of entertainment and Hollywood. The movie is a relatively accurate historically
1," Elizabeth is fantastic!: I'm so glad there are so many other reviewers who think that ""Elizabeth"" is a marvelous film. And I'm glad someone pointed out that this is NOT A DOCUMENTARY. It is a story which combines both fact and fiction to create intense drama.And Cate Blanchett's rich"

1, simply wonderful: What can I say
0, awful script
0, Horrible!: Am I the only person who hated this film? I was bored to death during it and couldn't wait for it to end. It just shows how little imagination Hollywood has left that they would put out this piece of trash on a brilliant man like Shakespeare. I did not think that Gwyneth Paltrow's acting deserved the Oscar for this one.
1, 3 and a half: This is the third half I've given in a row. Amazon

0, Not much depth and it won best picture?!?: The best thing abot this movie was Joseph Fiennes. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance wasn't worth anything
0, Shakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series): Not impressed. Bought this as a gift for someone and they lent it back to me to watch. Wasted my time and money
1, Worth every nickel!: I loved the movie in the theater and am now so glad to have the DVD. Shakespeare is made interesting
0, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!!!: This may not be the worst movie ever made but it comes pretty darn close! From reading the other reviews I knew that I would either love it or hate it
1, Much better live: The problem with this otherwise wonderful record is the muddy
1, Awesome: This is definitely an album worth getting. Neil's intoxicating melodies and vocals are back with full force. There's some really outstanding songwriting here
0, Bad pressing
0," Try listening to this: Aside from ""Sinner"" and ""She Will Have Her Way"
1, Step outside your brain with Hunter Thompson as your guide.: Fans of Hunter S Thompsons works will really enjoy this DVD. Director Terry Gilliam does a great job of bringing the now cult novel 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' to the screen. Gilliam vividly depicts Vegas through the eyes of our heroes Raul Duke and Dr Gonzo.Not a movie for the whole family
1, A Surreal Trip: One of the most faithful adaptations of a literary work ever put on the big screen. Terry Gilliam
0, Dont buy this crap: The book fear and loathing in las vegas
1, weird movie but i like it: My husband saw this movie and thought I would love it. It is very weird to me but there are some funny parts and I'm a Depp fan and I think he did a good job acting but all I can say is good thing it was cheap :) My husband is happy with the purchase....
1, ...when the drugs began to take hold...: This movie is not for the faint of mind. It is from start to finish a whirlwind of drug-frenzies
1, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Hilarious early Jonny Depp movie. Depicts the drug culture in a very humorous way!
1, BAT COUNTRY?????: What can I say?? Best movie EVER! My husband is a huge fan of this movie and I had never seen it in its entirety
1, Who had the trip?: This is not a film I would normally choose. The title did warn me.In part I watched because Johnny Depp is in it

1, Skills board review: 1&1/2 year old loves this puzzle. It is a little hard to do alone as some of the things are difficult for her but we enjoy it!
1, Great mix of yoga and pilates: I love this DVD. It's a great workout mixing both yoga and pilates using the balance ball. It has a great flow to it. I also enjoy the music. Happy feeling! I especially apreciate the introduction course giving lots of advice on how to advance or work as a beginner with the ball.

0, NOT THE ORIGIONAL SOUNDTRACK: This isn't the same as the origional
1, Long live the Hammond B-3: The Hammond B-3 never sounded better...or so loud...(though Greg Rollie's B-3 really cooked on the first Santana albums).....Long live Lee
1, ...Timeless -- and still fresh-sounding: What a great memory trigger this recording is....Remember hearing side-two of this album as a high-schooler out in the Los Angeles area
1, Exciting Album: This is an absolutely sensational album. Considering there are only two musicians on it delivering an incredible amount of energy using only the Hammond B3 and a drum set! The opening cut takes you by surprise but the rendition of Stormy Monday is not just my favorite cut on the album but what I thought is the best cover of that most popular blues tune. This is an excellent album representative of the late 60's - early 70's musical era!
0, Not your typical
1, The Only Way to Play With Bondo !: Sure makes cleanup a breeze.Easy to hold and mix epoxy or body filler on.Just wish it was refillable.
1, I really enjoyed this book.: As a biracial teenager I was delighted to read a book that addresses the issue of race identity. Judy Scales-Trent makes some excellent points regarding race divisions in today's society. Not only does Ms. Scales-Trent present her information in such a way that anyone can identify with

0, show skinks: I feel the same way A Norwood felt. After a couple of eposides I was bored out of my mind. The charactors are stupid but are not funny. If you want stupid and funny

0, NOT MUCH TO SEE: I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS DVD GETS (****). MY OPINION IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS FILM YOU DONT LOST TOO MUCH.
1, Lush: I didn't get into Maxwell or buy this CD until 2006. After enjoying his videos on VH1Soul I decided I wanted to hear more. I knew I wanted Urban Hang Suite and Now but I hesitated about buying Embrya. I'd read some negative reviews and it never got much airplay. I'm so glad I decided to hear it for myself. I believe that 99% of the negative reviews are because of the weird song titles and because it is not as funky as his debut. Play the entire CD once or twice and you will get past all of that and discover it for the lush romantic jewel that it is. The singles Luxury and Matrimony are feel good midtempo songs. Drowndeep is sensuous and sweet. Those are my favorite songs but this album has so much more to offer.
0, Not As Good As First Album: It doesn't swing as much as the first CD
1, Heaven on Earth: This Cd never gets old. I remember when it first came out and I wasn't really a Maxwell fan then and I hadn't bought his first one yet. It was in the record store and you could listen to it before you bought it and once I listened to it
1," Simply Wonderful: Maxwell's best album so far.The thick-ass bass on ""Everwanting: To Want You to Want"" is terrific; it is a great way to start off this album experience. Sets the stage perfectly""Drowndeep: Hula"" is a beautiful and intimate piece of music whose visual characteristics are really quite amazing. Gotta love those island women...or is it women islands?""Matrimony: Maybe You"" was the closest thing on this album to a hit"
1, Embrya: His words echo beyond the end of each song: I really enjoyed Maxwell's: Embrya. Unlike many artists out there
0, Very poor packaging: The packaging was very poor and so the product was damaged in route. The concern of the customer service people was also very poor. They basically stated take the extreemly heavy boxes back to the post office (the Post Office said they would not take them as they were to heavy) and ship them back. After they arrive we will send you new product.A real hassel so we did what we could to have them repaired. Suggest everyone else buy from a local store.
0, unrealistic view of the malagasy people and their island: madagascar is a beautiful island and the people are the friendliest i have ever encountered. after spending 4 months living and working among them i found that their devotion to God is second to none and their ability to find joy despite what the world would describe as humble circumstances is unparalleled. this disappointing book doesn't accurately portray madagascar nor the people who live there. personally it offends me and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1, 70's Guitar Rock Defined.: I used to listen to this album in '76 and now over 20 years later
1, Lots of creative energy from Oasis during this time: Looking back
0," Don't Do It! You'll Regret It!: This is such a dissapointing TV and the HP service is just the same. Less than 1 month outside of my warranty the TV has died. It's experiencing a phenomenon called ""pixel flare"". Google it. I'm not the only one. I have no choices as per the rude HP customer service rep (yes"
1, Mid-weight sport sock.: Was happy with this product. Did not shrink and was color fast. It is very hard to find brown - so was really happy about that.
0, The Impostress: The story begins as a girl falls from her horse. She is in a forest
0, What Happened to this Previously Brilliant Author?: I read this after reading all of his other works - what a disappointment! He contradicts his other works and goes on about fighting the Grays and submitting to some Goddess with firery eyes. This is not compatible with his other teachings and seems full of struggle. All of his previous works focus on creating your own reality and choosing to see what you want to see - where as in this book he seems to have given up to some other power and seems lost. The book left me with an overall feeling of despondency.It was all a bit sad
0, I threw it in the trash in one day!: I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is riddled with new-age and eastern mysticism. It is lacking any solid documentation for the author's claims which are so outlandish it was hard to believe anyone would publish this book. I was truly disappointed. Don't bother buying it.
0," Should be titled ""How to Succeed in Commercial Real Estate BROKERAGE"": I was disappointed with the book. I expected a book that would describe how to succeed in commercial real estate for someone wanting to buy and lease out commerical properties. This book hardly touched on the topics I wanted to learn about"
1, Great tool to educate anyone who gets involved in Hispanic mktg: I am finishing chapter 6 and I am truly enjoying it. It is quite straight forward
1," A ""Must Read"": This book was a great adventure to read and re-read for me. The business principles used by P.T. Barnum over 100 years ago are still very much applicable and appropriate for today. Keeping his (Barnum) focus and positive attitude in the face of adversity gave me pause to reflect on my own business experiences and challenges. Joe Vitale did an excellent job of researching and presenting the material. I highly recommend this book."
0, Not at all what I expected: The book was like hearing a story at a party from some guy who can't tell stories. I was waiting and waiting for the part about the airplanes - since the title is about airplanes
1, punk done right: While certainly not mxpx's best effort it is a great debut on A&M. with the consistant great musicianship and tightness MxPx always didplays they invoke pure punk joy for any true punk fan. Plus theres the cover of the Cootees great i'm ok you're ok. take the mainstream boys full steam ahead!
0, only in America: Only in America could people get away with this stuff. I'm a big fan of punk
0, Dissapointing: I'm going to have to disagree with these folks on this one
1, A unique find: I haven't read a Harlequin book in years and have never read one from the Flipside series. The title had me interested
1, At his best: I have read this book twice now and even liked it better the second time through. There are really three good stories going on here. One with the clouds themselves
1, Joe Black: This is an awesome take on how death and life can change in a blink of an eye and it keeps you guessing what will happen next.
0, too long
1, Great movie: I love this movie. When I got it it was in great shape! And worked just fine.I only give it four stars because it took forever to get in the mail.
1, Deliciously slower paced for emotional involvement.: This film is a tour-de-force of acting for both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. The pacing appears slow at first but once you adapt to it it is the pacing that allows the personalities to evolve
1, Brad Pitt YUM YUM: IF DEATH WAS GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE I KNEW I WOULD WANT THEM TO LOOK JUST LIKE JOE BLACK
1, A Modern Classic: I consider this to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It took me by surprise...I had seen the DVD in stores numerous times and never even considered renting or buying it; then a friend told me about it and loaned me the Ultimate Edition DVD. The acting was superb
1, One of the best romances ever!: First of all I love this movie! The emotions this movie emotes in my heart is something no movie of this type has ever done. It's a very compelling story and it's very well acted. I don't think the critics gave the movie much credit but I think this movie is amazing. I saw in the theaters and now I've seen it numurous times on my DVD and it still has the same effect on me as the first time I watched this awesome piece of film. In fact it got better for me as I saw it over and over. The emotions that are acted out on the screen are so real to me that I get tears in my eyes. I love this movie and I recommend it to any romance/drama movie fan. There is no other movie like it.
1, Real close to a 5 star!!: I was expecting this movie to be sooo hilarious
1, EXCELLENT
1, Great movie: I love this movie and the charecter Madea! VERY funny! Tyler Perry's characters are so hilarious! My goal is to own the entire collection
0, AWFUL!: This movie had the most pointless plot and sappy dialouge i have ever seen. The romance in the movie was completely ruined by the cheap
0, Used copy damaged: The movie was great up until the last 10 minutes and it started skipping whole scenes. Because I had seen the movie before I knew there were parts missing. I believe the used copy is damaged. It was my first time purchasing a used item from Amazon. I was disappointed and not sure if I can return for replacement.
1, I mean!!!: This movie is about HOPE and I have to say
1, One of those movies you share with everyone you know!: I first saw this film in college. Later
0, it doesn't know weather it wants to be a comedy or a drama: The acting was wooden. The direction seemed nearly non existent
1," A Gold Medal Book!: This book offers a great insight into the ""psyche"" of an Olympic athlete. It was interesting"
1, A well written and thought provoking book.: This book provided me w/ plenty of food for thought on a very difficult subject - religion. The author makes a very strong case for one based on ethics
1, Modern Bride Presents the Wedding Album: I bought this record because of a specific music. (Promise Ain't Enough - Haal & Oates). I already looked for it a long time. I found it in this album that
1, Had to have: I'm getting my Montessori teaching certification for infants and toddlers and saw this in a classroom I observed. It's perfect to help refine fine motor skills ad teach cause and effect.
1, Wow skills!!: My son has Ot issues with hand movements
1, latches board: This is a great learning and fun toy
0, Not so thrilled: I thought it looked like a great toy
0, Pinches tiny fingers: My son tries to manipulate the latches and just gets pinched! It works great with older children who already have the fine motor skills to work the puzzle
1, Grandson loves it.: Our grandson has an acute ability for solving puzzles. At 18 months old we saw him put together wooden puzzles that were age appropriate for 2 and 3 year old children. This puzzle is more of a challenge for him as he has mastered 3 of the latches and he loves trying to manipulate the others. It is very educational as it also teaches counting.
1, Great Puzzle Experience: The puzzles was a great learning resource for our son. He continues to work on his fine motor skills with the latches and locks. I would recommend it to any parents who is looking for a puzzles with a difference. Thank you.
1, Mom of 2yr old: My son loves opening and closing all the doors on this puzzle. However
0, Disappointed: Some of these locks are enough of a challenge but others just fall open almost without any help at all. The chain one and the hook and loop one never stay locked for a child to unlock them. This is too easy for any children to do more than a few times.
0, La primera Catalina si q era una libertinaje: Este libro me a sacado de quicio más de una ves los personajes son injustos unos con otros mirando siempre por si mismos son egoístas y interrumpen la felicidad de otros sólo por orgullo propio no me a quedado interés alguno en volver a leer este libro aunque se aprende bastante de lo infeliz q se puede ser cuando pierdes el amor de tu vida es triste he incomprendido toda la historia es bastante descabellada en fin cada quien con su opinión
0, historia amarga: Antes que nada decir que de las hermanas bronte el único que me gustó fue Jane Eyre a pesar de ser muy triste la historia
1, Little Hamlet: The Land I Lost
1, Clothes line works great!!: I purchased the Whitney Design indoor/outdoor retractable clothes line
0, Don't even try it !: THIS IS A -Star(negative) as it won't let me have no stars at all.This is the worst product ever
0, NOT RECOMMENDED!: 5-Line Retractable Clothes DryerHousehold Essentials 3-Piece Clothesline Post Designed for the Household Essential 15 by 7-Inch Retractable DryerBought test two items together and thought it would work well for my back yard. I put the retractable clothes dryer on the side of the house and put the pole about 34ft away. But once we put the clothes on the line (after locking the lines in place as instructed) the lines severely drooped and some of the clothes were even touching the ground. Also the clothes in the middle did not dry as well as the clothes on the outside
1, If I Could I Would Give It 10 Stars.: I love all the NBA Streets series. Missing Michael Jordan but who cares this game is still fun as hell. The graphics are beautiful. I'm the King of this game
0, A Terrible Sequel to the Wonderful Movie Babe: Hello
0, They didn't know what to do with this one: Babe: Pig in the City is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It was strange
0, Babe- Pig in the City: Dark
1, Babe
0, NOT VERY GOOD: THIS IS SOME WHAT CHARMING BUT THE MOVIES SEEMS TO BE ONE BIG TRAGEDY AFTER THE NEXT.THE THE LAST MINS ARE TOTALY UNFUNNY SLAPSTICK.ALSO WAS WAS JAMES CROWELL NOT IN THE MOVIE MORE HE WAS PART OF THE MAGIC OF THE FRIST ONE.I WAS VERY DISSAPIONTED WITH THIS.
0, One of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen: Do not show this movie to your children unless you want to give them nightmares. It almost gave ME nightmares
0," Babe in the Trash - do not waste your money!: I was so disappointed with BABE: Pig in the City! The 1st was fun and the kids loved it.The 2nd version is ""too scary"" for children. It is mean"
0, Too soft to be happy: I was happy first as i received the mattress
1, Nice happy Fluke stuff!: I actually have the vinyl version of this
0, Not good: It was over price and stale. I threw them all away. Very
0, Seriously
0, Great Depression: I recommend people watching this movie with their TV set on 'mute'
0, waist of money: This was formatted in german and didn't say that anywhere. don't purchase movies from this person. Wish that i would have returned it.
0, Unhappy Customer: I wasnt happy with product i received as I was unable to use it in this country.... and part from that it looked like a copy DVD .... it was a cstly exercise for me and but I have learned not to make this mistake again
1, what dreams my come: This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. When I first saw in the theaters
1, Visual delight with ethical dilemmas: I enjoy Robin William's in off beat non comedic roles and this is certainly one of them. The artistry and visual tools used are very intriguing yet the reason I purchased this was for the heaven/hell/suicide/power of love conflict. Film brought out many interesting dilemmas. And Cuba's performance is always solid.
0, Read the book: I agree with those who were disappointed with poor film of a great book. Stars are for visuals only.Plot changed a lot from book. Guess getting rid of the kids cut down on salaries.Think the only movie I've ever seen that was as good as the book was TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Every would-be adaptive screen writer should be required to study both book and film BEFORE beomg allowed to attempt the same.
0, Surrelistic
0, Bored me to death: This movie had me in tears.. from so much yawning! It presents someone's view of what comes after death; If you're good
0, Boring and typical Robin Williams facial expressions: I got the DVD version because I wanted to see this beautiful movie in better resolution and sound which they are really good. But I agree with the other viewers who said this movie is depressing and boring. I just have to add to those comment about Robin Williams acting. He is a good actor but when it comes to dramatic roles
1," Loved Even By A Truck Driver: My husband picked up this DVD while we were out shopping and I was stunned. I knew I wanted to see it....but HIM. We watched it that very night and we both absolutely loved it. It is visually incredible and right up there with ""Somewhere in Time"" for my all time favorite love story. Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. are remarkable. The special effects awesome. The story line one of a kind and very much in line with todays open mindedness about reincarnation. If my ""Big Ole Truck Driving Husband"" is man enough to be touched by it"
1, This is by far the best movie I have ever seen
0, Rent This Movie To Help You Sleep...: I was bored to tears by this movie. I usually like this kind of movie...I don't know what happened with this one.
0, Visually stunning?: I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious
0, I agree: I agree with the other people who gave this movie 1 star. This movie is boring. This movie is very boring. In fact
0, Not as cool as I remember.: I wish I hadn't bought it. I don't like this movie at all. It arrived on time and played like new
0, Delivery fine - Product
0, Abysmal commentary
1, Best of the options...: Given that the best pencils are expensive and Rose art and Crayola don't last past one or two sharpenings
0, Unlike any other Alice
0, rip-off
1, Nice style
1, gritty realism...: Michael Connelly is an amazing author. He brings the dark side of life into view without losing the gritty edge of reality of his characters. Harry Bosch is a detective in L.A. who takes on an investigation of a dead child from years past when a bone turns up on a hillside. He pursues the case
1, Good book...: Sorry for my english
1, I remember Harry: I have to agree with other reviews that this is not one of Michael Connelly's tighter story lines. It felt very disjointed to me at several places. However
0, Horrible!: The movie I got was not a real movie! It said DVD but when I put the DVD in there it was only a small screen in the top left corner if the screen. It was a waste of my money!
1, The First Lady of Country Music...: An AMAZING performance by Sissy Spacek
1, Good starter set: This is an excellent basic starter kit for N scale model railroading. It is good value for money.
0," Not worth more than $7: The only reason this thing costs $20 is because it's a brand name and they use catchy buzz words like ""200tc"" and other worthless phrases designed to make you feel like you've made a good purchase.Here's what you don't get. A quality mattress pad that you won't have to replace next year.Aside from the cheap cotton top"
1, Black Beauty: I love this book I would give it a 5star rating 
0, Good looks
0, Poor construction: This product was the best I've owned when it comes to staying in the ear and sound quality but the earpiece came apart after a few weeks. I was going to buy another but this has happened to too many people.
0, If you want to waste your money
0, not very durrable: out of the box it worked great
0, How bad? Let me count the ways...: I bought one of these
0, Average
0, Leprechaun 4 - In space: Leprechaun 4- In Space was not like the first three Leprechaun movies
0, Aliens for everybody: In the future of man kind
1, funny as hell: this is bad
0, Mindless and Low-Budget: In all honesty
1, Super Sticky Once or Twice: Super Sticky PostItNotes are super sticky
0, Hungarian Folk : 50s-60s Style: In spite of the fetching picture of the Bulgarian ladies on the cover
1, Great movie
1," Get it you won't regret it: I could rate this ten stars! Everyone in the reviews above has divulged their version of ""the heart of"" this movie and the motivation behind the scientist's and James' actions. Yet I can only tell you that it is a movie that you can relate to"
1, Fine Surreal Film: Terry Gilliam at his best. I love the sylishness of surreal films
0, Brad Pitts Character Too Over the Top: I felt the movie had potential (especially after reading the reviews) until the director introduces Brad Pitts’ character. This overly manic character went on for too long for my taste. It was exhausting and distracting. From this point through another 30 minutes
1, 12 Monkeys Brad: This movie is really great
0, Just a mishmash of hype: 12 Monkeys is a very tedious film. Even once you realize whats really going on
1, great deal: I could not locate any copies where they said to shop
0, Who is Reading this?: I think the material in this audio book is amazing.I have a hard time getting through it because of the actor chosen to read the text.His voice and affectations are beyond annoying.I wish careful consideration would be given when it comes to choosing who is to read for the audio book!
0, Readable but not enjoyable: As an avid reader
1, Robert Jacks is the best Leatherface ever!: Finally Leatherface has a voice! These people really got hurt- all of what the original intended finishes off wiyh this one. Scream
0, even worse than the 7th heaven remake: this is my vote for 3rd worst movie ever made.its dumb
0, Still Stunned: If Plan Nine From Outer Space is still the worst movie ever made then this clunker is the worst movie ever made in color. At first I couldn't believe my eyes and then I wanted to poke them out.
0, Plan 9 from Outerspace it maybe time to hand over your crown: Parts 2 & 3 are Citizen Kane-caliber classics compared to this dross. Uses same plot of demented chainsaw family terrorizing a hapless group (this time teens on prom night). More like a remake than a sequel
0, Crap: Pure crap.A very massive disgrace to the texas chainsaw series.No plot
0, Inferior compare to others: This movie is watchable
0," ""Welcome... to myyyyy world!"": ...And it isn't pretty. ""The Next Generation"" is a stain on the legacy of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ""The Next Generation"" is a campy attempt to emulate Tobe Hooper's masterpiece "
0, don't do it: DO NOT
0, alright: This chainsaw sequel was Ok. I really honestly think it could have been a all around better sequel
0, Horrible movie! The worst yet!: This movie is so stupid. It's not a sequel it's just a very (***) attemp to remake the first one. My advice is to avoid this movie at all costs. It's so bad it doesn't deserve a star! If you want to see a good TCM movie watch the first two. And
0," Piece of s***: Well I thought that part 3 was the worst in the series but then came along ""the Next Generation"" and it proved me wrong. Here are reasons why I think the latest ""Chainsaw"" movie sucks.1. Wasn't even a sequel really"
0, Texas Chainsaw Crapsacre: This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III
0, Oh Dear!: What can I say
1, nice large face that is easy to read: Well made and easy to read. Both with standard dial hands and digital time. nice metal case and back. Easy to program and set. I thought the strap was Velcro
0, Dead after three years: I bought a Timex Expedition about three years ago. The buttons no longer work
1, nice watch -- what I was looking for: nice watch --- I like it as it is not too big and does not weigh much at all. So far....so good!!
1, SOUTH OF THE BORDER SOUNDS: I AM BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT ON MARIACHI MUSIC
1, Not the usually R. Kelly
0, R. Kelly: I DIDN'T GET TO ENJOY THE C D BECAUSE IT WAS STRATCHED WHEN I GOT IT. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK TO THE SENDER.
0, Cliched and mediocre: The Bottom Line:With its exploding grass shacks
0," Better than Lord of the Rings?: Well...I guess there really is ""no accounting for taste.""But"
1, first and best: One of the best Tom Berenger movies since Platoon. The next sniper movies didn't even come close. Billy Zane acts well in this movie compared to others.
1, This was the GREATEST movie I have ever seen.: When I first saw this movie
1," Excellent shoes!: I've been searching everywhere for a ""plain"" shoe without too many ""lines"" on it as well as with a rubber sole. I came across a pair of black ones (or red?) and bought them but couldn't find the other color. I was very happy when I found them on Amazon. The shoe looks great and I use it at work (business casual) or when going out/dates/events. It is VERY comfortable. The only minor downside is that it is slightly expensive - when I ordered it"
0, Paint chips off easily: Works great but 4 months after installing the paint is chipping off and looks terrible. Better off spending the extra money on the good one
1, Boingo in mellow times: I'm glad to see the positive reviews of this album. The AMG site reviews most of the Boingo catalog as below average
0, The WORST Boingo CD: I am blown away seeing all these 4-star and 5-star ratings for this CD. This is Boingo's absolute worst CD. When I make a best songs compilation
1, Excellent flashlight....: I got this flashlight because I needed it to be durable and waterproof or at least water resistant. I also didn't want to spend a ton. This flashlight fits the bill. Seems durable
0, Real options note covered: This book does not cover the frontier of investment analysis
0, Worst book I've ever read: I gave this book one star because Amazon.com didn't give me an option to give less. This one is so bad it actually sucks stars from other books like a black hole.I've read many Koontz books before and was absolutely shocked at the poor quality of the story. My response after reading this was
0, No Zero Star Rating? Bummer: I'm so thrilled to be able to write my review because it means that the book is over and I can now donate it to my local library. B-O-R-I-N-G.Also
0, Not like his usual: I have attempted to read By the Light of the Moon several times on my commute to work. I have read many of Koontz's novels and this one is very hard to get into. I find the characters annoying and their constant bickering is very tedious. I have only read 100 pages
0, By the Plight of the Goons: Before I start
0, I'm Sad: i dont really like opinionated reviews cause everyone has thier own tastes
0," Boooring!!!!: I decided to give up after 150 pages of this extremely boring book. If you are looking for fast moving suspense you're out of luck. Characters are engaged in pages upon pages of mindless conversation having nothing to do with the so-called ""suspense"" theme. On the other hand"
0, What the heck ???: I bought this superwinch atv mount for my polaris sportsman 500. It fit the atv just fine
1, The very best piano solos!!: This disc
0, Very Disappointed with this product: I had high expectations of this device but was disappointed by the poor documentation and cumbersome configuration. After investing the time and effort to configure the device I found its most unfortunate flaw. When powered off this device reverts to factory default configuration

1, turning thirty reviewed by minxemoo book review: OMG................This book is soooooo brilliant.It was as though I had stole my brothers diary and was reading it.Mike is an amazing Author. I am defiantly going to read more of his books.The characters he uses are like so many people I know.This is a must read for any male or female of any age.I don't want to write anything about the story line as I don't want to spoil it
1, Eclectic Poco: Though a tad uneven at times
0, Was a great blog
1, Excellent Perspective from a Non-Ordinary Iraqi: An excellent non-strident expression of perspective from a pair of creative and perceptive non-western eyes. In fact
0," 4.5 STARS? REALLY???: I GUESS IF YOU ARE A FILM STUDENT/FAN OF ADAM WEST/HOT FOR TOBEY MAGUIRE/AMY HATHAWAY/HAVE SEEN EVERY OTHER MOVIE OUT THERE/ETC/ETC/ETC...THEN JUST MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE ANY MORE THAN 3 STARS. I DON'T THINK THE MOVIE WAS BAD - THERE WAS 20 MIN OR SO OF MILDLY ENTERTAINING CLIPS ALTOGETHER - BUT THE WAY SOME OF YOU (REVIEWERS) MAKE SOME OF THESE MEDIOCRE FILMS SEEM LIKE THIS ""INTERESTING JOURNEY THROUGH THE EARLY CAREER OR SO AND SO"
1, Look Great!: I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!!! Its stylish yet great for the gym!!!! Going to buy him more!
0, Sized big: Sized a little too big for me other than that I guess I need to grow into itWhich can be used to motivate

1, Extremely Insightful: Since I have a background in Hindu philosophy
1, Clear direction for being with God: What a deeply enriching book! I have had to read it a few pages at a time to savor and feel my way through what is being said. I reccommend this book to any spiritual seeker
1, Great speaker for a great price: You cant go wrong with these speakers. The price and the sound are great. Easy to install. Maybe a little fragile.
1, Awesome Sound: These were easy to install (the grill could have been a little easier to attach) and awesome sound! The house really shakes now!
0, Don't bother: Save your money. This book(?)is a random collection of thoughts and recollections of a youth that no longer exists. Someone should have told the author that sometimes the world changes and not always for the better.
0, Lame: Well.. his friend and his wife gave it a good review. It must be good.$20 for a paperback by a nobody? You gotta be out of your mind. From the description it sounds pretty lame.
0, I can't rate the item because I never received my book from the jerks as ZP Books
1, Pretty good CD: NINO BOMBA & MR. P-MOSH are by far the best songs in this CD The rest is a very good creation of music combining jazz & other styles of rhythms.
0, Earthforce: This is one of the few books that I couldn't finish. It was long and drawn out. If you like boring over worded books
1, Rare Movie Where Art Imitates Life!: i saw this movie 10 years ago and was astounded to see a period of my life on screen. complete with best friend who succumbs to social norm. this is a beuatiful movie from start to finish
1, Oh my gosh! See this...!: I thought for a long time that Latter Days was my most favorite movie until I saw Maurice for the very first time
1, Simply Beautiful: What a lovely & well made movie. I never would have thought a scene of a chaste 2 seconds first hug between Hugh Grant & James Wilby could be so hot! All of the actors did a great job of conveying the deep
1, Vengance is Mine...: If you like revenge
1, gingerAZ: Bronson's character plans to live anonymously but when he finds his fiance was a victim of a protection racket one by one the criminals are hunted down in the style of Bronson's character.
0, Yogapilates: Video was really cheesy and only had one sequence that was mildly challenging for someone of intermediate skill.
1, Thank you: I love this series. I was very disappointed when it did not continue after the third season. This is great
0, Performance is good but I hate video touch.: I chose this DVD based on the name of the quartet. The performance was good to excellent
1, Masterful Work: A World Lit Only by Fire
1, Separation Between Church and State!!!: If you want to know the real horrors of a theocracy
0, Ignorance
1, Well Written. An enjoyable read.: The book was very enjoyable. The info gleaned about the Catholic Church and how it's corruption eventually led to the creation of Protestantism (thru Luther) was an eye opener.A lot of the facts stated in the book
1, Goetterdaemerung for a Great Biographer: I was initially angry at the prospect of reading this little work -- written in Manchester's seventieth year -- rather than a third and concluding volume of his monumental Churchill biography. Alas
0, Waste of Time: This book is boring. Not one part was even the least bit interesting. It seemed like everything was just thrown in there and the author didn't care what order anything was in. Just as long as it was written about. To me
1, Great book
0, pop history: Unfortunately
0, I was bored: I had to buy this book for a summer assignment my sophomore year of high school
0, Interest Quotient doesn't make up for Flaws: Manchester is a good writer. I'll grudgingly give him that. However
0, Ridiculous: Outlandishly silly
0, An airport novel masquarading as history: There are plenty of trashy historical novels to keep us entertained in planes and this might be a good example (although I read it on a coach) except that it is claiming to be factual. Well
0, But it's wrong! Wrong
1, As You Wish: Manchester has obviously infuriated 'history buffs
0, Anti-Catholic diatribe: Not much to say here. Manchester's not a professional historian
1, One of the BEST!!: As Regency romances go
0," Boring: The first reviewer got it right -- this is an artless and boring book. It totally fails to capture the excitement of the time it's purported to cover -- and contains a great many inaccuracies. The first ""half"" (I think it's actually less than half) of the book consists of entries from the author's own journal"
1, Excellent wrenches: The Allen wrenches are well made and come in an excellent assortment of sizes. The balldriver tip and long shaft make these wrenches particularly suited for hard-to-reach areas.I have not used the Torx wrenches
1, walk through fire for this!: A very strong release - a fan must have. Great production....all the songs are great and there is much variety in mood and content. She sounds awesome as always. Plus it's a bargain - you can't lose!
1, Think you make mistake: the shoe offered w/the color white/blue/red is the asics gel-tiger paw
0, The Biggest Disappointment: With pictures all over the CD I was led to believe that at least minimal effort would have gone into including at least some of the illustrations from Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks. Not one illustration is included on the CD let alone the complete works. :( While having the footnotes is potentially useful for scholars
0, A piece of junk: This book should have never been reprinted. The author has some pretty unique views on The Civil War
1, Fun reading: Have been enjoying the series since first introduced. Will continue reading new 'Pitt' novels as they come out.Anne Perry does another series 'Monk'
1, Shania You Impress Me Much! criticized by a devoted fan!: I was one of the many lucky San Diegans who Rocked This Country at Shania's 5/7/99 concert. Wow! This video was almost as breathtaking as the concert but of course
1, she's great love to see her sing and watch her videos: I saw Shania in concert in B'ham Al she was great wish I could see her again I have all three cd's behind the music tape
0," Shania ""Live"" is Disappointing: Being used to the superior sound quality of DVD's"
1, A Gripping Book: This is a book that never lets you put it down. A rivetting narration of a family saga. Ghosh's style of narration
1, The book is sensitive and touching.It is unpretentious.: Illa's character is difficult to understand.for a girl with so much exposure how come she was singularly lacking in ambition.Herlove for nick and her subsequent marriage tohim is so tragic because it is one-sided.Ironically all the Indian characters suffer from unrequited love
1, Gooby: cute movie for kids - heart warming - no violence or bad language - good DVD to add to the family collections
0, completely dumb: horrible movie. the only good thing about movie is the dad from american pie plays the elementary school teacher. i was tempted to actually buy this
1, The best collection of lullabies ever recorded: Having just put my fussy 15 month old to sleep with this tape (note: it's really not a book on cassette - it's all music)
1," A Few Great songs: Okay so in general this CD is not as good as Another Night. But really few CDs are. ""One More Time"" is perhaps my favorite techno song ever: its great for excercising"
0, Is this supposed to be scary?: Always be wary of films which claim to be better than some box-office hit or other.This cash-in on Jurassic Park bears no resemblance in the slightest to Harry Adam Knight's brilliant novel Carnosaur. So why bother getting copyright in the first place?The ideas behind this film are vaguely interesting and there is some good scenery
1, GREAT MOVIE MAKING.: The film is maube the best movie ever but the DVD set doesn't offer too much. I would have liked there to be more than the special. Maybe another interview with Welles.
0, Citizen Kane makes all the movies look good.: When a bad movie is in the top list
0, A classic
0, The best film EVER?! Oh
1, Amazon Prime Citizen Kane 70th Anniversary: Probably the greatest movie ever made. Watch movies on Amazon Prime and love it. But with this movie (and others) the disappointment comes when you realize you can not see any of the features without actually buying the movie. Not just buying the download.... You have to buy the actual disc to see the special features. Netflix
1, The image is as sharp as the dialogue: I'm not a big fan of blu-ray. I don't get excited by CGI. But to see Citizen Kane in glorious black and white
0, Unargubly the WORST movie of all time!: Citizen Kane is absolutely excrutiating from start to finish. Obviously what they forgot to put in this film is 'ENTERTAINMENT'.
0, Five Star Movie
0, Disappointed!: I was extremely disappointed. Amazon sent me a DVD that is supposed to be used in another country. It would not even work in my DVD player so I don't know if the movie was any good or not. They made a big mistake at my expense.
0, This moview was horrible. Buy Cops and Robbersons instead.: This movie was trash. The writing was a joke
0, Boring
0, Important For Its Time
0, Is everyone else mad !! The Film never starts: Ok for its' time it might have been good because it did things never done before. I went in expecting the film to be brilliant
0, It's getting worse everytime you see.: It would be difficult to find a movie more boring than this. THIS MOVIE IS MADE TO BORE YOU. I really don't know anything good to say about Citizen Kane except the fact that it is so bad that all the commentaries in the dvd and good reviews from famous critics can't even save this terrible film.
0, it stunk: I have had the displeasure of seeing this movie twice. It had no story
1, Buyer Beware: Five stars for the movie. However
0, Watch City Lights instead: Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time. How it garnered that reputation is far beyond me. This film is often prided on its technical innovations. The lighting
0, Citizen Kane is a very poor movie
0, I just got this DVD for Christmas. What a terrible film!: After seeing it for the first time
0, Get a Grip people: What is everyone's morbid fascination with this movie? I found it to be very boring and worthless. The acting is not good and the story is dull. I understand that Welles broke new ground with technology during the filming. So What? If it was not done by him it would of been done by someone. I give this movie zero stars and just to warn people not to waste their money on this flop.
0, An overrated and boring film.: In spite of all the hype that has been generated for this movie
0, The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time: In college
0, Uh-oh
1, Excellent Blu-Ray...: ...the film will last forever
1, Classic film done justice on blu-ray.: Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films ever made. It belongs in any film fan's collection. You probably already know that. The blu-ray looks amazing and sounds very good considering the film's age. The extras are informative and entertaining
1, A Good Remedial Guide: Japanese for Professionals has proved to be an ideal book for me. I have 4 years of formal Japanese study and lived in Japan for 2 years. However
1, After 7 years of abuse
0, Cheap plastic
0, Devolution: I believe I've bought 4 of this (or very similar) model of watch over the last five yars and been more than satisfied. It's a simple
1," The fluff that dreams are made of.: If you read my recent review of ""The Devil in Amber"
0, Somebody get Bibio some proper equipment: Bibio's guitar playing is adequate
0, Horrible: Doherty lost me completely at page 8 when he states that Phillip II is the one who moved the capital of Macedon to Pella from Aigai
0, Brightness: It's not a bright as I thought it should be
1, Scary! But the book came before the movie....: THis is an excellent book that will scare you! I am about 15 and reading this book made my sleep w/ my lights on for the first time in 10 years
1, Very Scary: one of the most scariest books ever written. About a possesed girl named regan. The sick twisted things that that demond makes here do. Such as stab herself with a cross. Until the mother takes this case out of her hands and into two preists to perform an exorcism on her. It all ends in a blood bath. By Mark Kermode comes the most scariest book ever
0," What!: The CD Title is ""Back to the Charleston"". I t dosen't even have the charleston on the free listening! This is an OUTRAGE! I give this CD a 1. Even though I like the charleston."
0, Magritte video - not suitable for school viewing: I ordered this DVD to supplement my surrealism project I teach to my art students. Good thing I watched it first! Magritte has SO many cool works of art....and yet the focus in this movie seems to be on his nude paintings. Several times the camera even zooms in for a closeup of the breasts!! I'm not a prude by any means
1, GREAT MOVIE!!: LORENZO LLAMAS STARS AS VIGILANT EX-MARINE SEEKING SEEKING REVENGE ON THOSE WHO MURDERED HIS FAMILY.IT'S A GREAT MOVIE!!
0, Have Not Received Yet.: I cannot appropriately rate this game
1, Great game!: I've just finished with the second chapter and I can already tell you that it's awesome. This game has a great storyline and combat controls that are easy to master
1, Enjoyable fantasy/fairy tale: Although the Forests of Serre is not my favorite McKillip book
1, Best of the Best - A real martial arts story: Most of the martial arts movies that you see in theatres tend to have the same story line. This movie's storyline is unique because it is about relationships - between the sport of martial arts
0, Two thumbs down: One of the most ridiculous
1, An excellent late album from the Strawbs: If you ignore the fact that commercially this turned out to be the end of the road for the Strawbs
0, Stick a fork in 'em.: At this point
0, It dented my laptop!: I just bought this laptop backpack so taht I could carry my powerbook along with books. I expected the laptop slot to be padded on the bottom
0, Not yoga: The instructor in this DVD rushes WAY to fast through the poses
1, Good Deal: The seller ran out of the item
1, Very Pleased: I purchased two boxes of nails and was afraid to get them all busted up
1, Well: I'm justing posting this to mess with the results. I like the couple of songs I downloaded off of Napster (especially Caroline Says part II
0, umm ... no: The late 90's was not a golden period for rock music. It was a time when critics & fans contorted themselves into agonising positions where mediocre neu-psychedelic bands like Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips started to sound good.Hopefully the arrival of some inspired new bands in 2001 - the Strokes
1, Strange and excellent work: If Brian Wilson and John Lennon had co-written a record and allowed Tom Waits to produce it
1," stunning & touching: ""deserter's song ""is a sucessful revolution & i love it far more than the previous albums of mercury rev.all the tracks are pieces of diamonds"
1, Whoopsy Daisys: I adore this movie; it's a great love story
1, Good movie.: I'm a huge Julia Roberts fan! However
1, In Lizzy's Opinion: I saw this movie on TV and wanted very much to add it to my collection. Immediately
0, No Chemistry and a Gag-Inducing Moment: I can't think of a movie where two stars had such little chemistry. Why Hugh wastes his time with the Julia Roberts character will remain a mystery throughout the whole movie. She continually reminds us that she just wants to be like every one else
0, Boring: I love british romantic comedy because I find them funnier than american ones. I love most american movies
0, Yuck: Personally I thought this was a boring film with phoned-in performances by both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts
0, the horror...the horror....: I saw this movie on a transcontinental flight and was ready to ask for a parachute about halfway through. How this ...
1, A breath of fresh romantic air: Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts prove in Notting Hill that a movie about love in the '90's can be tender and poignant without graphic sex and profane language. I saw it several times and plan to buy it as soon as it is available. It is a movie you can watch with a date. The soundtrack
0, I want two hours of my life back!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I would have walked out of the movie house
0, Lame: I'm opting to join the rank of the two star-ers (new word). I can't go down to one because technically (as in the use of technology) the movie is sound. Pity they didn't add some acting. Basic boy meets girl
1, A concise comprehensive review of Bonhoeffer and his beliefs: I am beginnig a series of lesson s on Bonhoeffer and found this volume to be invaluable as a course material.
1, New 80's: It is like updated 80's music
1, Atom is the funniest person alive: Atom and his package is aboslutely amazing. The reviewer who gave this cd one star knows nothing when it comes to music. These cd's are really really good
1, Fits narrow wrists: Bought this for my 10 year old daughter at Christmas this year. We have had a hard time finding a 'big kid' watch that fits her very narrow wrist...this fits and lets her tell time on her more mature sport watch. Great buy!
0, Poor audio quality: I am very disappointed in the audio quality of this CD -- without depth that I was looking forward to hearing... sounds like a cheap re-record!
1, Sublime in its prime-LIVE: This live Cd shows Sublime in their true glory. All of the songs were no doubt played at a party where everyone was having a good time
1," AWESOME CD!: Brad nowell was the Jimi Hendrix of the 90's! He really could play that guitar! Especially on tracks like ""Date R**e"""
1, Awesome: Even if this CD doesn't have the best setlist they could have put together it does accomplish the most important thing it needed to do: capture the feeling of live Sublime. From the openning explosion of Don't Push to the melodic ending of Ruca and everything in between this album captures the atmosphere and feeling of being at a Sublime concert. For anyone who started liking Sublime when they heard the self-titled album and obviously never got a chance to see Sublime live this album will keep you hooked for life. Also if all you have is the self-titled and are looking for more
0, Intriguing device
1, Something new for North Americans.: Ever wonder if it were possible to bottle magic and sell it what would people do? Probably ignore it and pay attention to somethingcommon
1, Beautiful: Good book
1, sleek
1, Just enjoy: Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business
1, Fit nicely: I used the fitting guide and a measuring tape to get the right size. I like to wear them to school clinicals. They're also great on days I sit a lot.
1, Her best: Iris Murdoch started her career with one brilliantly funny novel
1, My House In Umbria: This is a quintessential Maggie Smith movie which takes place in the beautiful Umbrian countryside. The story is tender and the movie is artful. A great way to spend a relaxing Saturday afternoon.
1, My House in Umbria: Another Italian travel film and seeing is believing
1, My House In Umbria: I love this movie! Saw it with at a friends home
1, Great dvd!!!: I was already working out 3 or more times a day
0, Very low finishing quality: When I open it
0, Good songs....but good album? debateable: She has some rockin songs on here. All her singles kickass and the last song on the album with M.I.A. (i friggin love her) is fire. but then
1, AWESOME: this cd is the ish. the intro was a lil pointless in the beginnin in my opinion. the cd has alot of hot tracks
0, Good writing
0, Save your money...: And buy white masking tape
1, Classic book on darkroom work: Excellent book on the basics of film development. Unfortunately
1, Up and Down album: I gave four stars for the following reasons:PROSDon't Do The Crime and Love Is All Is Alright are two of my favorite tracks the group have ever put forth. The production on DDTC is first rate (sad they didn't record at the same tempo as they do live
0, 0 stars for this one.: This is NOT an official release by Paul Oakenfold. These guys are doing it without his consent and trying to profit from Paul Oakenfold's name. Hence they came out with a DVD of this too. Shame on you. Boycott it. Don't participate in it.
0," Not Good: Oakenfold has always thrived on house and deep trance and everything in between. The appropriate title of this album should be ""Voyage Into Goa"" because that's precisely what this cd is. I don't know why he released this cd. He never plays goa live"
1, Melville From the Hip: This edition of Melville's ISRAEL POTTER is one of the most accurate will will have in terms of text and also a good introduction to the lighthearted side of Herman Melville. His satirical portraits of Great Americans and their various hypocrises are central to the book
1, Gorgeous Voice: Sissel has the extraordinary vocal talent that can encompass both opera and adult contemporary pop. Her voice soars and captures every note with grace and beauty leaving the listerner with a haunting melody. Every note is left with a lyrical quality that is stunning. For fans of Sarah Brightman this a must have. There is simply something for every music affecianado on this cd.
1, Excellent: A great series. Should have never been cancelled! Ray Romano is excellent in it (as are all of the actors). The performances are very nuanced and non-affected. The cinematography is great on every episode. I hope that the creators (Ray Romano and Mike Royce) come up with another great series like this. I did catch Romano on Parenthood this season and while he was very good in this
1, Brilliant!: As I suspected-actually I knew it was going to be GREAT from watching the final season.Such great acting
0, Raunchy - and that's being polite.: I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. I bought it as a gift for an associate that was moving to Rome. Unfortunately
0, Crippled by Lack of Graphics: The author appears knowledgable about his subject matter
0, Poor choice for a cheap telephoto: I was a little naive in the purchasing of this lens. I went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300mm. They all said the same thing- there is no such thing
0, Dont waste your money!: I don't even think this lens deserves 1 star! It is junk. Not Sharp
0, avoid this thermos: Avoid this thermos only keeps coffee warm about 2 hours 
0, not 2 decks: This unit does not hold two decks on one side but it does hold two decks if you put them into both sides. Not the way one would use it.
1, Works well: I read the previous reviews and found this product to be reliable for the purpose of playing canasta. It stays steady and performs as expected.
1, 2 deck rotating card tray: Product is excellent
1, Great Tea: This is a great tea and you can even sprinkle in a little hot chocoate & cool whip and it is even better yet!
1," Really loud white-boy blues!: Not only do you disclose your age when confessing to liking ""Tightly Knit"
1, A rare first hand account: Accepting that such old books (accompanied by countless explanatory footnotes) are never a really easy read
0, Missing Part!!: The adapter is useless without a converter to plug it into the cooler. The cooler works fine in the car
0, not good quality: I do not like this brand. I don't think my body absorb whatever nutrients supposed to contain in the vitamin pills.
1, Very fast shipping: I am using this product because it's the only prenatal that doesn't upset my stomach.Very gentle
1, Only thing negative I can say is..: The pills are very large! If you have a hard time swallowing pills
0, Great product
0, surely it can taste better than this ...: My insurance does not cover prenatal vitamins
1, My all-time favorite vitamins - and no gluten!: I've been using the Prenatal One and Women's OneRainbow Light Womens One
0, Causes horrible stomach pains and constipation: I had to stop taking these vitamins because I would run to the bathroom in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains. It also caused pretty bad constipation. It may the level or form of iron but I had to switch because I could not tolerate them. I tried splitting the pill and taking it twice a day but I was still miserable. I switched to New Chapter Prenatal Vitamins and they are far better. I have more energy and no digestive issues with the New Chapter brand.
0, Too Big: These are horse tablets
0, don't buy it
1, Interesting
1," Awesome Book.: I just finished reading this book and I would have given it 5 stars but I felt that the series was entirely too short. I think the ""ghost writer"" is doing a wonderful job. I wish that there was one more for this series. I have read all V.C. Andrews book and I found that the writer is just growing with the times."
1, An Absolute Moust Have for any fu-flick fan: This was a very good movie that displays some very good choreographed fights and comedy.plenty of styles
1, Great patterns for men!: This book has great patterns for men to be knit by anyone although the book is written for men to learn to knit. Good instructions
0, Sorry I purchased it :(: I'm sorry to say
0, No thanks: I've had this phone for an extremely unfortunate 6 months. The other day
1," WHERE'S THE KINDLE EBOOK?: When will ""The Greatest Story Ever Told "" be released on Kindle ebook? It is available on the nook but the scanning is atrocious. There are many words not spelled correctly. Come on Amazon .This is a book easly understood by people of all ages. It brings the bible to life"
1, Gritty and great: I love this single
0, Definitely not worth it.: First off
0, Bootlegged Copy: (Reviewing a marketplace purchase)I received a DVD-R that contained the advertised content
0, If you loved the book
0, Terrible Film!: I couldn't get past the first five minutes before I shut it off. Being a mother
1, chilling but compelling: Lavish
0, Slow
0, Smells Like It's Gone Bad: I didn't read the book. But if it's as ridiculous as the movie
0," NOT surprising...: that in this day and age that when someone in hollywood hears of a novel deemed 'unfilmable' that the sound of a cashbox would deafen to a whisper the truly telling phrase "" and there's a good reason""...""Lord of the Rings""???? YES! I DO BELIEVE there is documentation SOMEWHERE than upon the published release of THAT famed trilogy"
0, Gets pretty weird at the end there...: I was sort of into this film at first. It had an interesting premise and I love Alan Rickman so I really wanted to see this. I had read that some people really dug it and some couldn't stand it. Well
0, Okay movie: I was expecting this movie to be different than most & I was right! It was pretty slow moving but not a bad movie if you are looking to kill some time.
0, Unwatchable: This was a thoroughly unpleasant movie. Odor is it's driving theme & I found this film to be odorous. I can not possibly recommend this unwatchable film to anyone.
0, Please for the love of god do NOT waste your time: I love anime and the Count of Monte Cristo
0, Do not buy this...........! Jult Warfell: I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. What waste for dub talented actors. Jult Warfell
0, Received Koolatron in 1 DAY BUT WITHOUT AUTO / D/C PLUG!!!!: I am greatly upset
1, great product: Works just like it said it would. other reviews helped me choose this over a different one. Thanks
0, Doesn't cool quickly and doesn't sit steadily in the trunk: I bought this cooler specifically to cool beverages while driving. Not only did it keep sliding around and falling over
1," DAMN!!!!!!!: ""dirty south""!!!!!! this is the album of the year!!!!!!! i got this s' when it first came out"
1, DID IT AGAIN!: If I could I would frame this CD on my wall. But then I wouldnt be able to hear the greatest CD of all time. This joint is a step above the rest of them commercial artist like Jigga
1," IF YOU LIKE THIS YOU WILL LOVE ATLIENS!!!: Props to this album. Top honors for hottest tracks go to both versions of ""Da' Art of Storytellin"""
1, Great Service: Product was in excellent condition just like the seller said and I received the item in a timely fashion.
0, I do not recommend this item: I do not recomend this item as it is not endorsed by the people who have the Pink Warrior trademark.
0, Not what I'd call low-carb: These recipies do sound delicious
0, dont try to plug it in at home: product arrives with no plug-in cord. is it just me? shouldn't one be included?
0, Very disappointing!: The fridge arrived today and I am sending it back tomorrow - I was so disappointed to open the box and find that the door hinges had gotten completely busted up during shipping! There was absolutely *no* packaging material
1, Good Film: This is an adorable romantic comedy starring the ever classy Doris Day and handsome Rock Hudson. I don't quite understand the concept these two people sharing a party-line-but maybe that's just a generation thing. Randall is also funny
1, My Mothers Favorite Movie: This was a great movie and a perfect sample of the type of movies that were put out in that era (1960ish). Nothing heavy or earth shattering
1, You lied...and you'll be sorry!: My first blueray purchase. Doris and Rock
0, Hitachi 310881 Slide Fence: Cheap plastic more appropriate for a child's toy. Floppy isn't helpful on a power tool.Broke the second time it was used. Don't bother with this one.
1, A one of it's kind handbook on how to say yes
1, Boy
0, Are you kidding?: I think i must restate my previous review- how long have you been listening to metal? (and paying attention to song structures?)
0, No good: How can you listen to this stuff. the sing just growls that's it. everybody can growl. How can you listen to this stuff.
1," ""...Burned Spy Continued!"": ...Michael gets into it again when he has to do a job for his new handler and accidentally burns another spy named Jesse. Well Michael and the gang take Jesse into the fold to help him find out who burned him (Jesse)"
1, A great book: By a friend's recommendation
1," This redhead's voice is RED-HOT!: I saw Allison's video for ""Set you Free"" on CMT and had to buy the album. I was very impressed. Throughout the whole CD I thought to myself how much she sounded like Shelby Lynne"
1," A Great Musical!: My gal and I spent a great evening watching this movie.We sang along and laughed and danced around the living room.What else do you want with a muscial?And who would have thought Kevin Spacey was such a great song and dance man.To those that critize this movie as not being ""accurate"""
1, Spacey Is Outstanding: My wife and I loved this movie as well as the CD. Kevin Spacey has captured a time and music era that is timeless.
0, enjoyable: The movie was enjoyable. However
0, not an easy listen: I am a fairly big bjork fan
1, Bjork Rules That's Tops: After listening to Bjorks latest album
0, High concept
1, The pleasure is all ours.: Despite being a Bjork fan for many years
0, Abstract and bloody: The album can best be described as a disturbing abstract painting. It looks good in the museum
0, Avante Garde= Avn'te Got A Clue: Pretentious/ambitious art does not always equal great art. There are some great moments in this album like Triumph of a Heart
0, Real Rating: 5 shovels (full of Bullsh*t): Thank you
0, Is she on crack?: Honey
0, Its not her voice..its the electronica stuff that we love!: All these bandwagon type loyal fans putting in their hopeful 2 cents. It just makes me ill. Ive heard this album at the record store
0, Eccentric indulgance: This vocal-driven experiment falls flat with little songwriting substance to back up all the choral gimmickry. A few interesting textural properties are to be found throughout
1, Bjork knows what she is doing: I think it's ridiculous how some people listen to this album and suddenly decides that Bjork is 'crazy' or 'on crack'. If you've been following her albums and career
1, Bjork's biggest fan (overused title
1," Give me a break: Bjork has the right idea. ""There's definetly no logic in human behavior."" After reading reviews for Medulla and seeing some of the negative comments"
1, For the die-hard Bjork fan.....: Ok
1," Björk at the heart of human nature: The lush orchestration and electronic experimentation that typify much of Björk's work have been abandoned in an ambitious undertaking; a record almost entirely comprising layers of vocal sampling and manipulation. On ""Medulla"" - by definition"
1, Rats trained themselves with this: I have 3 rats. One female and 2 neutered males. I bought a litter pan for them and had been trying out different materials in it to get them to stop pooping everywhere. Nothing was working until I got this litter. I added it and tossed in a few of their little poops and within ten minutes they had used it. By the end of the first day they had all used it.They now use it for poop about 75% of the time
1, Really love this litter: I was a skeptic
0, extremely helpful book attached to strings of Capitolism: The Cliff Notes Company believes that it is above hundreds of other companies by thinking that its product should not be published online whatsoever. and those that do are threatened with lawsuits for copyright infringement. Many websites have been shut down becuase of their 'superiority' over hundreds of other publishing companies whos own material is eveready at the click of a button. Sites such as these are public services for those who do not have the time or money to buy the book and cliff notes themselves. These people are just trying to educate themselves with a better understanding of a book. But now it seems that the whole idea behind the internet ( free knowledge ) is being slowly killed by companies claiming rights to everything to make the next dollar. It's not called the Information SuperHighway for nothing you know.- N.N.N.

0," Save your money....Don't beleive the hype: I have kept hearing about how great this disc is and how great this ""ripper"" is. Well"
0," Detuned guitars are different but the vocals?: The priest w/ Ripper Owens isnt anyhting good at all. listen to these tracks and you'll wish Rob was back. Ripper isnt bad but he isnt half the singer Rob is. Compare the studio ""Painkiller""version with the live one heard on this album and its a total failure. He cant hit the high notes or even mid-notes and has the crowd sing most of the song. as with the rest of the album it grooves but the drummer sounds almost as bad as ripper and he's younger than any of them!! buy other live albums WITH the orginial and better singer on vocals and notice the huge difference in performance"
0, bad advice???????: another waste of time. dont buy this book unless you are totally new to real estate.I dont return books as a practice but i am returning both books by this authur.I am a professional invester there are good books these are not them.

0, Halo 2 was a big let down... I hated it.: Halo 2 is the most overrated game of all time. Ghost Recon 2 blows it out of the water. I returned Halo 2 after a couple of nights. It offers NOTHING new for a 1st person shooter.I have no clue why so many people like it so much. The online play was weak as well.Get Ghost Recon 2
0, HALO SUCKS: THE HALO SERIES IS THE MOST OVERRATED GAME FRANCHISE EVER!!!! I HAVE NEVER PLAYED A MORE FRUSTRATING GAME! (EXEPT HALF-LIFE 2) HALO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0," halo 2 guns???: This game will not go down as the best game in history probadly most over ratedIts the same as the first one!!! (microsoft must be laughing as the money rolls in)it dose deserver more than one star but not much. I really did try to enjoy it but sadly it was sooo badUr team mates sayings r sooo lame i wanted to kill them to shut them up. The game is the same all the way through. A big battle. Then u run around in pitch black tunnels. This game is way to dark it hurt my eyes and that is just bad. Its to hard to see whats goin on in 4 player and 1 player they put to much effort on graphics and u can't see anything.The last straw was when a team mate ran up t me and said ""follow me"" the he ran to an entrance to yet another dark tunnel and stood there????? that is just bad. Come on i played 100 bucks for this and it was trash :(BUY THE FIRST ONE MUCH BETTER WORTH 3 stars."
1, Not since Quake 2...: Not since Quake 2 has a science fiction shooter sucked me in. Halo 2 is the best in the series.
1, Pretty much the best game you've ever played: I really enjoyed this game; it's probably the best first-person shooter ever. The marketing and hype were a little over the top
1, AWESOME IDEA!!!!: Microsoft came out with a brillent game. This is WAAAAAAYYYYYYYY better then Halo. Halo 2 is More realistic!! The viecheals when you shoot them they get dameged. Please BUY this game. On some levels you get to be the covent COOL EH?!! Much harder then Halo. Halo 2 is the leader!!! I GIVE THIS GAME 100+ STARS!
0," this game stinks!!!!!!!!: What is wrong with this game! people are all ""it is cool"" but really it stinks. I mean what is so ""fun"" about going around and killing things.i hear my friends say ""the blood is blue"" that is just sick this M rated game turned my friends into jerks because they got all violent. I went to my friends B-day party and thay played this all night! idid not even pick up the controller! I wanted to go home! so dont mess up your brain!"
0, Halo Sucks: Halo 2 is even worse than Halo 1. Halo 2 is more unrealistic than the first. The vehicles are mainly the same and the guns are a little different. If you didnt like the firt Halo dont buy this because it is even stupider. They should have changed the name because it sounds like a game for girls. The grafics havent gotten better. If you like realistic shooting games get Conflict Veitnam. It is very realistic and theres 14 missions and over 40 weapons.
1, One of the best Halo games: I really enjoy playing this. I really only purchased this game for the campaign mode so I could see what mainly happened between Combat Evolved and Halo 3. Halo 2 was a major step forward for the franchise
1, Great game!: Well
0, Educational.... but mean: 4 one thing ithink this game is bad and boring. I bought it thinking it would be good like aminal crosing or pokeman
1, The BEST GAME EVER MADE..
1, Halo 2: Three words: Amazing
1, great but not without flaws: i am not a gamer but found the first halo to be above and beyond anything i had previously seen. i had my order in for halo 2 when it was due out in april.the game is a marvel. the graphics are better than anything i have seen and the controls are much smoother and easier to handle than the grand theft games. the addition of the double wielding guns is an advance but takes a significant amount of getting used too. i do have a problem seeing the surroundings while carrying both guns which is a nuisance and has caused me many deaths from unseen sources. though it is early for me in the game
0, One big commercial: This game sucked! I am probably the only one who feels this way. If you like playing the original Halo
1, great game: This game came just as described and in and came whe it said it would
0, Halo 2 sucks: Halo 2 has no realistic wepons and come on fighting creatures that dont exist. this is complete rubbish and is easy to get board of and the makers sell it for 50 bucks. It is not even worth 50 cents. it is worthles and is a comlete waist of money.
0, Fun but pointless: the only thing worth playing this fun but pointless game is multplayer and online. other than that this game is terrible. i wasted $40 on this. i should have bought a barbie game. it is just that terrible.p.s. i never played this game
1, A really positive experience
1, In Freedom's Cause: an inspiring read: This book is one of the greatest I have ever read.Taking place in medieval Scotland

0, This DVD wins the Cynical Rip-Off Awards hands down!: Zodiac lovers beware! This bare-bones release (not bad in itself
0," By far their worst album: I have to start off by saying that I'm a *huge* Heep fan; I have pretty much everything they've done from 1970 to the present (and I think the current line-up is the best since the ""Demons and Wizards"" era). That said"
1, The Lost Heep album: Equator is the long lost Heep album. This particular line up rather quit after its limited release. Basically the band was not gettin much attention
1, Atmospheric: It's in an alternate past/present/future where vampires run the church and care for mankind. That's as believable as a lot of religious dogma. Kind of slow
0, Don
0, Uh
1, Avant-Garde Art Explained: This book
0, disorganized mess: While the author has a huge amount of knowledge on the subject matter he clearly has no idea how to create a textbook that flow seemlessly from one topic to the next. I spent all semester jumping back and forth between subjects and topics. The case studies are dull and dry

0, Vornado AQS 15 replacement hepa filter: While I like the Vornado Air Purifier
1, Works well: It does work and keeps the air fresh - I didn't change mine for literally years (I would take it out and hand clean it periodically which I don't think hurts anything
1, RV brake controller: I purchased a new suv to tow my camper and when I called the dealer
1, Powerful: Bob has been my favorite male vocalist for along time now. This album makes him even more on the very top of the list. Soulful
0, Don't be fooled by the picture and discription!: Even though there are two pictured and the description says transmitter/receiver his comes with only one unit. You will need two to operate.

1, Jackie Chan the master: Great action and comedy mixed together in this classic Jackie Chan movie!5 star rating
1, Bright Shadow- The best book you will ever read!: The Book Bright Shadow by Avi is an imaginative and adventerous Fantasy book. Morwenna is a servent girl for King Ruthvin. when she is at work dusting things
1, Awesome chew toy: Bought this toy as a gift for my sister's westie. Her dog often chooses this chew bone over raw hides and pig ears. Great product.
0, dog bone: Not for a dog that chews...which is all of them. But especially aggressive chewers like my 10 month old terrier. Big chunks come off and get swallowed. That can't be good for them. Steer away from these.
0, Potentially dangerous: The instructions manual says that pieces no bigger than a grain of rice should break off. However
1, Great workout earphones: Great workout earphones
0, Weak bass equals weak sound: Since I workout and do cardio six days/week
0, Fell apart almost instantly: These ear buds are super crappy and fell apart as soon as they were out of the package. The silver part comes off the housing quite easily
0, Not so great - waste of money: I bought these headphones for my husband who works out and runs every day. They were uncomfortable and the sound quality was not very good. Didn't take long for the sound to go out in one of the earphones.
0, Great Headphones... Horrible Wires: Do not buy this product. As good as the sound
0, Didn't work at all.: I'm still not sure entirely how these are supposed to work
0, Good sound
0, Poor fit: I gave these a try because of the innovation with twist-to-fit
0, Probably better for larger ears.: These didn't fit my ears well and the sound quality is nothing to write home about. I run so I like to have loud music with substantial bass to push me along.
1, Great for working out: The sound quality is good but you can't beat a pair of headphones designed to not fall out during a jog. I do a decent amount of trail running and had always struggled to find good headphones in the past. These are great for working out!
0, Good for work out: I bought this because I want a pair for work out.Later I found out it is really not comfortable to wear it since the little thing keeps stretching my ears.The soound quality is soso. I did compared it with my ipod ear buds. I found out that this pair has even worse performance comparing to those ipod ear phones.
0, Sennheiser MX 55 earphones: The quality of the product is fine but the padding around the earbuds and the supporting padding areas are the worst. I lose the padding on a consistent basis. The casing is an exercise of design over function. In order to put the ear phones back in the case
1, good product some complaints: comfortable fit seem to stay in Good sound quality for price2 complaints: takes a little time to untwist them to use and I get shocks when I put them in if wearing fleece (in cold weather)!
0, Unhappy with purchase: Bought these head phones for running. One month later the left side no longer works after using them only a few times. The cord entangles itself after every use no matter how carefully you put it away. The ear cups are very difficult to seat correctly when changed and as a result I lost one of the sponge cups after changing it even though I took great care to seat it correctly. Despite the various cups to size the phones correctly I never found a good combination to make them secure while running thus they were either falling out or uncomfortable. I am currently looking into getting my money back.
1, Decent earbuds: These have pretty good sound
1, Good Product: I bought these earbuds because when I run
0, Too big: I got these ear buds because others that I have tried don't stay in. The problem with these however
0, Unusual design: I twisted and twisted
0," Don't confuse ""Twist-to-fit"" with ""One size fits all"": Maybe I have freakish ears or something"
0, torture your ears: I have purchased 7 or 8 different cheaper headphones to wear while running at the the gym. I have normal sized head and ears
0, twist to fit doesn't work: They work fine as regular headphones but the twist to fit system is a joke. It's stupid
0, Don't buy if your ears are on the small side: I have tried these at least 5 times and I'm done. My ears are smallish (not freakishly
1, Great for running: I have tried numerous sport headphones and always found them fine for the gym
1, Excellent headphones: As long as you have a normal ear this headphone won't fall off. Sound is like a 7 out of 10
0, Addons are easily lost: After the first day running one of my ear buds popped out of my ear and the little green disk went flying. The next day I went running (now using another set of green disks) I took off the ear buds after my work out the green ring surrounding the bud itself came off and summarily fell into a storm drain... Customizable but the parts easily come off and can be lost.
0," False advertising by Motorola--do not buy: 1) Product spec states it supports WPA encryption. I couldn't get it to work so I contacted Motorola tech support by email. The return email stated ""the printserver doesnot support WPA security. (sic)"" Thus"
1, They do the job: Not much to be said about this product. Just watch for a low price and then stock up!
0, Doesn't last very long.: I suppose it's doing its job
0," Smelly & Disgusting: Thinking I would save a few $$$ instead of buying directly from vorando - I ordered these and learned the lesson of ""you get what you pay for"". After running on my voranado humidifyer for just 1 hour (in COLORADO where it's dry) the musty and mildew smell that was emitted from these filters stay in the house for several more days. I ordered filters from voranado directly and didn't have the issue. Don't bother with these"

1, B-5 Rules.: Babylon 5 was an awesome television series and these movies were no exception. JMS has a exceptional mind that developed this series from start to finish that has serious philosophilcal implications
0, Rehash minus one: As it was pointed out by another reviewer
1, Great Trivia and Information: This is a great book for any Friends fan. Lots of background information since the beginning of the show. I hope they continue to update with even more info from the current season.
0, Rivets Bulge: The knife has good looks as far as styling but isn't very comfortable to grip because the rivets are not recessed. this is the only knife I have ever seen that is made like this. They actually bulge from the handle. They should have recessed the rivets.Also for a knive maker with a reputation for excellence the finish on the blade was rather crude with spots that can't be removed without abrasives which would ruin the looks.I am not happy with this knife.
1, high qual
0, Too Big and Annoying: Bought these for sporting purpose as i like to cycle and go to the gym weekly. Good sound but only stays in my ears for 30 seconds at a time. Cord is too short to have an IPOD in your pocket and the extension cord is too long to have in your pocket. I am not happy with them at all and i strongly recommend not to buy them
1," Makeready: Image Correction Bible: Dan Margulis' ""Makeready"" is an excellent resource for anyone who works with Photoshop in a prepress situation. It is written in very understable and often humorous terms. This book has made my job much"
0, This CD is of low quality: I believe that this CD is of low quality; Don't WASTE your money. Get another CD

1, zoltan tokos !: i am not a professional guitarist
1, A Legend: This album along with all of the others is fantastic. If you ever go to Boston your experience will not be the same without seeing him perform at the Cantab in Central Square in Cambridge on Friday or Saturday night. Find out why his fan club includes such greats as Paul Simon. This man is the real deal.
1, saucony jazz shoes: great shipping and great product! i love my shoes and they were exactly what i ordered at a great price.
1, accessible: this is shakespeare's most accessible comedy. it's a farce about mistaken identities among identical twins. nothing complicated here. the play has it's funny moments. it's not the bard's best comedy; that's 'much ado about nothing'
1, Must Read for Montessori Moms and Non-Montessori Moms Alike: I wish I'd read this before my child was born. Maria Montessori was so far ahead of her time it is astounding. There are no words to describe how timely and important for you to read this book. It has changed the way I see myself
1, A frightening picture painted clearly: I found this book an excellent insight into the power of the Christian Right and its hold on the American public. It is pleasing to someone who is prepared to present the facts and to not sensationalise an issue that has greater implications for the safety of the world than many people realise. Goldberg paints a frightening picture of the reach of the Christian Right and their desire to impose their will on not only America but the world in general. Goldberg accurately describes the role of fear and the need to find an enemy that is driving this group forward. This desire only succeeds in illuminating the fact theat these people are indeed the enemy.
0, WORST GUN EVER: I bought this gun thinking it was a good one. when it arrived i tried it and it seemed okay.after about 2 weeks the stock broke

1, goodasgold: The Stanco Non-stick oven liner is performing as advertised. Had to trim a little as I have a gas oven and shield must fit inside heat vents. Has not curled or buckled.
1, Attention all true gundam fans: I am a big fan of gundam and a really big fan of Kiyuki Tomino also known as Yoshiyuki Tomino. This book is true to all of the Gundam series and movies. This book gives an insight into the complete gundam saga from the one year war to Turn A Gundam. From the Universal Century time line to the alternate universe time lines you will be impressed with the detail poured into the reviews. The book includes information on the model kits on the series and tells the detail and grade of the kits.I would say that any serious gundam fans should definately purchase this book. You will thouroughly appreciate it and enjoy every minute spent reading it.

1, Move over
0, This is so fake: If you are an exorcist fan and expect this to come close to it >>>>>> SAVE YOUR MONEY !Incredibly fake and boring. I don't watch many movies and regret the time spent watching this one.

1, Moviebuff: Out of all the film noir movies
1, The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer: Great book that I am using now. It is very beneficial to literature classes.
1, Can ANYONE help??: Hi everybody. Just wanted to say that we really enjoy this crib and have had no problems till now....and it's all our fault :(Our son is going to be 2 years old at the end of July and we need to covert his crib into a day bed....but like many other people
1, Solid Crib: I think this is a great crib which is very sturdy. The only thing I don't like about it is that your child can put teeth marks on it.
0, Several problems with this crib: Although it was very easy to assemble and reasonably priced
0, a serious book for serious people...: This is well meaning
1, Great resource on the Grail Lore: Ronan Coghlan has done a who's who on Grail Lore

0, History For Christians Who Don't Care Much For History: I got this book as part of a curriculum package for my second grader. I decided to pre-read it to see how it was
0, Dismal Disappointment: While I have enjoyed all the other Resident Evil flicks.. the first one especially... this one is so far over the top and out of plausible reality with techno tricks that destroy believability... that unfortunately... it just plain sucked!!!!!!!!
1, a very good read!!: If you like magic and good fighting evil this is a book to read! Very well written and good depth of characters.
1, Better than I had hoped for!: I bought this to connect a satellite receiver to a pc for recording shows. This cable is HUGE! It is super fat and heavy. The connectors are good and I couldn't believe how well it was made. I see similar cables at the stores for $80. I'm very glad I bought this cable. I have no quality issues at all. If I ever need another cable I will check these guys first. It was hard to find anything other than a cheapo Chinese 25 foot cable for $4. Anything else was usually Monster and started out around $80. This is a good deal.
0, disappointed...: I was so disappointed in this book. I really wanted to like this. But I could barely stand the main character/narrator
1, Great Read!: Having grown up in New England
0, Book condition: The book was listed as like new and it was not. It looked very used and since it was a gift

1, The Brothers Bulger cements Howie's reputation: I was skeptical at first

1, Delightfully unique!: I loved the story of Brer Rabbit and the Briar Patch when I was a kid. (I had the...(gulp)...album of the story...boy am I old!!) It's great to be able to share these stories with my kids. It's not perfect
1, No one does the right thing: This is a stone classic that explores the dynamic of race relations
1, One of the best of all time . . .: . . . and another Spike Lee project cheated by the Oscars. :-)Seriously though
1, The Uncle I Never Met: Robert Fulghum feels like family. This book cheers me up when I am blue... brings me back to earth when I am off in space. It makes me cry and laugh at the same time. I own several of his books and have many of the stories memorized. I never tire of reading the books. This particular book started my collection (as it started Mr. Fulghum's)... and is probably the most well-worn book I own.
0," Disappointment: The story line from the Series on TV was not continued with the 'way I had hoped?""Soalme's d. gets her two children by other men. having affairs just as her mother did. and when her father dies"

1," Inspiring ""La Campanella"": I found the DVD extremely inspiring in the way in which Kissin makes all of the pieces look so easy :) I agree with other critics in that so much more could have been of the documentary itself but the encores at the proms make up for the lack of detail / information in the earlier parts.The two particular pieces I most enjoyed were ""A Grand Waltz - Chopin"" (great introduction by him :) ) and ""La Campanella"" (the latter of which I will never play even if I had several lifetimes!)."
0, Mr Kissins playing is nothing but emty: I visited a concert with mr Kissin in Stockholm a few years ago. I could barely stay awake. I then realized that popularity has nothing to do with emotionall strenght or depth
1, Great book!: Simple drawings
1, Clifford's Animal Sounds: This is a board book about Clifford when he was little. It is such a nice little book for youngsters and I highly recommend it.
0, Defective unit: This unit showed up defective. Takes one 9V battery. Giving the gears a push
0, Don't Bother!: I bought this for my elderly mother who lives in assisted living because she and her friends have trouble shuflingcards. The first one I bought didn't work at all so I returned it and received a replacement. The replacement broke after just two days. This product is cheap and I would not bother purchasing it. I will say that Amazon made the returns and refund back to my account easy. That was the only positive.
0, Broken: One side of the card shuffler was broken so my granddaughter could not use it. There were no papers with the item when I received it
0, Bicycle Deck Shuffler: This item did not work. The momentary switch was defective and opperated intermittently at best. Unfortunately
0, You get what you pay for!: I ordered this for my mom since she has pseudo gout in both of her wrists. We only need two decks shuffled for a family game we play
0, Loud and bizarre: To start
1, Easy and Quick: I'm a member of a card club and since I bought the card shuffler it has made the games go a little faster. I bought the 1-2 card shuffler because it is smaller to take on a vacation.Love my shuffler.
0," Bad Choice- Even on a Scooter: I tried these with my MP3 player all the way up with a Boostaroo headphone amplifier and the volume on the speakers all the way up inside a closed full face HJC helmet- still couldn't hear much of anything. I was sitting still on my 500cc Aprilia Scooter- probably the quietest ""motorcycle"" out there. I'm far from deaf and my $10 Sony over the ear sporty buds are pristine under the same conditions- save your time and money and head to Walmart. I'm mailing them back tomorrow. (the Boostaroo does help with regular earphones/buds to get over the bike and wind noise.)"
1," Need more Jr. Walker: Motown used to have ""Shotgun"" and ""Roadrunner"" - two of Jr. Walker's best albums - available on a single disc. I wish they'd reissue that one. Still"
1, Want to Read More: Very good book. Nice sequel. Would liked to have learned more about Rand and his relationship to Maggie and Shea. Hope to read much more about Gregori! I highly recommend this book.
1, nice hose: Very nice air hose. I store all 100 ft of it on an electrical cord spool
1, For the kids: the movie arrived ahead of schedule
0, Wow
0, The Title Should Be: KING CAMP LIVES: Watching this film some 18 years later I wondered what were the filmmakers thinking? Was this to be taken serious? Gee
0, Why?: This movie picks up 10 years after the 1976 remake of King Kong. What i want to know is why they even bothered with this film. This film is not only boring and pointless it is filled with bad acting and some of the worst dialogue i've ever heard in a movie. Fans of the King Kong series try and stay away from horror of a movie
0, Kong is alive and finds a girlfriend.: This film is a direct sequel to the 1976 version ofKing Kongand you are treated to a quick 2 minutes of the condensed ending of that film starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange.It is now 10 years later. In Atlanta
0, I agree with redstrawberry: Anyone who has thyroid problems knows that this diet full of sodiumand unhealthy canned foods will not help you.
0, FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT: I purchased this product for the dual use. The DVD on this unit never worked and when i called the customer service they wanted me to send it back to them and were going to charge me $160 to replace it with the newer version. I asked what would they do if the DVD does not function in the new unit and they did not had an answer to that. This company does not stand by its product. DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT AT ANY COST!
1, GREAT Flatware: This is the best flatware that I have ever gotten---it is simple butelegant---and perfectly balanced. Perfect for everyday use---it just feels good when you use it.
0, Rusting knives: I registered for this item and decided against it after finding similar flatware at BBB. I had the same problem with rust on the knives with two other brands of flatware that were 3x's more expensive than Non-stop satin. The same thing happened in each case...the knives rusted after 2 or 3 times in the dishwasher. If you read other reviews you will notice that most often people complain about the knives. I have tried jetdry to see if there is improvement. BBB replaced the entire set.
1, Unique
1, Adventure Rather Than Sentiment: In this movie
1, The Wind: Warren Zevon shows us he is not ready to give up the ghost with this prolific and introspective CD. For fans who love his dark and sensitive sense of humor
1, Divine!: I had this book assigned to me in my English class. At first I didn't think that I would like such a wacky mushy love story
1," Recipes seem repetitive and distract from the theme: ""Like Water for Chocolate"
0, nothing new
0, Actually i'd rather give this piece of crap zero stars.: this book is too graphic. and the begining is so confusing. there's too many characters. and does the author reallly expect us to
1, Sex 
1, Perfect recipe and prescription for literary satisfaction: Mama Elena forbids Tita de la Garza to marry her true love Pedro. This
1, Tita
1," Great Book!: I believe ""Like Water for Chocolate"" Is one of the best books that I have read. Every time I read this book it gets better and better."
0, book needs to included updated information!: Book was very dissapointing. The author originally wrote the book a long time ago and claims to have updated information
0, Elephant in the dark: This is a deeply biased almost fictional and totally one sided account and portrayal of the history of Yugoslavia
1, Pre-revisionist and oh
0, Not a good source of History.......: During her travels through Yugoslavia Rebecca West was mostly accompanied by Constantine
0, A waste of time: My card refused to recognize three different peripherals - a Buffalo USB2 hard drive
1, Really cool!: bought this to have a little longer train for the Christmas tree. It is really cool!!!! Highly recommend this product!!
0," Not what I needed: This armband goes along with the otterbox ipod waterproof case. The case is so big and clunky that it renders the armband useless. I might as well strap a ""boom box"" to my arm."
1, Great!: I was really moved by this particular programme when it aired on television.It arrived in a timely fashion once ordered and it is of good quality. No extras
1, Breathtaking Rock at it's Finest: This import from the classic cult gang movie is the best CD I have purchased all year.I am especially moved by track 8 the baseball furies chase and the warriors theme. I would have easily given $50 for this excellent soundtrack. It is rock music at it's pinnacle! Barry de Vorzon creates a magic no other can duplicate! Do yourself a favor and order this gem!
0," Incomplete album: This album gets 2 stars based on the simple fact that Amii Stewart's ""Knock on Wood"" isn't on the soundtrack. Rediculous"
0, Expensive Transfer Belt Failed after light use - Awful Printer: My wife and I bought the Minolta 2350-EN Color Laser Printer 5 years ago and had about two years of good results followed by repeated nightmares culminating in a $360 repair bill that leaves us with a boat anchor. In all that time we could not have printed more than 4
0, Let me know: Can someone tell me what type of book this is? I really don't enjoy horror so therefore hesitate to read Stephen King
1, Great King read: Everything who has read King knows his writing is flowing and easy to read. This book is NOT a horror story! It is a great coming of age/relationship story of a young boy and an old guy. Actually
1, A recap and retrospect of the sixties: I have read a lot of Stephen King's books and this is one of the few that did not have an obvious ending. It was more of a trip back to the sixties and for those who were a part of it could be quite disturbing. It touched on alot of different aspects of growing up and living during one of this countries most volatile periods. Although it covers both sides of the war issue
1, Incredible Imagery and Characters: Stephen King has brought the past to life with a book that has both an interesting story line and wonderful characters. Having been born just a little too late to actually experience the sixties
0, Rather borrow than buy.....: Errrr..... I might be out of line here
1, Some interesting twists.: I am an avid Stephen King fan
0, Not bad
0, Really not that good...: I
0, Listen to the audio version if you are an insomniac: I tried to listen to this audiobook while driving... I WANTED to listen to this book... but William Hurt reads SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOW and like some smarmy college professor trying to impress people with his reading inflections. It was so bad that I couldn't make it through the first chapter. Maybe I'll try it again when I have a speed control or if someone else reads it.
0, Really Disappointing!: I was a great Stephen King fan but my interest in him dwindled rapidly over the years. After receiving two copies of this book for Christmas
0, I am never buying a Stephen King hardcover again!: Wait 'til this comes out in paperback-- better yet
1," Parts one and five make it are excellent: I thought ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" was fantastic"
0, Come again?: This book appears to be a collection of three different
0, maybe my expectations were too high.....: The book began as classic king
0," The first story was good...: ...too bad the rest of the book has nothing to do with Ted and his ""low men"". Read the first story and the last. The Vietnam war stuff in the middle just seems out of place and has little to do with the outcome. Not one of his best"
1, Mr.King at his very best!: I really enjoyed this book! King has created characters that are alive and moving. He shows how unforgiving the past can be but also how much hope the future holds. I'd love to see a story about Ted
1, It's a winner: I use this keyboard for my HTPC and it works great. Being able to completely control my computer from my couch without having to find a separate mouse
1, to you from a PS3: I am writing from my Versapoint keyboard on my PS3. The keyboard was design for the living room or classroom. The keyboard is compact and sturdy. It is strong enough to sit on your lap or grip with two hands to the side. What I like is the very responsive keypad. The mouse in mouse pad is convenient but slow and lagging. There are trigger buttons in the front.If I waited a little then I would have gotten the Bluetooth rechargeable from Logitech. The RF range on this pad is good with no interference at all. The BTC 9019urf Wireless Multimedia USB Keyboard is half the price and has a bettter mousetick
0, it okay..: the content of this book is ridiculously dry. I mean
1, Dark animation: I bought this one because it was recommended to me by the amazon recommendation engine based on me enjoying Svankmajer and the Quay brothers. This was a good catch and I would also recommend this to you if you have this kind of taste.
1, Tiny: Toy looks great (paint and posture is spot on). The only problem I had
0, GOTTA SEE THIS: I heartily recommend this turkey to anyone who is looking for a really good laugh -- or ten thousand of them. The script
0, ERRORS ON RECORDING: On the track See
1, Fantastico!: So far so good
0, Far too difficult to learn much through only listening in a car driving around: The introductory disc of Drive Time Italian employs the repetition and pace that is reasonable for this type of learning which is while one is driving and listening without textbooks
1, Drive Time Italian: escultate e repetete: A good program. Four disks -- great value for the money. Do give yourself time to learn the lessons
1," They've Still Got It.....: What can I say? ""I Could Fall in Love With You"" is the kind of giddy"
0, No Freakin Skulls: there are no skulls on the tape blade at all
1, Does NOT have Liszt's two-piano version of piano concerto no. 1: The Amazon listing incorrectly shows that this CD contains S650
1, Just what I was after: Got this to give a frosted look to some glass panels in our front door for privacy. It worked really well and just followed the instructions that came with it. I fitted it on the inside of the glass and found its a good idea to cut the piece just a little smaller than required as it does stretch slightly when squeegeeing it out. Also found the easiest way to apply it was to peel the paper backing off as you lay it on the glass surface. This helps prevent the adhesive folding back and sticking to itself. You do need to spend the time and effort squeegeeing out the bubbles and check it from both side to make sure you got then all.
1, Sweet and simple: We found this at a library book sale for 10 cents and what a bargain! It is a wonderfully simple
0, What a waste of money: Purchased this for my apartment just to protect sliding door and front door. First of all the unit had to be within about 10 feet of the front door to pick up the sensor. Deciding to work with this was a mistake. Within a few weeks the unit would start beeping for no reason and the only way to stop it was to completely turn off the unit. I am one of those individuals who normally bo not buy junk and i have learned another lesson.
0, You Get What You Pay For: I purchased this alarm for my pool house/storage shed. I didn't need much. I didn't get much. The alarms are not that loud. The remotes are lucky to work from 25 feet
0, A waste of money: For $59.00 the movie is a rip off
1, Atlantic Crossing: I am enjoying my CD very much. It came packaged as advertised and arrived promptly.
0, Poor flow: Not a Honeywell as the item title indicates. I get about half the air flow as I do through my original Honeywell filter that I have used for 2.5 years. Do not buy!!!
1, Great sound!: I bought these speakers for my iRiver MP3 player. I took this unit on vacation and am so glad I did. The sound was incredible. As good as my home stereo. Granted
1, Great Sound for the Size: These speakers put out exceptional sound
0, Why do they shut off automatically?: I bought these to have sent to Iraq where I am currently stationed. My wife received them in a timely manner
1, Love it!!!: I've owned this speak for over a year. The sound is so amazing with such a small size. This is also good for outdoor
1, great sound on the go!: great sound
1, Awesome .. But making the battery rechargeable woulda make it Awesomer.: I love these speakers because they produce full sound in a small package. But i would of loved to have seen it with a rechargable battery .
1, Nice little set of speakers: These were a pleasent surprise for the price. They are nice and compact which is what we were looking for to put on a kitchen counter. Yet they provide very rich sound for two small speakers.They only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is nowhere to set an MP3 player on the system.
1, Best Small Speaker set money can buy: The JBL On Tour speakers are just awesome. They look classy
1, Good sound in portable speaker: Good sound in a portable speaker.Wish it had a place for the connecting cord
1, Works Well With Zune: Bought a Zune 4gb could not use ear buds or headphones. Everything is made for ipod I could only find altec lansing im414 dock station it wasn't practical for portable use. Glad I read all the reviews especially about opening the package. You really can slice your fingers off. Take your time when you open it.It's pretty loud from 1-20 scale you can only use a 5-7 in an ofc enviorment. Fills a 20 x 20 room well. 4gb Zune has no eq but if recordings are base heavy you will be ok. Works A+ for Classical music B + for Jazz. Fits in my small shoulder bag very nice and has a carry bag. Looks really cool on my table. Jack location is in the rear should be on the side. Would really improve the product if a center sub wofer was installed.
1, Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer: This book was an excellent read. The authors bring to light some interesting facts heretofore not related to the public. The American lodger was never thoroughly probed in the press but apparently drew more attention from the Yard than they let on at the time. Discovery of the Littlechild letter helps fill in some long missing and important pieces of the puzzle. Including the information of several identical 'Ripper' killings in Jamaica and South America at a time Dr. T. was unaccounted for
0, Amazon online said pkg arrived
1, in cold blood: Very well written. Interesting. Kind of depressing but knew it would be due to subject matter.
1, One of the Better Ones: I rather enjoyed this book. The author does a good job telling a story that is rather depressing and scary. Given the large amount of book in this class
1, In Cold Blood: Riveting...excellent work by Capote. Reveals why there was substantial interest in making the book into a movie. Capote delicately balances compassion for the victims as well as for the perpetrators of this vicious crime. Highly recommended reading!
1, Loved it and hated it at the same time: I've wanted to read this book for years
1, true crime at its best: One small article in the New York Times brought Truman Capote to Holcomb
1," A ""Wordsmith's"" creation.: The movie was good but this book is much better. I felt like I was hiding in a closet"
0, .......zzzzzzzzzzzzz.......BORING!!: This book is a bore! This book caught my attention not because of the Capote movie that came out but because of the rave reviews that were given here. I would have to say this is not a bad book but it's about 12 hrs of my life I will never get back. If I had to do it again I would have rather read something else all together.
1, A True Crime Story: This book has all the components of a great book: Suspense
1, I'm glad my bookclub read this one.: This book was very well written. By not revealing the reasons for the murders
1, Best of Capote: The author
1, Goes well with Disney's products: My son can charge it and listen to or watch his videos at the same time. Great idea.
1, fox farm: I have recentley started some of the fox farm products and so far I like them they have work well for house plants and indoor bonsai
1, A nice grown up lip color.: NOT a gloss. Not for Barbie. This is grown up stuff. I have it in both Indian Red and Sayonara. Sayonara is a very nice true pink- a bit of brown in it that prevent it from looking like a 12 year old and best of all- no glitter or frost. Indian Red is what it sounds like
0, Decent music overshadowed by a truly annoying voice: As a real fan of Latin music
0, You pay for what you get: I purchased the flatware when I moved in my new home. ( at least 5 months now) Sadly I have to agree
1, A Timeless Christmas Collection: I am delighted that this album has been released in a CD! When I first heard it as a child
1, Beats the hell out of most of today's tired musical recipes: Tired of mindless pop
1, SIMULTANEOUSLY SAFE and UNSAFE: The collar glows in the dark to provide increased visibility. We had a black out and at least knew exactly where the cat was. This is also a breakaway collar!
1," Love the glow collar: This is a great idea. I don't have to worry about stepping on my cat when I walk around the house with the lights off. Only problem is my cat has a med size neck (from other custom collars I've ordered)and this collar is very large. I had to move the black plastic buckle to the middle of the ""plastic glow band"" in order to fit my cat. The glow part is plastic and stiff"
0, Kept coming off-A collarless cat is NOT the point of this purchase!: The reflectiveness on this collar is great but it loosens up constantly and the snap does not stay snapped. I started finding the collar various places in the house
0, Good CD for your collection...BUT DON'T LISTEN TO IT!: This is really an awful bunch of songs
1, is what is it
1, As advertised and great price: Exactly as presented
1, A very good book.: After 11 books
1, love for the washington squares: The Washington Sqaures winning
0, Sub Par for Francis: It had been a while since I had read anything from Dick Francis and I was in the mood for a mystery and saw Slay Ride at a used bookstore for $2.00. Let's just say it's a good thing that I didn't pay any more.The bulk of the murder-mystery story takes place in Norway. After main character
0, Horrible Sound Quality: The sound quality
0, Sounds of Summer - The Very Best of the Beach Boys: I remember them as being better than this. The recording was weak. There was very little dynamic range. Bass was absent. I was very disappointed. Better pass this one up.
1, Beach Boys: Bought this for my son who loves the Beach Boys
1, One Great CD!: This CD is full of the hits of the Beach Boys. In my opinion
1, Some of the Best of the Beach Boys: A lot of the early car songs and surf songs - what I really wanted - are here
0," A Mixed bag of audio recordings.: This review is on the sound quality of ""Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys"" . The music speaks for itself. I found playback on my computer (tried multiple drives) was terrible on tracks 2"
0, Great music ruined by the DualDisc format!!!!!: 5 stars for the music
1, why I love to read........: This world that these two main characters live in
0, Can be refilled locally: My local Walgreens store refills Dell ink cartridges; the printer does not recognize the refill and will not accept them. You can override the printer and force it to print
1, Fascinating Introduction to Bio-Inspired Technolgies: A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control provide a great introduction to fuzzy and neural systems
0, Rust: I purchased 18 of these bowls to use for feeding my cats their daily soft food treat. They are a great size
0, Not same as pictured: I had previously ordered the pictured product a year ago. I decided to order 4 extras. What I received is smaller than the original ones. Amazon is replacing 12 oz with 10 oz bowls!!! ripped off
0, stinks: Don't know how an animal could smell its food or enjoy its water around the very strong chemical smell spewing off the blue nonskid piece on the bottom of this dish.
1," Smelly: EDIT: In the past several months I have owned this product these bowls the rubber has ""hardened"" and no longer smells. So most likely the issue is that the rubber must ""cure"" over time. I still highly recommend these.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------From the other reviews"
0," What a WASTE of Ellen Page's talent and presence!: This movie was almost impossible to watch. The already mentioned ""multiple split screens"""
1, Ginuwine is da bomb!: This CD has amazing songs. Some of them include Why Not Me
0, What Was This??: It seems like Ginuwine just threw this album together. This is not what I was used to hearing from him. I was used to seeing Ginuwine as a slow ballad kind of person. I only found three songs that I liked on The Life.
1, ginuwine is da bomb: First off I think all y'all need to stop hatin just because Timbaland only produced one song thats no reason to hate aight. This man put a lot of hard work into this album. This album is the best one the G man has dropped since his first one the Bachelor. I think the best songs on here are There It Is
0, You get what you pay for.: This product is merely OK for lighter cords
0, 150 cord reel: Thisi a great product
0, Do not buy if you want to unroll your cable partially: The reel has no hole in the middle to pass extension cord through so you might unroll it partially.So you will need either unroll the cord completely and use the reel just as a storage or make the hole manually.That's what you have for the price.
0, Horrible: Had bought this for wrapping my 100' extension cord. Total waste of money
0, worthless piece of plastic don't wast your money: i threw this in the garbage after two seconds of inspecting itdon't waste your money don't waste your money
0, Cheap Plastic Wheel: This is very cheaply built plastic reel which is very weak and not worth the price and the product quality is poor at best.
0, Not for outdoor extensions: The description is misleading because it doesn't say it will wind up 150 ONLY if you have 16 gauge or less. Who uses an outdoor extension cord which isn't at least 14 guage.....???? Don't buy unless you have less than 100 feet of extension cord...
0, There are much better alternatives: Either unwind the whole cord or nothing at all. The trick of folding the cord in half before winding leaves the reel midway from plug to you
1, Very handy: This reel takes most of the hassle out of managing electrical cords. If there were a way to feed the plug out of the hub
1, Better than expected: Can be unstable if not supported - the base could have been a bit longer. One solution would be to bolt base to a 4 ft 2x6. But it works fine for the few times I use it each year. I have 100' 12g extension cord and I wind it from the center of the cord - much easier that way. There is a hook on the spindle so you can connet the cord easily with a tie-wrap.Very good value!
1, Excellent Resource for the arid
0, light of the western stars: I did not think much of it for being a good western book.not much to keep a person wanting to get back to book.
0, Don't waste your money!: I ordered this slip for my daughter
1, Identical replacement for what we had.: Identical replacement for what we had.Otherwise not much you can say.I hope I never need to know anything else about this.
1," Looks Gross works Wonders: My husband was recommended this because ""it works way better than Pepto"" and it really does.At first I had a hard time getting passed the consistency which is white and almost gelatinous and frankly looks perverse.My husband uses it any time he has stomach issues and convinced me to try it the last time I had a problem and it cleared up within a couple of minutes with none of the after-issues that Pepto usually has. I have to admit he was right about it."
0, Yet ANOTHER Woman Behind Bars Flick: This must be a cottage industry.The lovely Catherine Oxenburg plays the lead role here
0, Beware
0, Where's Neil?: If Neil is playing the instruments and not singing on this
1, warm and vanilla like.: I like casmir because it is warm and vanilla like. It is fairly long lasting and a good perfume for fall and winter
0, slightly cute but completely stupid: This book is a very dumbed down version of Electromagnetic theory. Unless u suffer from math or physics phobia
0," Description is not accurate!: Careful! This item is not what is described. It's not an ""assortment"" as indicated. The cords are all the same length (10"") and color."
0, TERRIBLE: I bought 2 of these bras
1, It's worth more than the shirt.: They got it in one. The sound that college kids flock toward
1, Musings on a broken-spined hardcover: My copy is nearing 25 yrs old and shows the wear and tear of living in backpacks
0, Warped: Every piece was warped. I was able to put it together
0, Can't fit furniture because of sloped roof: We purchased the Chalet without furniture because we own the Plan Toy Neo furniture sets (living room
1, Six Thumbs Up!!: I bought this for my granddaughter
1, Perfect!: Shipping was extremely fast! I opened the box and plugged it in to the 30 amp 240 volt outlet I have in my garage and it warmed it up fast. I have a 400 SQFT garage in the Chicago-land area (currently it is 10F outside) but it is 78F in my garage.The price was right
1, Absolutley brilliant!: This book is a very well illustrated study on the armour
1, Awesome: Fit perfect in my yankee themed nursery
0, Terrible for rabbits: The biggest problem with this litter is that it comes in the form of little balls that are the same size and shape as rabbit poop. There is no way of taking a litter scooper and simply sifting the rabbit droppings from the remaining clean litter. My rabbit prefers the litter to stay clean and it's hard to do that if I have to hand-pick pellets out. If you simply pour all the litter out and do a fresh one on an almost daily basis
0, expensive junk: I bought a bag of this at a local petstore to try it out on my ferret. Its litter and it does what its supposed to do
1, Great for Rats: I was using plain old kitty litter before I starting buying Critter Litter. I was such a mess it was almost not worth litter training. They would drag it around the cage and make a big mess. Now however
0, Not Good For Rabbits: I bought this for my rabbit
1, A fantastic read!: I love this book. It traces a family of women through thousands of years of history as they guard one of the most sacred books ever. It has a real sense of continuity and even though there is only a 100 pages or so dedicated to each woman all of their stories are developed thoroughly so that you feel strongly for each one. You sense the growth of a country and notice the changes of the world and it's attitudes as you move through the book. My favourite story was Ellen's - she was a really strong and admirable character. I've not read any other books by this author but I will try and find some. This book entertained me for several hours - I couldn't put it down!
1, Good representation of her works: A couple of the songs are not the full length album versions. Also
1, more than smooth!: Grab the wine
1, Soul to Soul: Sade has been the only woman that makes you listen to what she is saying being she has had as many setbacks as we all have..but she washes away her tears and fears and reinacts her feeling against the blackbard using the best of her fine tuned vocals within her inner self..Sade is this Beautiful Patite Women that alienates herself then unknown to be she comes out and reaches to us all by singing these outstanding words of wisdom to us like a Fairey of angels her soft spiritual voice intertwines with our Aura all her albums are extremely visual in our dreams.Glenda Jasper
0, Absolute garbage.: Track after track of the same beat
1," Simply untouchable: One of the greatest cd's ever. Sade has a voice that is so wonderful and sexy she could sing about the time you broke down by the side of the freeway with a flat tire and you'd think you had a great time.Every song on this ""best of"" cd is worth listening to over and over.Sade gets into your mind and heart and soul with her voice"
1," Provides good examples of successful mail order campaigns.: A good historical review of successful mail order campaigns. Contains a lot of print advertising examples with some background information about the sales it generated and the company behind it. Does not really spend a lot of time showing you ""How to""."
0, theres a reason its so cheap: The product looks great
0, Korean version better: I thought from the trailer it would not be that bad
0, Don't get the hype...: It was an okay novel. It was long and drawn out. I was disappointed
0, It's a good heater
1, For those who are serious in prehistoric arachaeology: I was once an undergrad in archaeology at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne
0, Think they're really good?: I think this is a very pretentious band. Mean come on 
1, Good
1, :): When this cd came out I was a pizza delivery driver for Dominos. I used to take this with me and play it wherever I went. There is something mysteriously addictive about this mix. Highly recommended for pizza delivery.
0, cute movie: this was a cute movie in my opinion but i think Hollywood is running out of movie ideas. we need some better story lines like nemo and lion king
0, BAD MOVIE: READ THE BOOK INSTEAD!!!: This movie is just plain awful. It is almost nothing like the book (they friggin' added parts in!)
0, B for boring: This was one of the most boring kids movies I have ever seen
0, Great book
1, Great story with a moral lesson: I bought this movie because of the previews. It looked like a cartoon that my little grandson would enjoy. He's 3 1/2 and is observant enough to understand a lot of things that other kids might miss. This movie was hard for him to follow. I couldn't leave and come back and know what was going on. So
1, Loved it and so did the kids: What I seen through this movie was a Tale of Faith
0, Disappointing to a Children's Movie Fan: We have a 7 year old daughter who is usually glued to the TV when we watch the newest released DVDs. With The Tale of Despereaux
0, Terrible edition: The idea behind this book is great but the book itself is frustrating with how many typos and errors are in the book. By unit 12 I had given up in frustration. One of the solutions midway into the problem they forgot the superscript on one of the powers
0, Really hard way of finding the answers: I don't know how many times I thought to myself 'I don't remember learning it this way at all'. I have graduated HS about 15 years ago
1, Simply the best.: Four years into the Christian life (1958) I was given this book. How did I like it? Thus far
0, A good second source for process improvement tools: Mr. Pyzdek treats the subject of organizational leadership
0, Pathetic
1, great movie perfict 5 star: When I first saw the movie I was use to the TV show people and I thought that it was good the way how Gary Burgoff played as Radar like on the show.This is a good funny movie.
0, Didn't like the commentary throughout the movie: Maybe I just didn't see it when I purchased the movie
0, Not the quality I expected: I did not buy this from Amazon.com. It was bought at a local store. I used it for about 6 hours total over 6 days. It will no longer turn on using either setting. I've tried unplugging
1, Love it: I bought this mixer to make sourdough bread
0, Missing almost everything!: I ordered this because it was a bit bigger than the standard 4.5qt and 5qt. and I do a lot of baking
1, Excellent product!!!: I've been waiting 12 years for a Kitchenaid mixer
1, Great mixer: My daughter loves her mixer!! She received this mixer as a wedding present from her dad and me. It turned out to be a great gift. It mixes her pound cakes perfectly.
0," Macy's Architect series...: We used at home 3 times the third one we realized that the ""steinless steel"" bowl was rusting. This series pretend to be the most trendy (...and expensive).Brought back to Macy's and bye bye"
0, kitchenAid YOU DO NEED AID: Well
1, Love this item: Great great mixer - I am sure it will last forever....I've already made twenty different kinds of cookies for the holidays with ease.
1, Made in America and it works great: Gave this to my wife for Christmas and she loves it. We all use it
1, Pleased
1, Love My KitchenAid !!: I'm very pleased with the KitchenAid Pro 600 - The bowl is big enough to mix 2 batches of cake batter or frosting. It has numerous speed settings and is easy to clean.
1, Great for Making Bread: I was worried because some reviews talked of a part breaking when mixing bread
1, KitchenAid KP26m1xcv: This is my KitchenAid Professional mixer. The first one works just fine
1, Kitchenaid mixer: Outstanding delivery in a timely matter. I ordered this kitchenaid mixer for my wife and as the UPS delivery person brought it to our house we opened the box and made meatballs for the whole family in just minutes. We love making bread without the the hard labor of preparing the dough. Great product at a fantastic price and great company dealing with the delivery. Thank you.
1, Love the KitchenAid Professional 600!: KitchenAid KP26M1XER Standup 6-Quart Mixer Professional 600
1, Kitchen Aid 600 stand mixer: My wife loves it for making her gluten doe it takes all the work out of the process... we are just a little concerned about the strange sound it makes on speed #3... gears sound as though they need some grease... hopefully it will clear up... it would be a major inconvenience to send it back for repairs after just receiving it. here's hoping
0, Cracked gear housing: I bought the high priced
1, AWESOME!!!: I have wanted a kitchenAid for many years
0, Design flaw: Be warned. While the product has heft and power
1, Top of th Line: This was an early Christmas present from my Husband this year. He had wanted to buy a KitchenAid mixer for years and I continued to discourage him..why settle for this mixer when I could have jewelry! I only wish I would have given in years ago. This mixer can do it all! We have bought almost all of the attachemsnt to go with it!! Well worth the money for sure. On our first attempt we made over 20 doxen noodles with the pasta maker in no time at all! The mixer has power to spare!! Don't be a fool like me and wait to buy it!! It is worth the money for sure!!
0, Disappointing
1, Love the Kitchenaide mixer: I bought the Kitchenaid mixer
1, Great Mixer
1, Great product!: I really enjoy this product
1, Kitchen Aid Warranty is excellent!: The new mixer we purchased did not work right the first time we tried to use it. It would only run on high speed and would shut off with in a couple of seconds each time we turned it on. I called the Kitchen Aid No Hassle Warranty phone number and with in a weeks time we had a new mixer and prepaid shipping for the old one back to the factory. The new mixer works like a charm and is everything we wanted it to be. It has power to spare and will last a lifetime I am sure!Our disappointment was
1, Kitchenaid mixer: Replaced a 30-year old Hobart that was a hit (until it died). This mixer works well but makes a grating noise; the initial use was successful
1, Excellent product: I am delighted with this product
0, Very Heavy
0, Does not cover mixer completely: The KitchenAid cover is well made
0, A Disappointment: I was kneading bread six cups worth and the gears went out. Now I need to have it fixed
1, This is nicer than my car!: This small appliance is a work of art with the power and upgradeability to do practically anything. I'm in love
0, Broken gears
0, Seller: Please contact me.: I bought this mixer almost exactly 10 months ago and have used it less than a dozen times. I was kneading bread dough and it just quit woking and started smoking. I turned it off immediately and unplugged it. It's completely fried and won't turn back on. Please contact me and let me know how to get a replacement. Thank you.
0, Look for a different mixer: We purchased the professional model thinking it would stand up over time. We only use it to make bread and pizza dough. It cant even handle 4 cups of flour. After moderate use the gears broke. This model should be recalled!
0, Junk Mixer: I would not buy this product again. The gear box housing is made of plastic and breaks very easily. Just look at the pictures that people have uploaded. I didn't use for the first year and a half then after 1 hour of total use the gear box cover broke just like so many other people. I called customer service and they told me it was out of warranty. Do your research first and don't buy. Fortunately I can buy a metal gear box housing on Amazon. What doesn't Amazon have. :)
1, fantastic!!!: I love this mixer!! I started with the kitchenaid 4 1/2quart mixer which was great but I was making a wedding cake and needed a bigger mixer. I mixes an amazing amount of batter. It does have a more metalic sound than my other mixer. I got the meringue color and it is beautiful. It has a pearly finish. The picture does not do it justice.
0, Worked less than two years: Worked pretty well for less than two years and that is a LOT of money to spend for a mixer than does NOT last and I only used this MAYBE once a week...probably more like twice a month. I never abused it or put more ingredients than it could handle (per the user guide). Even so
1, mixer review: I received this as a birthday present - what a wonderful gift!The color is fabulous - not a bright red as I was fearful
1, Fast shipping
1, kitchenaidkp26m1xnp mixer: i like this kitchenaid mixer it heip me a lot bake wery quick and is easy to wash .i will recomend this to friend 
1, A wonderful read!: Head Over Heels is just so much fun. It passes - and then some - the only test that matters to me: I couldn't wait to get back to it. I found myself thinking
1," Full steam(ers) ahead!: After reading other reviews prior to purchasing we are very satisfied with this steam pot. The day after we received it we had a small clambake in our back yard. The steamer worked perfectly. We used the stand from our ""turkey fryer"" as the heating element. The clams and the rest of our food turned out delicious. In fact"
0," REALLY LET DOWN: I saw wattstaxx at the movies when it came out in the 70""s. It was awesome. This version is like going to a movie and having the people behind you talk through the whole thing. You cant tell if Richard Pryor is funny all you hear is punch lines. You cant get into how finky the bands are because the commentators turned the music down so they can talk. wish i could get my money back."
1, Still good but the same old: It is worth buying if you are a fan or interested in knowing why others (like me) are interested in these guys. Some of the tracks are memorable. But
0, Weak spring: Disappointing product from Delta. The return spring for the pump is rather weak and as a result you have to pump the soap out slowly as it takes it time to return to the start position. I was even tempted to pull the top up to help it along.Also
0, very disappointed!: The pump just does not work! And since you have to pump and pump to get even a drop out
0, BAD PRODUCT: It may look pretty but the pump doesn't work. I purchased two of them and the both are junk. DON'T PURCHASE until they improve on the pump
1, A unique and interesting view of the future: Williamson creates a unique view of robots in the future. Humans create robots to help them with their work only to find things go awry. What makes this book great is the way it won't make you feel good by the end. That may seem paradoxical but it turns out to be refreshing and unique.
1, Who holds the power? The creator or the creation?: Awesome story! Never did I expect such a disturbing ending
1, Perfect!: Purchased this for my great nephew who will be 1 in October! My niece says he loves it and dances all around while watching it.
1, good but light: Great light reading for late at night. Some good gems
0, DOESN'T RING TRUE: Maybe it's too much to expect that every Annie Lamott book be great - but this one's a real disappointment. Annie tries to handle the impossible: the life-threatening illness of a beloved father who'd never had any medical problems prior to diagnosis within an addictive family - but the storyline wanders
0, Book arrived in bad shape: The first 2 pages of the story were missing and a clump of more pages fell out when I first opened the book. Does not use recyclable packaging.
0, The Yes
1, Grows on you...from a 1 to a 4: I hated this album when I first bought it. It sat in the rack for almost two years; I thought it was unlistenable. Then one day I took it out on a whim and decided to give it a real thorough listening. After listening to the whole thing through a few times
0, A Very Disappointing and Confused Effort: After Keys II it sounded like the old magic was back
0, Really no big deal.: I think the trouble with this album is that is has no soul
0, Useless: I am unable to use this product because none of the electrical sockets in my home has the strength to hold onto the electrical prongs of this relatively bulky appliance. This is definitely not one of those cute little plug-in heated-oil room deodorizers. This appliance weighs in at 1.5 pounds
1, Classic: This album is one of my favorites
1, It's time to go to Mars!: Every once in a while
0," Only for experts: I bought this based on a recommendation from a tech insider who said ""your tech teams will love it"""

1, Good addition to the collection.: I saw this movie as a child and laughed all the way through it. I still love it. Great entertainment
1, Pleasant Surprize: Yet another film I already knew about
1, my favorite: I first saw this movie a long time ago and it was not soon forgoten. I couldn't find it anywhere
1, Fabulous!: I have always enjoyed Simple Pleasures Books but this one is a definite favorite! It exceeded my expectations with gardening helpful hints and some outstanding recipes. An easy read and well worth the price!

1, Perfect: What can I possibly add to what has gone before me? Not for everyone
1," What Social Classes Owe Each Other: ""Not a damn thing."" As George Stigler summarized this classic case for laissez faire."
0, Speak Slowly Please: The first section of this course was fantastic -- they pronounced each French phrase very slowly
0," Beyond its one-note ""concept"
1, Turning your world upside down: Martin Amis has written a masterpiece. The idea is relatively straightforward: describe the life of the main character backwards in time. The brilliance is in the execution of the idea and the choice of the main character: bit by bit we find out that during the second world war the old man with which the story starts was a guard in a German concentration camp. So what happens if you write the story backwards? All of a sudden the villains become saints: dying people are become healthier and healthier uner the hands of the guards of the camp until they walk out of the camp intact. An amazing and thought-provoking novel that will keep you contemplating long after you have finished this excellent book.
0, interesting topic but rather obtuse writing: The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son

0, Sorely Lacking: Do Not buy this KINDLE edition. It does not contain any of the commentary
1, Great Resource: I love my MacArthur Study Bible. If you really want to understand the Bible
1, Outstanding
1, A MUST HAVE FOR THE SERIOUS BIBLE STUDENT: The McArthur Topical Study Bible is an excellent tool for students of the Bible who are preparing for sermons or who are plainly looking for passages on the Bible regarding certain topics. John F. McArthur
1, Very Good Quality: This is the first Kindle purchase and it was very exciting when we were able to down load and use.
0, The macarthur study bible new: The book itself was in good condition
0, The Bible according to John McCarthur: While this Bible does contain some very helpful study notes
1, Owen and Mzee: This story is wonderful. It's a great tool to use when teaching about love
0," not what I had in mind': I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I could not believe it when I received this ""collectible book"" and there was an ink inscription in in tthe inside of the front COVER!!!I was sick with anger at someone selling this as a collector item!I ended up putting a plaster over it with my granddaughter's name on it. So crumby!"

0, Not for digital cable: This device does not work with digital cable. Had to return it and purchased a Belkin unit insted.
1, Would LOVE to see this movie again.: I saw this movie when I was a little girl and have been looking for it for years! I have asked for it at every movie rental place in my town and they all think i'm making it up! If anyone knows a way to buy this movie
1, Loved it: I think it is a good movie
1, The horror of Civil War: Watching this film of how El Salvador was torn apart from 1980-1992 is something not only Salvadoreans remember
1," Overall a Truthful Account of a Dark and Bloody Time: While Oliver Stone's 60's-style ""hipness"" intrudes too much into the characters and situations"
0, Jagged Little Swill: This album confirmed all of my worst suspicions about Alanis Morissette. Jagged Little Pill was a landmark not only for Alanis
0, Not worth bothering with: I hedge that I've heard only Ironic and Hand in my Pocket on this album but those versions are sub-par. The songs in their original format should not he acousticized (is that a word?). A total remix of Jagged little pill (great album) would have been wonderful--something like what Linkin Park did with Reanimation or Sarah Mclachlan did with her Rarities album
1, Excellent comprehensive resource: Though this almanac is a bit out of date at this point
0, Don't buy Penley-Chinacrap: bought from filmtools some of these penley clothespins. Don't waste your time. GO to Ebay and find the real deal.
0," arm pocket has changed: I have previously owned 2 of these but now it is larger. The wrist is about 1"" larger in diameter and it about 3/4"" wider. The material is also lighter. I prefer the earlier type. I love the arm pocket concept and I have worn one daily for about 5 years in place of carrying a purse"

0, Bad Burners: I can't keep the burners from rusting. Owned it for 5 years and am ready for my 3rd set of burners. Cooks reasonably even and well when the burners aren't screwed up and flaming out.Supposedly the burners have a 15 year warranty on them. They must be installed by an authorized Frigidaire tech. The authorized Frigidaire tech in my area charged me $60 to do it. Frigidaire just said
0, Not that great of a book: Uselfull for experienced people in the field. You are expected to know the subject early on. the book mostly provied an example for each of the subjects and explains them tersly. This wasen't what i expected

1, My Favorite Wemba CD
1, Not His Best but very entertaining: This book differs somewhat from London's other novels. One thing that is great for a younger reader is that the book is written through the main character's perspective
1," A good mystery...: I usually do not do reviews with Amazon but after reading the previous one of this book I simply had to.I am a frequent reader of medieval mysteries and have read most of the ""classics"". With Michael Jecks series I found a new delightful author for myself.Even if historical backround may not be researched thouroughly enough (I do not know enough to judge this) I liked the book immensely.For me it was one of those books I simply cannot lay down. The mystery itself is surprising (even if the final solution is a bit aprupt and simple) and kept me guessing the whole book through. Furthermore I like the main characters - while defining the two major actors (bailiff and knight) in the first novel"
1, fine: The product didn't work exactly like I thought. The first night I took less than was suggested and was SICK
1, Great product!!: So I never ever wrote a review until now...The reason I love this product is because I have the WORSE colon issues; doctors kept doing test after test after test and did nothing but keep giving me different kind of pills. After months and months of fruastration with the doctors and taking pills that barely worked. I decided to do my own research and what I found was either surgery or go to someone different. Surgery would be my last resort
0, This made me sick: I started taking this on Friday and had some watery bowel movements the next day. I thought I drank enough water but I think I was wrong. So on Saturday night
1, Very effective: This product has been extremely effective. I used it in hopes of preventing contipation
0, Another whining soldier: I checked this book out of my library because I was curious to hear another woman's take on the US Army. I served for 7 1/2 years between 1977 and 1985 as a radio repairer mostly in the former West Germany during the Cold War. I left the Army to stay home with my babies.I found the substance of Ms Williams book to consist mostly of whining drivel. In the Signal Corps we consider Military Intelligence to be an oxymoron and in Ms Williams case that appears to be true. Don't let her fool you. Her experiences do not hold true for the whole Army. During my service I met very few men that I had problems with. Any high school student will tell you that if you are different life will be difficult.In the Army
1, Finding Forgiveness: Self-compassion cannot be overrated. If we can't forgive ourselves
0, Very Poor Copy: This particular version is so poorly reproduced that you can't make heads or tails of the many figures throughout the book. The tables & figures are not displayed as tables & figures
1, Fair Portrayal: The four-part documentary is well done
1," Decent GPS with some minor problems: Cobra is pushing the ""My Favorite Brands"" functionality in this device whereby you can specify your favorite retailers and the device will attach special icons to those locations on the map as you drive. Over 600 brands are available to choose from. There is an optional traffic receiver for the Cobra NAV ONE 2100"
0, Don't get this item: I tried to use the COBRA and was disapointed. We tried to look for restaurants and the three places we tried were not in the system. When we tried to enter a restaurant we knew was at a certain location
0, Not everything it says it is...: For the most part the GPS works just fine. It's late on telling you to turn sometimes. This Cobra has no idea if there is road construction

1, Excellent: I am an Electrical Engineer and had the usual education. It is a delight to read this book and learn about the fundamental theory upon which much of the Electrical Engineering profession is based.Much of what we are taught in schools is an approximation and sometimes wrong. It is great to learn
0, Unreadable format: The format for this book is just about unreadable with serveral lines of open space between sentences.
1, Wish the Photo was better: This is probably the only life sized replica you can find on the net.Pros:*Affordable*Life size*Trigger works & barrel spins*Comes with chain W/ Griever pendent*Comes with a full blade leather sheath that can buckel to your pants (if your pants can hold it up)*Comes with a standCons:*Like the other reviewers stated The lion emblem isn't so hot looking.*The Packistan label is right on the blade & clearly visable.*Griever pendent is shoddy. (looking at the back it apears like a diamond)(was never fully cut out of mold)*Bullet chamber is black*Slightly heavy
0, Sequel is lacking: Personally I found this sequel to be a far cry from the enthralling tale that was Knight Life. The narrative jumps around and it seems that David tries to hard to incorporate several other mythological literature heroes into the tale.The result is a storyline that doesn't flow and has no clear objective. I found myself struggling just to finish the book.Definitely a disappointment from the witty tales we are used to from this author.

1, Fantastic album: I first heard a live version of Una Muy Bonita on some weird internet pirate radio station in the late 90s. It totally changed my life right then and there. I grew up in school and college Jazz bands and had never been introduced to anything like this. Change is now one of my favorite albums.

I was looking to increase the effectiveness of my workout and already own one foam roller dvd that is very intense. When I received this DVD I was very disapointed; the reps are so short that by the time you start to feel anything the instructor moves onto something else. I think that out of the entire workout there was one exercise that felt like it was working. I would've GLADLY returned it if I could have

0, Ow ... hurts to use it: The design is not far from the infamous Apple's hockey puck mouse. It's pretty much a round mouse. This mouse will give you super carpal tunnel.Other bad things -1. The button for the thumb is tiny and far far below where the thumb naturally rests. Pressing the thumb button is a huge huge effort in a very unnatural and unergonomic position.2. The button that should on the right side of the mouse equivalent to the thumb button for the right has been placed on top of the mouse after the right button. This makes the mouse round and uncomfortable

1, Sporty yet Quality.: This bra got the attention of almost everyone driving by. Including some negative attention if you were driving your wife's car...lol What can I say some guys just are intimidated by purple. Kids always called my car the hot wheels car. It is a white civic with purple rims and purple bra with decals. You'll see it just look at the pic I uploaded. After three years we hit a massive summer of sun and the purple faded to pink. One bath overnight in some purple ritz fixed it right back up.

1," Finally!: Finally a book that tells the straight story about how to communicate effectively within an organization. I am always amazed at how HR departments fail to understand how important effective communication is as a management tool. Baney gives clear and concise advice about how to make sure that you have made clear your expectations and your obligations in a way that will make you one of those people whose word ""you can trust."" Good stuff!"
1, 2 different ratings?: I just watched this movie for the very first time. I'm a Steve Mcqueen fan
1, Excellent: Although a less-than-accurate adaption of the book
0, The worst experience ever 1: I attempted to spray a fungicide on my lawn with this sprayer. After spraying for about 20 minutes I realized that the product was not being drawn up into the hose spray. I checked the tubing
0, Don't waste your money--this does not work.: This product was an absolute waste of money. It did not work.Not even after I also purchased the ortho singles application Weed B Gone 4-pack bottlesand followed the directions on the package.I sldo did a google search looking for videos demonstrating someone successfully using this product and nothing could be found. Wish I could get a refund.Save your money and try something else.
0, another disatisfied customer: The first year I used it it worked fine. I left insecticidal soap/water mix in it over the winter. So I guess I have no right to complain
0, used to be good
0, Tax Evasion for Dummies: Here's good reading while you are doing 10-15 years for tax evasion. Get an accountant and forget about trying to outsmart the IRS. There is nothing the IRS doesn't want you to know. The problem is it is way more than you will ever know. Tax codes are the number one killer of trees.
0," Get the regular ""roll"" kind instead: I bought one of these from Macy's a while ago. Since it's a little cheaper than the other roll type (looks like a toilet paper cardboard tube)"

1, educationally enchanting: my granddaughter who is 7 loved this video. i also enjoyed it. it gives you a perspective on how we're encroaching on what should be protected.
1, fun for toddlers
1, Good Game: Got this for my girlfriend at the time now wife. She liked it for about 5 months. Does not see much use now but is a really fun game.
1, My favorite book as a kid....: This is the most amazing story of a young child who has to learn quickly and grow up fast. It also teaches a lot about living off of the land. I read this book over 20 years ago and when I finally saw it in print last year again
0," Just poor quality: I have been buying ""THE MOUNTAIN"" T-shirts for years"
1, THE BEST PLIERS AN ELECTRICIANS $$ CAN BUY: Honestly I am extremely happy with this set of pliers
1, Adorable illustrations: This short little board book is adorable! We love the illustrations and the cute little story. My son likes this mainly because it is about two cute dogs (we have 3 dogs) and the illustrations show him easily what is going on in the story. Very cute book.
0, OK
0, Not as Expected: The product received was actually only 1L
1, The Best -- Just the Best!: Charlotte's Web is a graceful
1, Friendship is true: This story is about the friendship between a spider and a pig.A kind and caring spider called Charlotte saved a innocent pig called Wilbur from being killed by the Zuckermans.They went through many hardships together with the help of other animals in the barn
1, I love this book.: Once there was a pig named Wilbur. He had to go through a lot when he was born. I love this story so much! My favorite part is when Wilbur made friends.
1," My ""Charlotte's Web"" Review: ""Charlotte's Web"" is a book all ages can enjoy.I really liked the story because it teaches friendship.The begining of the story is believable but in the end it is like a fairy tale. I liked the characher Charlotte the best because she was kind and wise.The ending is bitter sweet. Lauryn L."
1, Unlimited Stars!: I think Charlotte's Web is one of the best books I have everread. I love this book so much
1," A quietly enjoyable book: ""Charlotte's Web"" is one of the books that I remember fondly from my childhood (as well as the several times that I've read it now that I'm nominally grown-up.) Even though I know each time that I will cry"
1, Amazing Story. And it's not just for kids!: This is a beautiful story which I read when I was about 11 and I have never forgotten the story and it's a book that I never get tired of. It's a story about friendship
0, VERY BAD!!: I didn't like this book because it had a rotten and badending. This book wasn't the greatest.
1, The book gets read and reread.: My six year old grandson has read this so many times that the pages are taped together and I am now ordering a new copy for him. He loves to read his favorite books over and over and Charlotte's Web is certainly one of his favorites.
1, Fantastic introduction to chapter books: We read Charlotte's Web very early - my son was four. Since that's a good deal younger than the suggested age
1, Wonderfull!: I love putting this cd on as background music and it adds a wee touch of nobility to the humble home
0, A Review: I have read several of Marian Keyes books. They were entertaining. However
1, Constitution Book: It's the Constitution of the United States; what's NOT to love? The book is small
1, Constitution Book: Great product; fast delivery. I give these out to my Airmen as a reminder to why they server thier county. We keep it in the left breast pocket of our uniform nearest our heart!
1, Every American Should Re-Read or Read for the First Time: First
0," DON'T BUY THIS BOOK: I bought this book several months ago and did not notice until the recent news reports that this is the copy that has the disclaimer that ""this book is a product of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today."" DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
1, Good but mine came off-color: Love the functionality - being able to separate for different uses esp. meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan. But mine came off color (sorta transparent) at the corners (and this wasn't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value - not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique.
1, Great for what it is intended for!: I haven't had an accounting course in 10 years
1, Well Done!: Brilliant story. I bought Wrong Trousers for my 3 years old daughter. She usually laughs when watching other cartoons but not as much as when she watches this one. What I like about Wrong Trousers is it makes her think and she would ask me many thoughtful questions about characters.
1, Invaluable: There are a million books on starting businesses

1, My Yogourmet from Amazon: I'm getting used to making yogurt
1," A Truly Amazing Journey.: This is one of the most fantastic books Ive ever read. Both journeys the spiritual and the physical on which author Robert Prisig takes is absolutely breathtaking. If you want to read one philosophical book read this anf yu will be blown away!The kind of dexterity with Mr. Prisig alternates the metaphysical and the physical journeys is a highly appreciable. After reading this book ine feels strongly to go on a motorcycle journey and be "" in the scene"" . Equally evocative and beautiful is the introspective journey.After all ""the real cycle you are working on is yourself"". I really hope Mr. Prisig takes out its sequel"
1, Magnificent example of metaphysical excellence: This book succeeded in forcing open the rusting mind of humanity and setting precedence for aspiring philosophers and theologians to come.
1, What is best vs what is right: Although this book requires a bit of reflection (so is therefore not a fast read) it provides a great explanation of ZEN philosophy - the key points summarized are: Western Philosophy = What is right vs wrong
1, Finding Truth from a unique perspective: I think this book should be considered as a course prior to do any kind of research. In this book

0, Disappointing: There are some good reviews already about why this is a bad book
1, A Zen Philosophy: Probably written for a specific reader
0, TERRIBLE!!!: This is an abosolute DISGRACE TO BEETHOVEN'S MUSIC!!! The music is Far below the tempos that Beethoven originally wrote. The quality of the recording equipment is also quite terrible. I was extremely displeased with these pieces. I now have learned a valuable lesson.. NEVER PURCHASE INEXPENSIVE RECORDINGS! They tend to be of poor quality.
1, A superbly written and complex fantasy novel!: A young prince who could inherit his kingdom finds an evil great-aunt stands in his way
1, An absolutely superb release.: This recording has something for everyone. To be sure
0, PATCH OF BLUE: I don't like this book because I felt like it was missing apart. It never told how Gordon felt in the end and what all the people did. With they gathered around Selina. How did Ole pa react to it? Do Rose ann and Ole pa ever find out about Gordon? The book never told if she went to the school or not and if she met Alice. The book was not long enough for me. It could of use one more setting. That's why I don't like this book.
0, Well intentioned but...: The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed
1," True story about courage and stamina: Wonderful story about a girl child that has a dream and sticks with it even thou there are so many ""road blocks"" in her way. LOved the characters and how she accomplished her dream."
1, Ryan at Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary: I give this book five stars because it is a great book. Charlotte is a very smart person. I think all age groups would love to hear or read this book. I like the part when Charlotte tells Mr. Millshark to go and help her get the carriage out of the mud. He has to take off his boots. Charlotte takes his boots. It was funny. I think Pam Munoz Ryan is an awesome writer because her writing is so interesting. I think Brian Selzinck is an awesome illustrator because his illustrations are so realistic.
0, disappointed!: We waited for months for this to be released and we were thrilled that it finally shipped. Unfortunately
1, Foood: Every time we get to discover a part of the word by its food and culture its wonderfulthank you for doing such a great job.... this is something you have to get if youare a food lover and enjoy traveling

1, crocks for mom: I got these for my mom as a gift
1, Perfect for our uses: We had bought frozen French Onion Soup at Costco
1, Very cute set but..: This is a really cute set with lids but there is no proper packaging for this at all. Buyer has no protective bubble wrap or wrapping paper. Received 2 ceramic bowls (half the set) that were completely cracked and broken and unusable. Why not take some time to properly package these delicate ceramic bowls.
0, Meh.: I felt compelled to review this myself after buying the book based on the reviews posted here. Almost all of them were glowing
0, Can We Say Ridiculous?: I gave this book two stars just for some writing style and building some suspense. The author does an okay job with that. But if you know anything about the Bible
1, The best beef stew seasoning!: Can no longer get French's Beef Stew mix locally
1, Kudos to Laurence Yep: Wow! To be honest
1, The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal
1, First-rate!: Who would expect a book about a feat of civil engineering to be fascinating? Not me
1, The Path Between the Seas: Read the book and it sure had my attention all the time. I also passed this book onto a friend of mine. She also gave it a favorable rating.

1, The golden one: The Peabody mysteries are the best series I have ever read. She makes you feel that you are right there seeing her life unfold. The mysteries of Egypt are astounding and funny. Great book.
0, Great connectivity; when it works: This SD card works fine
1, Works great...: You can plug it right into your computer...only if it handles the 2 gig cards. My laptop would not recognize the card. I also had to buy a new card reader because mine wouldn't recognize that size.
1, Excellent USB Key and SD Card: I previously owned the 1GB version of this card and was very pleased with that. This is a great improvement as it doubles the space! I've had no problems with it used as a USB key or SD card.The ONLY issue I have had with these cards is they DO NOT work in the Nintendo Wii. They WILL get stuck inside the Wii slot and with-out carefull pliers work you won't get it out. The card electrically works in the Wii you just can't get it back out. Same with the 1GB version. This is more a design problem with the Wii (which I still love) than with the SanDisk card. So get the card
1, Not perfect
0, world war stories: The book was easy reading and interesting. I thought the book is overpriced for a paperback and the size.We have heard good reviews about this author who writes of his true experience during World War II
0, Expresses the author's personal ego: This is Burgett's personal account in Operation Overlord. I have the greatest respect for what Screaming eagles did in Normandy
1, Curahee!: Wow It's hard to believe I will be able to get my hands on this book. I have been serching for 18 years to have this book again. I let someone borrow mine in '82 and have been searching ever since. I have never read a book where I felt like I was actually there. This book changed that for me. Just like one of the other reviewers I also could only think of Curahee as I watched the scene in Saving Private Ryan where they were talking to the Pilot that flew the glider. If you have a chance this is a must read. This has always been my favorite book. EVER!
1, MAAN: All I got ta say is this cat z-ro is as real as they come. He is the pac of the dirty south.Nobody in tha game is on his level and they sure ain't keepin it real wit the music like he is.Alot of people haven't heard of him

0, The Secret History of Lucifer: A quite mediocre read
0, Huge Disappointment: If you've ever read any of her other books
1, A Great Read: The most inspiring book that I ever read. It's funny
0, Nice toy but too big for a small dog.: After reading the reviews I thought this would be a nice toy for my miniature dachshund who loves any plush toy that squeaks. She was very excited when I pulled it out of the box and squeaked it but once I gave it to her she had a really hard time getting her mouth around it and squeaking it herself. She picks it up once in a while but I can tell its not one of her favorites because it takes too much effort for her small mouth to squeak it. Probably better for a medium size dog.
1, Not bad
1, Fun toy: The noice maker the monkey makes & has is different from the small bubble other toys have inside & my small dogs enjoy it.
0, Jobst stockings: I could not even put my feet in the stockings. They are absolutely worthless unless you have a trained person to put them on you and take them off. I wanted them for circulation problems. This did not work at all

0," One of Franco's ""better"" movies. That is not good.: Make no mistake about it"
0, It is not a Barrel. It is a bottle of over priced stuff: It is just over priced. I paid $30 plus $10 shipping for this. I could get these stuff from a local craft shop with half the cost.
0, Good tacky 70s fun: What can you say? There's no great art here. There's Teresa Graves
1, Flash from the past!: I remembered this movie from high-school. I wanted it mainly to get ideas for a 70's theme party and I remembered the star role was very classy/chic. The clothing was on-target for what I was looking for. Quite humorous as I've matured alot since then. But is still good to reflect on what was then vs. what is now.Very nostalgic!
1, Miracle Stories: This book describes the founding of a satellite television network and it's phenomenol growth
0, Not the best book I ever read: Unlike everyone else in the world

1, one of the better seasons: i thought the series decreased in quality and enjoyability a bit over seasons 2 and 3

1, Wonderful Blu ray rendition: Just got a new blu ray for Christmas and bought this as part of our Christmas tradition of watching It's a wonderful life . They did a wonderful job in getting all improving the quality and making this movie special on HDTV. Thank you
0, Traditional Holiday Movie: Stewart gives an excellent performance to an otherwise silly tale. Non-sensical
1, It really is a wonderful life: This is our favorite Christmas movie. I'm so glad that they offer a blu-ray version with both the B&W as well as the colorized one. The extra featurette is also a lot of fun.
1, Oldie but Goodie: Purchased for my husband. This movie doesn't seem to be run through the Christmas the it used to be and we missed it this year.
1, It's A Wonderful Life: This movie is great. I ordered it thinking it was in color.The web page had the format in color
1, A true classic.: I have seen this film many times and yet it remains one of my favorites.Although this film was made well before the days of HD
1, I love this movie: I haven't gotten to watch this DVD yet because of my husband spending the Christmas week in the hospital but I am delighted to own this copy of one of my favorites. It just isn't Christmas til we've seen this one.
1, It's a Wonderful Movie!: It doesn't get much better than this. What a wonderful family movie
1, makes you think: Whoever doesn't like this obviously is not a very introspective person. I am
1, Pure classic: Watch it every Christmas. Such a classic. Never gets old. Never goes out of style. Will pass onto my younger generations.
1, Perfect movie all year!: Such a good heart-warming movie! I could watch over and over again! It doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy it!

1, pine needles in our hair: this is how it is. the album is absolutely amazing. this cd in my discman accompanies me into sleep every night. i never tire of his voice spinning the most fabulously depressing tales. his eeriely perfect voice weaves its way into my thoughts. it makes me want to show up randomly at his door. we would let the woods or a junkyard find us wiling away the day.
1, This is a bargain!: Western with lots of cool characters
0, Crippled Functionality: Once again
1," Excellent made-for-TV WW2 true story: This is the best made-for-tv movie (broadcast network) that depicts true events I have ever seen. Rutger Hauer and Alan Arkin are excellent as a Russian POW and a Jewish concentration camp prisoner who lead an uprising in a German concentration camp. It left me feeling ""at least SOMEONE in a concentration camp stuck it to the Nazis."" It also made me wish more had been able to. It's surprisingly graphic for a made-for-tv movie (I think it was on CBS); it shows naked women lined up to enter the showers (gas chambers). Just a word of warning to parents."
1, Review of Escape From Sobibor: This DVD was purchased from Amazon as a Christmas stocking stuffer.This movie ts based on the true story about one of the greatest escapes from a German concentration camps duringworld war two. It was the only organized escape by Jewish prisoners.The movie tells this story with suspense and great acting. It is well worth watching.
0, escape from sobibor: I haven't read the book yet(although I did purchase it from amazon) but I feel the movie gives the lay person a good view of things that happened during the holocaust. This is definitely a very different view of the terrible things that happened. I remember when I was in junior high school having the impression that the Jews did nothing to help themselves. This was the impression the students were given by the teachers at that time. I never
0, DVD Quality: I watched this movie about 15 yrs. ago and was so excited that Amazon had it available. The only bad thing is that the DVD's quality is horrible! And this is suppose to be a remastered edition? I paid the extra money because I thought it would be digitally enhanced / dolby digital
1, Just as if I got it from the store!!: Excellent seller. Fast delivery
0, butchering: If you think there is a final line no movie should even close
0, just aweful: This is right up there with one of the worse movies i've ever seen. So many things made no sense at all. What was the role of the Brazilian actress in the film and wow this guy gives up on his wife pretty quick. I guess humans must be pretty advanced to be able to have all these man made body parts including optic eyes and still be able to survive.. I highly suggest renting this before you buy it
0, All guts
1, Life Changing!: This documentary changed my life
0, Pathetic: I hope that people how have not experienced real slaughterhouse or farm life get some and do not take this film too seriously. Leave it to a group of young naive New Yorkers to attempt to educate society on the brutality in our food supply. The title Vegucated is laughable. Vegetables are good and good for you but that has very little to do with this film. They try to gore the unknowing into not eating meat instead of convincing people on the health aspects of veganism. It's kind of sad how low quality the film is. There would be nothing wrong with watching it if you can stay awake and don't pay for it by having Amazon Prime.
0, Veducated lacks professionalism: The photography is very amateurish. The crossover between vegetarian and vegan is blurred. It is more like a high-school project than a movie made for public education.
0, Go watch Forks Over Knives instead: Let me start this review by saying that I am a vegan
0, Skip it: This doc was not only very poorly done and the director annoying
0, This movie needs to be RATED for viewer caution: I was not at all prepared for the pure GRAPHICNESS of this film. This film should be rated at least PG-13 if not R. I did not see a rating on it at all
0, economy holster...: The holster is functional. It doesn't seem to fit any revolver exactly right. I have tried it with several Smiths
0, Squeaker died within minutes
1, Thanks Ellen!: Please be careful reading the not so nice reviews. Remember
1, Great value!: The ink cartridges were just as described and saved me a whole bunch of money. I use this printer for making digital hybrid paper crafting projects and so far the quality is good.
1, Wonderful uplifting reminder of the simple things in life: Geologist and writer Rick Bass muses about time and natural processes
1, My favorite movie of all time!!!: This movie is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time. I was lucky enough to receive the VHS version as a gift 5 years ago
1, one of the best: I love Jimmy Stewart and this is the movie i love him in it. That and It's a wonderful life. I have been searching for it EVERYWHERE! I can't seem to find it and I love the movie. It's one of the best. I love mystery and it's a mystery!

0, rear window (region 2): Didn't realize when I purchased this product that there were different regions for dvds. I asked the seller what the refund process was and how much the cost difference would be to get a region 1 dvd but did not get a response on that question. Not very happy with purchase. Will not purchase from this seller ever again unless I can get this remedied.
1," Great Mystery for all You Hitchcockians: Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) plays a bad guy. That's the only bummer in this Hitchcock mystery. James Stewart has the lead role. They don't make mysteries like this anymore. HD movie makes the difference on my 55"" screen. It creeps you out like you're right there. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. See if you can see Alfred Hitchcock in the opening few scenes. He made a cameo in all the movies he directed if you didn't know that bit of trivia."
1, Alfred Hitchcock at his best!: Old movie really well done. Great story
0, Unable to view: The product is great but my download only did 3% of the film. I've seen this film before but airport WIFI not great.
1," Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece: This movie shows Grace Kelly at the peak of her beauty. Only Hitchcock can make the story of a ""voyeur"" this interesting to ""watch"".The picture quality on this DVD is excellent & in letterbox format to boot. I only buy DVD in letterbox format"

1, Hold tight: Good service & quality.. On time and as advertised.Will continue to buy online due in part to the quality products & service.
1, Perfect!: For serious riders who have more than one bike this is perfect. My touring bike has the smaller diameter handlebar while my road bike has the larger diameter handlebar. I needed two adapters but only one mount. Great price too!

1," a song for every mood: The best selection from ""Beaches"" movie. Roger's rendition is good. His selections from his native country (so. Africa)are excellent"
1, Short and sweet - It's worth buying if you like RPG's.: It's an interesting example of how far you can take a system
0, puzzle collection: I did not get a variety of scenes - two of each puzzle instead of different puzzles. That means it wasn't as much of a value as advertised. RIP OFF! Didn't get the puzzles pictured either.

0," I really didn't care for it! Overrated: I thought the crystal method's ""music"" was too technical and computer produced. I bought it because I liked ""busy child"" (from the GAP commercial)"
0, not happening dude: I have to say after becoming accustomed by djs and producersthat actually have talent
0, lame: crystal method are a joke. missing the point of electronic music completely and creating repetitive unoriginal tracks. no wonder they became so popular
0, Crystal Method Scores a Zero: I've been listening to techno and all it's other little byproducts and whatnot for a few years now. The first cd I picked up from the genre was the Crystal Method's Vegas
1, Buy it! Now!!: If you like Fluke and The Prodigy
1, Four Stars: I know very little about this kind of music
1," Great For Speed Bagging!: This is excellent music for ""Punch Drumming"""
1, Bruce Who?: One of the more bizarre productions in the martial arts genre
1, Everyone is missing the point.: First off the movie is an obvious comedy that knows it is being funny. It IS a funny movie that is a piss take on all the fake Bruce Lee movies being done at the time. The violence is comic to start with. Scenes like the eyeballs are played for laughs. Making Lee's voice fem was an obvious joke too
1, Great CD's: Bought this CD set for my wife for Christmas and we both enjoy falling to sleep to the sounds. No music. Just the sounds of nature. I highly recommend this set. A really good bargain too!
1, Very Good: The cinematography is excellent
0, Disappointing: Perhaps the delirium here is that Harris
1, an extraordinarilly beautiful record: This album is so unbelieveable. Man
0, After a year: After almost a year
0, Complicated: This is too complicated for most people to understand. If I needed a textbook
0, I Want my 90 Minutes Back
0, Sucked and not in a good way: Wow. I thought (mistakenly) that this could be good campy humor
0, Check the drawers: This book is not very informative. It is easier to look in you wife's drawer and see what size lingerie she wears. Then use your imagination to see what she would look like when you are at the lingerie store.
1, A unique and creative tool: I have been creating rustic woodsy baskets as well as teaching classes for Fifteen years.Im always looking for new good quality books to learn from as well as share with my students. Natural baskets shows supplies easily collectable from your own backyard or near by woods
1, Spirit of emptiness: This cd is a little piece of jewellery of zen music
1, Difficult to put down-better than Spandau-Phoenix
1, A page turner: A very compelling read. My wife and I both read it and loved it. We picked up another novel by Mr. Iles and are looking forward to it.It is definetely worth your time.
0, NOT the same calibre as other Iles texts despite glowing recs: I grabbed this book with excitement
1, Like the expanded short story: the longer devoloped held you understand the storyline betterbought this on VHS
0, Awful!: As a reader who appreciates Bradbury stories
0, Not worth the money: The ball itself is great
0, not satisfied: I bought this for my baby's first birthday. It looks cute on her but there are some details that I don't like. 1st
0, Wrong Alloy!: This product is mislabeled. Twice I was sent a tube made from 6063 not 6061. 6063 is not as strong
1, universal aluminim splint: Used it on a patient that broke both wrists. I wish I had 2. The outside coating is not quite as heavy duty as Sam- splints but well worth the price
0, DO NOT BUY!!!: This is a very bad product. No matter how careful you are
0, WARNING-incorrect description: This item clearly states that it includes a roller fairlead
1, Mercedes Lackey does it again.: This is absolutely the best of the SERRAted Edge novels
1," ""Columbia Men's Bonehead Short Sleeve Shirt Big"
1, A Brilliant Display of the Novel: Taking into account the scope of the book
0, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER !!!: I liked the book DUNE very much. When I saw the movie
0, Genre fans only: Good special effects and a mouth dropping production design can't overcome a rather vague and oppressive plotline. The idea of being able to hear what the characters are thinking wasn't very bright.
0, disappointment: After devouring the entire Dune series I really looked forward to the film. In some ways it is quite nice. The special effects & all of the obvious
0," A weak attempt at a classic: For fans of the worlds of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" this is a sorry exercise and a total waste of film. Hopefully the 3 disc saga put to film by the Sci-Fi channel (directed by John Harrison) will get the full Blu-ray treatment. In the meantime I'll wait. Thanks but no thanks"
0, Skip This Embarrassing Mess: Having just read the book
1, great classic on a superb disc !!: this movie is a true classic and now it`s here on HD-DVD !!! the image quality is awesome for such a old movie and also the audio track is very nice . to bad this is just the standard version and not the director`s cut 
1, 'Bout time: I have been waiting for this release since DVD players came out. I am pleased to fantasize that by February my fantasy will be reality.While I enjoyed the Sci-Fi channel miniseries
1, Pretty good: Well... I'm not really sure what I think yet. Whoever did the costumes and scenery was really brilliant. That was almost exactly the way I pictured the Dune universe. I also loved Patrick Stuart as Gurney Halleck. However
1, It grows on you: The very first time I saw this movie was on television where they aired a special 190 minute version which contained important scenes and a more detailed introduction that makes the movie a lot easier to understand. With out a doubt this has to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made visually. I have seen this movie countless times and each time I am amazed by the special effects. I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 because you have to watch it more than once to understand it. There is just too much going on in this movie than can be taken in the first time you watch it. I also highly suggest watching the extended version to get a far better understanding. If you like to let your imagination go free
0, Yikes! Finished reading Dune
0, What a disapointment...: Well
0, Certainly Not The Dune I Imagined: I remember being so excited to see the movie adaption of my favorite SciFi classic. It was disappointing . . . almost a caricature of the book and not at all what was conjured up in my mind
0, This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by the book.: This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by Frank Herbert in his Dune books. Not only does it ignore some of the most important aspects which Frank Herbert included in his books
0, A poor use of DVD; a poor print of a primarily visual movie: The DVD edition of Dune was poor
1, WOW
1, A definite must-see: Many of the other reviewers are right. Many things are left out that were in the books. But if you judge Dune the movie by movie standards
1, Wow! A Movie You Can Say You Enjoyed...and not lie.: Dune is a movie about the another galaxy
0, Skip This Embarrassing Mess: Having just read the book
0," What exactly was the point of this release?: OK...So. We finally get an region 1 release of the ""extended"" version of the film. Along with the theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars"
1, Read the book
0, The Blu ray did not play.: I have not returned this blu ray product but it did not play in my Blu ray player.. I ahve a Panasonic player that does not link up with the internet. That may be the issue.. I would suggest you make sure it plays before you buy.. I will say
0, 2 stars cause I like the floating guild dude: This movie is like reading the first chapter and then a bulleted outline of the rest of the novel.It begins okay
0, Not even close!: I can't believe some of the reviews for this piece of trash that I've read here. Did any of those people actually READ the book? Apparently not
0, Now I know why only $3.99: I should have known the price was way to low. Looks like they are trying to unload these on the uninformed consumer. It is my fault for assuming that this would play on my Blu Ray player
0, Save Your Money: So awful you have to laugh to keep from crying. The dialogue is almost impossible to listen to
0, How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.......: Lynch
1, Fun flick: The movie retains most of the original story. It was fun to watch
1, These are the best flip flops I have ever owned: I have owned a pair of Island Slipper Men's flip flops for almost 20 years and worn them every summer. I have been waiting for them to wear out so that I could justify buying a new pair. Actually I didn't realize that I could buy them online. Other than a little wear on the sole and some spots where they have conformed to my feet they are like new. The are also the most comfortable pair of flip flops or sandals that I have every worn.
0, Reprint of a 1987 book
0," Returned this costume: This costume was awful - I turned right around and returned it. I am 5'4"""
1, Introduction to.....: This album
1, Another good biography by the D'Aulaires: This biography of Washington is more detailed -- 3rd through 5th graders will gain a lot of information in a still-fun book. The illustrations and format make this an approachable book for kids who are just getting started with non-fiction reading.Plenty of personal details
1, Very interesting look into the the life of our First Great President.: First off its free for the kindle
0, Keep Away! Gets too hot.. SHoddy and broke right away: This light broke right away... after using it maybe 7-10 times the switch broke and it no longer works. Plus it gets VERY hot... there are other better choices!
1, Good buy: My parents freaking love it. Don't be shy... buy it now. DO IT! DO IT NOW!!!! That is all. Derp.
0, Man of the House and Travelin Tyke: I dont really like this movie. Kinda like a Home Improvement TV show for 2 hours. Boring and predictable
1, Tremendous Relief for Sinus Headaches: This works great for soothing the pain of sinus infections. It covers the complete sinus area from frontal to maxillary
0, Nothing new here...: Lets face it
1, Purity in Death by J D Robb: The continueing saga of Eve Dallas and her search for truth and justice. The back drop of the future and the changes that have taken place are realistic enough but not out there. Although Eve pulls no punches and tells it how it
1," Once again she does it!!: I must agree with the reviewer with no "" real review"". She is truly phenomenal.The In Death series is the best suspense series out there and the trick is the books just keep getting better. You absolutely cannot wait until the next one is published. Ms Robb has the talent to build characters"
1, Wow: Great product--works well and made well. Less than half the price than if bought at local retailer. Would recommend this product for Nokia phones.
1, The Good
1, A Leo Movie: Another Leonardo DiCaprio movie. I enjoyed it immensley as it shows how talented an actor he is. He seems to be able to drawn me into the emotional complexity of the character but I felt I still did not truley know the character. The other actors were for me
0, A Reader From Texas: This book is and out-of-touch with reality. The author consistently uses he when referring to the executive level and she when referring to administrative assistants. She implies that women should be well-mannered and look nice at all times
1, streak free but drys out quickly: When i first got these wipes
1, outset qn70 grill wok: My wife and I belong to weight watchers. So we started grilling vegetables on the grill. This wok is perfect for grilling veggies along side of steaks
1," Woo hoo!: I first was exposed to The Mountain Goats in the form of their incredible ""The Monkey Song"" from Protein Source of the Future"
1, Reliable performance: I bought a generic brand car charger for my Samsung phone at the store where I bought my phone several months ago and always had problems fully charging my battery. I even had to replace my battery since it got damaged.This charger charges my battery in record time. The LED charge status indicator is great. The other one did not have the indication. Batteries are to expensive to take a chance.Great phone too!
1, This particular set of the John Denver Collection: This particual set of the John Denver Collection is the best one ever. Why? Because it's complete...having songs that other so-called complete collections do not have. The audio is first class
1, Sweeping and uplifting: Beautifully textured music that blends the best of Eastern and Western instruments. At once serene and energetic
1, Vietnam and America in Poetry: This book in poetry form is written by two women - - one is Vietnamese and the other is American who was in Vietnam as the wife of a news correspondent. The tales are of the confrontations
1, Makes more sense if you've been to graduate school...: Don't be too hard on this episode. It's definitely a throwback to an earlier type of Sci-Fi -- Forbidden Planet and its ilk
1, Serves its pupose well: This holds our Maclaren Techno XT without issue. There is extra room in the bag should you need it. It also holds my Graco Pack n Play just fine. We travel a lot so when we bring the Pack n Play we also bring an extra mattress
1, Good Bag: I really like this bag. It fits my Combi single stroller well without having to remove the wheels. There is plenty of extra room inside it to put in a rain cover or something like that. With where the zipper is located
0, Poor Reproduction: The photo reproduced quality is so low
0, Horrible reproduction ruins the original book!: This reproduction is an insult to the careful scholarship of Lorrin Andrews
1, Outstanding: Barbra Streisand makes anyone she sings with sound like gold. Which is exactly what her voice is liquid gold.
1, What Kind of Fools...: would revisit
0, Not a duet album: I was highly disappointed that Mr. Gibb only sang some back-up occasionally through the album. This is not a duet album as the cover may lead you to believe.
1, Better than Guilty - A great CD for Barbra: This CD is
0, Sorry... but all those 5 stars are just ridiculous: Think every die hard Barbra fan knows this is Not a great album and trying to safe what can only be discribed this total dissaster of an album.I am a Barbra fan since a star is born... loved the song prisoner (eyes of laura mars) to death
0, Forget It: There is so many beautiful compositions out there-- why does Streisand pick such losers. Her voice is incredible-- she needs incredible material
0, Only a diehard Streisand fan...: I was once a diehard Streisand fan and would find something to love about her work no matter how bad it was. While I agree that Barbra is still in fine voice
0, Toss It: I bought this Streisand joke of a CD & threw it in the trash. Anyone who likes good music will do the same.Save your money--total garbage.
1, Great Mysteries: I like the characters in the Dismas Hardy series. The stories are always great and keep me turning the pages to the end.
1, Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies: Excellent identification book for beginners. Simple information concepts and good location maps with each dragonfly picture.
1, Good Movie: I've always liked this movie and I like the concept of James Stewart being a sheriff that doesn't want to use a gun in the wild west.
1, emotionally satisfying medieval: This is Helen Kirkman's debut novel and is well worth checking out. Kirkman knows her medieval/Dark Ages history (she's an Englishwoman from Chesire) but doesn't make too many allowances for those who might not. It's not that hard to follow what is happening but a quick glimpse at a history of the times might help with the political situation and customs of the day.The book is more a character driven story and to be honest
0, Uncomfortable to wear and not very cold: I have two issues with this product:1) Uncomfortable - poor design has extra velcro (not used to hold the collar on you) poking out and scratching at your throat.2) Doesn't absorb the cold very well - a can of Coca Cola in the refrigerator for 20 minutes is way colder than this pack is after sitting overnight in a chest 'deep freeze' freezer.A cold wash rag wrapped around your neck and covered with a towel would be just about as effective
1, Better quality than I expected: I use it for cold therapy only. It is of superior quality
1, Nice but not excellent: It is a good product but for the cost I can get the same results from a heating pad and have heat for longer periods of time. However
1, great!!!: I bought this for my grandmother so she doesnt have to try to hold a ice pack
1, Fits very nicely
0, wrong item: So this Mueller shoulder therapy was not what I originally ordered. I ordered the Elasto-gel cervical collar. I was sent this Mueller SHOULDER cold/hot therapy......even though returned (twice
0, Too heavy and doesn't stay cool very long: The weight of this pack is too much for me to stand keeping it on my neck when it is sore and the strap is very scratchy and uncomfortable. Even after being in the freezer for more than a day it didn't stay cool very long. It also has the strangest smell. I regret purchasing this item.
0, ok...could be better: frozen overnite & when taken out of freezer
0, Not a 100 count humidor!: I was a bit surprised to see how small this humidor is compared to the size it's advertised at. I was able to fit 60 cigars into this box. And not 60 churchills
0, Outdated by Wikipedia: In 1999
0, Stellar cast in eclipse: I had high hopes for this one based on the cast and storyline. Although the cast consists of high power A listers who we have all loved in other efforts and the premise of this movie was intriguing
0, Fallen Down: How can a movie made in that hip city of Philadelphia not have at least a little something going for it? Here's how: Copycat killings lead the baffled Detective Hobbes (Denzel) to figure that something of the supernatural variety is hexing and vexing him. Despite hooking up with a theology prof (Embeth Davidtz)
1, Hooker delivers basic blues-raw: This CD is raw basic blues delivered with John Lee's complicated guitar strokes and rythms. His use of silence leaves you hanging on the edge of your foot tap. The raw gritty sound of the revisited Jesse James cut gives this song an additional dark side. Bottle Up and Go has you dancing in your seat from the snappy acoustic begining. Boogie on Russian Hill inspires a house party. I highly recommend this album to anyone interested in getting to know Hooker's music and it is a must for a fan.
1, Ok
0, Don't Waste Your Money!: The tension on this bike is not dependable. Mine suddenly became so tight it's nearly impossible to pedal at all! The company doesn't even honor warranty promises. Though they offer email support
0, What Hapend?: Ok
1, Classic Comedy: Mama's Family {NBC 1983-1986} 60 eps {CBS 1986-1990} 70 eps southern sit-com about an old lady with her no-good relatives. Big hit for Vicky Lawrence & a just reward
1, suzieq: This video brings back the glory days of sitcoms. Great comedians- Carol Burnett
0, Good to know...: ...So Mama's Family is a cheap substitute? - I hate it when they change something so they can show you more commercials and then want to sell it to you as the real thing - thanks to everyone for pointing that out - I know that the streaming version of Married with Children doesn't even use the real opening theme - thanks to the internet you can find out it it's a bootleg copy.
0, irritating: Nothing against the seller
0, DON't BUY: Their customer service is terrible. The boards are unstable and getting them replaced costs you money. They used to make really great products but Personally I will never deal with this company again. If you want to sign up for a lot of headache go ahead
1, Best running shorts!: These are the best running shorts - for my long runs (over 5 miles) I only wear these. They breathe well and wick away moisture
0, NICE IMAGES: If you're looking to buy film panoramic camera
0, Video: Video quality extremely poor. I would go as far as saying it is a bootleg copy - grainy
0, Good film wasted on a lousy DVD transfer: One of the best made-for-TV mysteries from the writing teamWilliams & Link
1, Hilarious and poignant!: This book is hilarious and poignant. Lorne is surely set to become the next P.J. ORourke!

1, another touching grand opus from a great director who continues to get better: almodovar glorifies women! remarkable in its refusal to patronize
1, Todo Sobre Mi Corazón
1, Great Music: Great collection of cheerful tones influenced by the orient. Listening to them remindes me of being in a friendly Chinese village of long ago.
1, A Curious review: Burt Reynolds was his old self
0, For Demi Moore's eyes only!: The story of this movie is not much at all... actually it is weak and I knew this even before I buy this DVD.But what made it worth buying is to see Demi Moore strip for you... that's it!So if you are a fan of Demi Moore and want to see her strip for you... go for it. If not
1, Excellent Product: Love this stuff. Quick and easy to use when adding water. I order in bulk to save money. I have an 800 gallon pond.
1," ""Like peanut butter"": While most of this album has escaped my memory over the years"
1, Great book
1, Beautiful
1, Dog food container: This container came exactly as ordered and holds more than I thought it would; it doesn't take up a lot of space. So far
0, Dimmer switch: I would not recommend this product. After 6 months the dimmer doesnot work. The light stays on bright all the time.

1, My favorite poet: I'm not sure what the other reader was reading
0, Worst in the series: i got very wrapped up in the Anita Blake series. i couldn't get enough of it. But things started to go south (literally) in the later books and finally
0," Major disappointment in this series: I was hooked from the first line of ""Guilty Pleasures."" Here was a strong"
0, WAY TOO MUCH SEX - and not enough real plot: I have read and loved all of Laurell Hamilton's books - until this one. At least in the other books there was more than just sex going on and you could skip the sex parts and not feel cheated out of your money. If you tried to skip the sex parts in this book
0," Anita Loses Her ""Cool""!: In the latest of the Anita Blake series"
0, Shame Shame Laurell: I can only concur with previously reviews that summed Incubus Dreams in one word. SUCKS! Laurell did a disservice to her loyal readers on so many levels it's unbelievable. And to many to mention here except that she must be having a lot of sex herself or none at all to write at such ridiculous lengths. I would have been better off to just buy a cheap dollar-fifty porn novel. Shame
0, What the heck happened?: I usually like the Anita Blake series but what the heck is up with all the porn? I'm freaking 200 pages into it and the murder has not even been touched upon. But AB can have a female ej. Yaaaay! WTF. What the heck happened to this series...it's become a total waste of time.
0, Please LKH!: If you can't rejuvenate Anita back to her former glory
0, Worst book ever: I was a huge fan of Laurell Hamilton
0, WOW (in a bad way): First off
1, LOVED IT!!!: this book was awesome!!! i love the different plot lines and all the characters that are introduced!! WOO HOOOOOOOOO!!!!I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!!
0, A very long typo?: Incubus Dreams was a long book and it felt even longer. I can barley remember the plot one hour after I finished it
0, A Stinker: The first Anita Blake Vampire Hunter novels were good fun: they offered a somewhat unique farrago of sex
0," SOoooo disappointing: I like so many here have been a die hard fan since Guilty Pleasures and have ""stuck"" with it through all the new books despite their declining quality. This book is just another in the past 3-4 where her once great plots get lost in pages upon pages of repetitive porn. Even the vocabulary she uses to describe these ""erotica"" scenes is recycled. She has reduced once complex male figures into 2-dimensional (or less) adoring sex slaves or sulky child figures.Her main character Anita Blake has gone from a commanding/feisty ""do it herself"" woman to an over-sexed drama queen. Hamilton really seems to be dragging Anita down in more than plot"
0, So dissapointed!!: I was very much anticipating the next book after Cerulean Sins. I couldn't wait to see the conclusions of the story lines left hanging. I was sad to see that none of them were addressed in this book. Don't get me wrong
0, What happend to this series?????: I thought Guilty Pleasures was a fantastic book. I loved it!!! I continued on with the Anita Blake series and now it's turned into PORN!!! I'm on page 320 and have no idea what the hell this book is about!!! There is nothing but the ardeur. Ardeur with anything that moves!!! I'm giving up. It's such a shame that such an imaginative writer with such great characters has turned into this MESS!!! Typos all over the place. Grammatical errors. Laurell does not care about these characters anymore and neither do I. Huge waste of time and money.
1, One of the best in series: This is one of the best Anita Blake novels in the series. True fans of Anital Blake will really enjoy this book because there is finally growth in the main character. There is resolution in the many realtionships that have been forming in the previous novels. I can't wait for Anita Blake # 13.
1, hhmmm: ok this book had a lot more sex then any other of Anita books but damn it was good! I dont know about anyone else but it's good to see Nathanial be dominant!
0, Two and a Half Stars...: It would be interesting to divide the book up and compare how much of the book is spent having sex vs. how much on the actual plot? The plot itself is introduced but never followed through. So many story lines are left hanging in the air
0, Returning my book: I am returning this book...The jacket cover an all of the advertisements suggested that Anita was finally up against the ulitmate evil... A serial killer that is a vampire and that preys on strippers.Well
0, More Sue than Q: I didn't believe it could happen
0," LKH Surrounded by ""Yes"" People Now?: I am a long-time Anita Blake series fan until Incubus Dreams. While the two prior to this had aspects that I didn't like -- they had enough I liked and of the characters I loved to keep going.Either LKH is now surrounded by ""yes"" people because of her success and/or she was in some sort of war with her publisher and on purpose wrote this piece of junk.How can she let her Anita fans down like this? I'm still dreaming that she will announce that Incubus Dreams was a mistake and write the great Anita Blake series book that we all deserve.Frankily if she would drop her Gentry series (way too much romance for my liking) perhaps she could then focus on a good Anita book."
0, Am I really saying too much sex?: Yes.....Sloppy writing
1, Not the typical Anita Blake...: but I enjoyed it. The sex did get repetitive and I did want to read more action and [...] kicking
0, Hope the next one is better: Okay
0, Oh
0, Just Adding My One Star: Don't waste your time or your money. If you want to read something

0, Doesn't Even Come Close to UNCUT: This is my favorite show in japanese. Ive seen all 200episodes uncut. I love magical girl series.
0," Marshalls Creek Sage: The quality of Marshalls Creeks Sage is less than ideal. The ""sealed"" container is not really ""sealed at all"" I had spider webs and mold (somehow) in some other herbs I purchased from them. I personally wouldn't recommend this product."

0, Chafes My Arse: Girl (they never introduce themselves to each other -- ha ha

1, Delicious and Beautiful: I absolutely love this cookbook. Every single recipe I have tried is delicious
1, Memories: I absolutely love this CD! I have been searching for years to get this album. It brings back so many wonderful memories. I gave it this rating because it is one of my favorite albums rom the '80s!
0, Warning you may receive wrong CD: This CD is listed as being by Madame X the R&B girl group. What you get is a CD by some rock group of same name
0, Simply sophisticated yet unique: Unlike the fun but trendy faceplates this earth theme color has a distinctive look that also compliments any style. Because it is in neutral tones

1, Very Emotionaly Book: This was a 5 star book. It was very emotionaly for me
1, Crash tests are over!: These guys really put the pedal to the metal. The sounds of the days when a great little cheek was only a peck away. I remeber the INCIDENT ON THE 10th FLOOR like it was yesterday! What about the PENETRATION? Well IN TRANSIT
1, Little Fox Goes to the End of the World: Little Fox is tired of having to play in the same area day after day. She wants to travel to the end of the world. When her mother asks about the end of the world
1, A perpetual exercise in doubting 'the facts'; great mystery: The narration and elaborate descirptions in this book lure the reader in more and more. You cannot let one single aspect of the narration escape you
0, Grade F-: This movie was so bad I could not watch the whole thing.THE GOODNothing
1, beautiful psychedelia: Beautiful psychadelic vision of american life in the 70's. Drifting along in a dreamlike trance while taking in the beauty
1, Cute lights!!!: My husband and in-laws love to fish
0," ""Kill your darlings"" (Spoilers within): I have always been a huge RAS fan. But when this series ended and Breunor was on his deathbed"
0, Terrible Ending to the Series: Absolutely horrible ending to this series which wasn't very good to begin with.There was a time when RAS used to be one of the most enthralling writers in the Fantasy genre. Now he's become stale
0, Uninspired followup: Let me preface this review by saying that several of RA Salvatore's works have been some of the best books I've ever read. So it's hard to see him produce such an uninspired work that could have been written for a freshman creative writing course. The beautiful imagery and rich character development that are such a trademark of his novels and makes them so entertaining is completely absent in the Two Swords. Even his beautifully narrated fight scenes have regressed into mind numbing hack-and-slash. It seems like it was written simply to fulfill a contractual obligation. Frankly I'd rather send him $25 and not have him write something like this.
0, Uncomfortable: This chair is really uncomfortable. I tried to get used to it for two months
1, Nice product. Good quality ingredients.: This is a nice mix for any medium or large bird. Looks good enough for us humans to snack on. Unfortunately I can't get my Cockatoo to eat anything except pellets or what we are having for dinner. He just won't eat any nuts
1, Not too bad: This is an alright movie. It's a psychological thriller in the highest - that is
1, Are you a 'Taker'?: This movie is excellent. A man finally realizes that we are the ones that are wrong and savage
0, Hopkins and Gooding Jr. make the film watchable: Instinct is basically every good thriller you ever saw mashed into one movie and given a philosophical message. The message is that humanity needs to stop what he is doing and get back to being one with nature. Yeah
1, Incredible Performances: Hopkins and Gooding give what is quite possibly the most impressive performance
1, Wonderful stuff!: This CD is a family favorite we have nearly worn it out! It is a great one to have playing during dinner.
1, Pardon the puns....: This movie would be a great item in a time capsule from the '60s. The hair
0, VInyl Backing: I will be returning this pad unused
1, Best waterproof sheet protector EVER!: I purchased this pad in September 2010 for my father
1, Really Works!: This waterproof sheet protector really protects bedsheet from wetness. I need it to protect the sheets on my Mother's bed during the night. It keeps her sheet dry if she has an accident and because it is so large
1, Excellent: Does a great job and it covers much of the area my husband needs. It is a life saver. Not much more can be said except it works.
0, It shifts around: This pad moves around a lot. It does not stay in place and that is a problem if you want to use it on top of your sheets.
0, Sheet protector leaked through - does NOT protect: Item arrived promptly. Contained odd warning about not using with children
1, great floor protector.: In the country I put this down just inside the back door when the men and children are coming in with dirty shoes. It absorbs liguid very well and is easy to shake out and wash.
1, Excellent Interactive Books: I have now purchased all of the books in this line for my 2 yr old son & they are all wonderful!! I have a vast book collection for my son & these are by far the most interactive!! Superbly done

0, CRAPPY: This book was so boring i fell asleep every other pagealso there are other good historical fiction books out thereand ones about the civil war or w/ethis book is so incredibly tedious that if i had to read it in one sitting i would diedo not make your students read this they will try their best to skip reading itbelieve me my class was forced to do a literary curve and everybody went online and cheated because they read most of the book and found it so boringplease have a heart
0, Are We Reading the Same Book?: ...Before I read it
0, BAD BAD BOOK!!!!!!: This is one book I could live without. Johnny was an irresponsible brat. I liked it when Pumpkin died. I think the best part was the Boston Tea Party. Cilla and Isannah were by far the worst characters in the book. For your sake don't read the book. Please listen to me.
0, NOT a must-read: While both my parents and my parent's friends are always raving about this book
1, good historical fiction: Would've been great to read this book while learning about the Revolutionary War as a kid. Makes it come alive. Instead
0, The DTS track is not worth it: WARNING
0, Its not good.: This is only good if you are absolutly desperate. The monitor you hook it up to will not show color and it constantly has a darker bar running down it. There is no sound at all so thats of no use.

0, SUBLIME: BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BOYFRIEND I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK. IT LOOKS WORN IM SURE ITS THE STYLE BUT I DIDNT LIKE IT. THE KOI AND THE GRAFFITI WRITING IS COOL AND IT HAS LITTLE BUD LEAVES INSIDE THE HOOD I WAS JUST THROWN OFF BY THE WASH...IF IT LOOKED LIKE A NEW SWEATER IT COULD HAVE BEEN COOL.
0," ""Talking Caller ID"" doesn't talk the Caller ID: Even though ""Talking Caller ID"" is printed right on the unit"
0, Kindle Premium: Why do we pay for our Kindle and then get charged a 35% premium over the price of the print version of this book? Someone needs to get a clue here. I would love to read this book on my Kindle but refuse to pay more for it.
1, QBQ should be required reading for those who want to succeed: Easy read. Less than an hour.One of the greatest books on personal accountability I've ever read. I have made it required reading for the staff and lay leadership at my church. And also for my teenage children!Recommend for anyone who wants to be the person who stands out postively within organizations where layoffs are on the horizon.
1, Doesn't Beat Around The Bush: This book can be read in one sitting easily and gets right to the point. If you were ever wondering why others act the way you do
1, Little book
1, QBQ (the Question Behind the Question): This is a short
0, it ain't worth it: This is an entirely overrated publication. There is plenty of warm and fuzzy but the recommendations could have been written by a middle school student after an hour (of less) of one-on-one conversation.
0, The motive behind the QBQ: The book reads easily
0," not too bad but i've read better: the beginning of the book is boring until you get to the middle were it gets a better but not much the ending wasn't as clever as Agatha Christie is known for but the alibi's for all the characters are cool. the detectiveHercule Poirot isn't close to being as good as Sherlock Holmes. This is a letdown compared to ""And then there were none"" but agatha is still cool but if i was you i wouldn't read this instead of reading stuff by Bernard Cornwell or other books by The Queen of Crime!"
1, Spellbinding Mystery: I really enjoyed reading this book. Agatha Christie does a wonderful job of weaving together clues
1, excellent control: This is an excellent control
1, Beautiful movie-not for little ones: Oh how Disney movies have taken over our home! I love it. This one is so beautiful
0, National Geographic Little Kids: I am really disappointed and I haven't even reviewed the content. First
0," Worked well for 15 minutes...: Bought this to install porch screens and wooden screen molding. Plastic case opened at the seam which disabled the attached steel staple channel and driver. This stapler broke after firing fewer than two dozen 1/4"" staples! Never got a chance to see if the brad nailer would have worked to install the screen molding. Selected this unit because my Surebonder manual stapler has worked so well."
0, surebonder 5900: I purchased this product because it is capable of using brads and pins as well as staples. However

1," Thank Goodness For Melvins: In a time where ""Alternative Music"" is nothing more than a big"
0, doesn't rock very hard: a lot of self-indulgent syntho blips and squeaks instead of guitars
0, Great Necklace!: Very nice peridot necklace. I bought the 3-piece set for a birthday gift
0, Not impressed: A picture of the whole plant would be more helpful. To me
1," Hagen Exo Terra Silk Ficus: Im not much for fake plants but wanted to ""decorate"" my snake tank so I bought some of these.They look pretty good and my snake loves climbing through them.The suction cup holds pretty well as my snake (aboout 2 feet long) hasnt knocked them down at all.I also bought the Ruscus plantsHagen Exo Terra Silk Terrarium Plant"
0, Save your Money: I am a man of few words.....this is a worthless piece of trite tripe. Once again Keanu Reeves proves he has the acting ability of a pear. This is a hackneyed plot....another serial killer pseudosuspense. Nowhere near the quality of Sea of Love.
1, thriller: This is an excellent thriller movie. Enjoyed it very much. Great performances by Keanu Reeves and James Spader and Marisa Tomei
1, An original thriller!: Unusual story about a serial killer who constructs methodically with explicit detail every one of his murderers: He chooses lonely woman and sends photographs hours before to commit the crime.James Spader looks very convincing but Keanu Reeves was not at his best level.The final sequence presents a visible fault in what special effects concern.Nevertheless the film gets its aim.
1, husband love them: He works long hours on his feet 
1, Comfortable: This is my second pair. I need the support of a boot but something light weight. These are the best boots that I have found and they are extremely comfortable.
1, One of the greatest tales of tragic adventure ever lived: An amazing story of an innocent man's journey from the underworld of France to the underbelly of the penal colony of French Guiana in 1931. The movie
0, Not for me: I always find it a bit unsettling when I don't enjoy a book everyone raves about. My problem with Papillon was twofold. A lot of people compared it to Shantaram when recommending it to me. Gregory David Roberts created such vivid characters
1, Greatest novel I've ever read: M. Cherrière managed to capture courage
1," What An Incredible Storyteller!: This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. I've read it a few times and always find it fascinating. Whether all of these stories of Henri Charriere (""Papillon"") are true"
1, Brought back Memories: I first became deeply interested in Papillion when I became a regular visitor to French Guiana
0, Lame movie: Huge waste of money... Bad acting and one of the main character doesn't even speak in the whole movie.Justin
0, Misleading Details: Avoid this compilation of Telephone
1, A must read for everyone.: I read this book years ago & loved it then as I do now.I've even given 3 of them away. I can't tell you how it can change your life for the positive. Take my word for it
1, nine o clock in the morning: I would recommend this to any person who are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit.We need more men like Dennis Benneth to turn the world upside down.
0, Complete Works
0," Mouth To Mouth: ""Mouth To Mouth"" is a contrived movie. The script written by some one taking Ritilan or some drug used for Adult Attention Disorder. The story ambles in several lost directions. Of course"

Then when I had issues with it not recognizing a DVD I whent on the network and downloaded a firmware upadate. This then killed all my HD capacity and now I only have regular dvd playback. Toshiba support said wait for another firmware update to see if it could fix it but did not say when probably a few months or more. Oh how I wasted $500 on this junk!
0, Stay away!: HD DVD is a dead format! Warner Brothers is going to stop producing HD DVD discs soon. Do a search and you will see many articles about this. The only studios that will be making HD DVD's are Paramount/Dreamworks and Universal. Disney

0, Roland Emmerich is the worst film-maker of all times!: Stargate
1, Will Smith Flies High: This movie is an excellent vehicle for special effects and Will Smith-style comedic heroism. It is a good blend of action and science fiction with enough humor thrown in to keep it entertaining after many viewings.The story is fairly simple; the outcome predictable. Still
0, Get the 5-star edition and be done with it...: The 5-star edition is the dvd to have if you want to own ID4. It is a 2 disc release that is packed with special features including the extended version of the movie.
0, An Obvious Crowd-Pleaser: I saw this piece of work in the theaters
0," Please Stop Giving This Man Money: People say ""Don't take this film too seriously"" - like it's meant to be a comedy. The only funny thing about this movie is how bad it is. Bad characters (is it possible to have less than 1 dimension?). Stupid plot. Excrable dialog. Totally unoriginal design. Perhaps the worst movie since Emmerich's last one (the equally idiotic ""StarGate""). He just keeps coming back for helping after helping of stale cliche. After writing this he must have still had the other side of the cigarette paper left for ""Godzilla"".Big explosions. That's all. They may as well have called it ""Things Exploding"" - at least no-one would have felt shortchanged.Tip for future civilisations: Build cities out of palm trees. They seem to survive anything."

0, what a brainless movie!: this is an ok movie

0," ID4=WHAT WERE WE THINKING?: It's truly amazing to look at this ""film"" now and marvel that it's one of the top grossing motion pictures of all time. Basically"
1, Thank you.: It took a little time to get to me but otherwise very pleased. Very happy that it was in great condition. Great sci-fi action film. Will smith is great and the aliens are gross. Thank you do much
1, Not great lit.
1, Introduction to Emergency Management: An excellent introductory book with a good review of the basic components of emergency management
0, Waste of money: I am a lightweight backpacker but I found this book useless.It appeared to be based on little experience and even less research.I could learn more from reading a catalog.
0, DAXTER: i PERSONALLY THOUGHT THAT DAXTER WAS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DOESENT HAVE A VERY GOOD STORY LINE AND IT'S REALLY

1," The right tool for the job!: This shovel is exactly what I was looking for. With this shovel you simply push the snow just like a snow plow truck. The 27"" on this shovel assists in finishing the job quickly. Others have mentioned that they prefer to have a metal shovel. I'd have to say that I would rather replace a shovel every 5 to 10 years than destoy my walkway"
0, Too Loose to Be Effective: The materials and quality are good on this wetsuit but the neck line and chest area fit too loosely to adequately preserve warmth. After one use in cold water my legs were warm but my torso was as cold as it would have been with no suit.

1, Odd little film is wonderful: Static stars Keith Gordon (Christine
0, not a useful book: This book was disappointing. The presentation of biometrics was very shallow. I wanted to learn more detailed information about biometrics but the treatment in this book was very superficial.
1, Great game for the kids: Who says a game has to be ultra-violent to be good. Harvest Moon DS proves that you don't need flying splatters of blood
1, Get it!!: I love it!!! yeah it can take a while saving money to buy things and you have to have patience but thats the fun of the game! Its what keeps you going

1, Best Ever: To my curent knowledge this is the absolute best proggressive metal band ever. Now you might think I am overestimating the capabilities of these four virtuoso musicians
0, Very poorly sized: I ordered this shirt based on Columbia's reputation and style. I ordered a medium and it seemed like an extra large. It was so big that I'm not even sure that a small would fit me. What's with this? Can't Columbia get their sizing right? Is it that hard?
1, TOTALLY BRILLIANT!: Another winner from DiMercurio! This is his best novel yet of the ones I've read so far

0, Do you smell something?: You'll like this movie a lot if you're the kind of person who likes really dumb movies. However
1, Not as good as the original: When I saw this in theaters the weekend it opened
1, A slight departure from the original...: Sure
0, Let down: While it's not a particularly bad movie
0, scary for the wrong ressons: I will make this review short.This film is worse than battlefield(absolutely vile and abismal
0, A Bigger Budget Equals A Terrible Film: All the charm of the first film has been thrown out the window in favor a big budget Hollywood assembly line garbage.Complete with cheesy fast-motion flashes of people shaking their heads or bodies. It could have been a terrific movie
0, What the heck...: The movie was not the problem
1, Terribly Underrated; will play head games with you: This had to be one of the wierdest
0, why a sequel
0, Bad ending: This game is not bad for an older game. Not as good as other TR games. The biggest problem is that on the last level

0, Top 100 novels? Seriously?: I read one novel by John Le Carre before: Our Kind of Traitor
1, An upfront challenge for the brainy: I have chosen to read this book as it is listed by a world distinguished magazine among the best spy novels ever writtenThe plot is a challenge to the reader intelligence since one cannot predict the outcome until the last word on the last page
1, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold: I 1st read SPY when it came out in 1964. A few weeks earlier I had seen the 1st James Bond film. The SPY was such a relief
1, good quick read: the book was fantastic from start to finish. the story moves very quickly and isn't overly long. if you like other books like Our Man in Havana by Graham Greene
1, Not Free SF Reader: The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the story of a British Secret Service agent who leaves that organisation and basically defects to East Germany.What he does not realise for a while is that he is actually being manipulated by his former masters as they play a complicated game of espionage with other assets in place in his new home.
1, cross the line->fade to gray: The point is about who is the good guy and who is the bad? The Soviet success with atomic secrets started the cold war spy wars.In Mad Magazine there is spy versus spy; one wearing white and the other wearing black: in this caseit appears both are wearing gray.This plot is much better than the other novels I've read by this author ( and they were very good).Twist within turn within twist and the ultimate victim is an innocent!We are given a graphic picture of the cold war as an acultural waste land without conscience or ethics.
0, Not one of Hemingway's best: This book reminded me of a horrid ride that you couldn't get off. At first it was fun
1, To Have: I have finshed reading To Have and To Have Not by Ernest Hemingway. I'm 13 and extremmly advanced in reading. This book is extremly good and was written quite well. I would whole heartly recommend this book to any who wish to read it. But note that there is a lot of racism and men that are sexist. This book also tells of a smuggeling operation and has some violence.Hope to keep you informed
1, Nice Guide...add a few more pages and it would be perfect: This guide has all of the critical stuff you need as a renter of this type of aircraft. You have to be careful to make sure you are looking at the right charts though
1, Great Deal: After having expensive sheets that pilled and were just generally of a poor quality (Nautica brand
0, Garbage: Only useful for cleaning up the mess that dogs make inside the house. Flimsy

0, Missing pieces and poor construction: Like other reviewers
0, Falls apart and tips over too easily: This is a terrible toy for a child who is learning to pullup and walk! It is too light in the front
1, I would buy again: My daughter got this toy for Christmas right about the time she was starting to stand alone. I really do think it has helped her learn to walk. Although as soon as she could walk without it she lost interest in it. I do like that it has a wide base and is adjustable as far as speed. I think I would buy it again.
0, Disappointment: I bought this walker because it looked nice and sturdy for my 11-month-old
1, These are the best books: These set of books are the best i've ever read. Every book in the series is filled with at least three exiting journeys to always want to make you keep reading.Once you have read one you keep wanting to read more. One of the best things is the way he talks about the food or how each anmial has his own dalect. One of the few problems is that you cant put the book down. I hope Brian Jacques keeps writing more and more!
1, the wonderful world of redwall: This book is um... how do u say a tid bit off beat. It is about a warrior mouse
1, A Furry Adventure: This book is an interesting story about a young mouse [Matthias] defending his home [Redwall Abbey] against a hoard of rats who want to capture Redwall. Matthias must solve mysterious riddles
1, After I read this
1, Redwall: First of all let me say I quite enjoyed the book. If you are completely new to the Redwall series you should know that it is basically an epic tale about war between several types of animals. This is in every book in the Redwall Series!Now you shouldn't shun this book just because it deals with a slightly childish topic. All characters have a near human personality and either have your heartfelt compassion or solid dislike. Now I don't want to go into to much detail
1, one of my favorite books
1, Our family is now totally addicted to Redwall!: I originally ordered the first Redwall audio book out of curiosity. We love to listen to stories and books and had read so much about these books that the audio version immediately appealed to me. My oldest (10 1/2)
1, The Best Book Ever: Redwall is about a young mouse who lives in a fort with his fellow mice. When a rat and his army of rats challenge the fort
1, Redwall was a terriffic
0, A horrible book: I thought that this was a bad book because i think it was very boring and it only made sense towards the end. So that book was the worst book that I have ever read in my life. I think it kept saying the same thing over and over. There was one good part in that book it was the last page when the action finally got started. So I would not recommend this book unless you like mice killing books.
1, Great book!: My dad read this book to me and I thought it was great. It kept my interest through the whole book. Since I am in the third grade I think it would be good for kids my age to adults. --Mason
1, GREAT!: Redwall is a great book
1, Children's book with crossover appeal: My son read this book as a reading assignment at school and I thought the cover looked interesting so I gave it a try. I was quickly caught up in the captivating story that was presented. Would highly recommend to both children and adult readers alike!
0, DO NOT EXPECT Groove Theory II: This album is mediocre at best. It seems to draw comparisons to Sade but Sade is Sade and Amel should be Amel. Amel and Bryce were a great team and the tracks that Bryce laid down in Groove Theory's debut with Amel's voice were phenomenal. Bryce's beats are sorely missed in Amel's solo effort. I was hoping for a reunion for at least a track or two but no luck. So don't make the same mistake I did and expect Groove Theory II. Amel's voice is indeed a beautiful one but the lack of musical direction is a fatal flaw. The music is just a meandering flow from one track to the other; not one standout track on here. Groove Theory was/is one of my favorite CD's and this one doesn't compare. I know this is Amel's CD and not Groove Theory but I expected so much more. You won't be bobbin' yo' head to this one
1, The return of Amel Larrieux: The Groove Theory album has been one of my all-time favorites
0, Great Movie-Why aren't there english subtitles! -DVD review: Spanish is my native tongue
1, Historical account of great English king: As a history teacher
1, Shakespeare for guys: Branagh's interpretation of Henry V is absolutley electrifying and as close to an action film as Shakespeare gets. This is one of my favorite films of all time (I've seen it a dozen times) and never fails to delight and amaze me. Like all shakespeare
1, An Insightful Interpretation: I find it amazing that two film makers could produce two such different works based on the same source
1, Learn to love Shakespeare.: It's hard to believe that this is Branagh's first screenwriting and directing effort. Either one would be an immense task
0, Disappointing!: This work is a strange hybrid between a filmed theatrical performance and a full-fledged movie production. Many scenes are just static and stage-like. Others
0, I Don't Get It: Sorry folks. The guy is dead I know. I read all the reviews thinking this was going to be one to add to the CD collection.. and I was truly disappointed. I appreciate great ballads
0, Overdone: Gratuitous and specious are words that come to mind while parsing this album. The only worthwhile song was written by L. Cohen (Hallelujah)
1, Poetry...: A friend recommended this to me. Never really listened to Jeff Buckley before
1, Rubbish.... is it?: At first listen
1, The Best I've Ever Heard..and I've been around!: What a phenomenal album---every song in the album is excellent. How many contemporary albums can you say this about?! His work is full of so much emotion. What an excellent voice and what excellent guitar. This album will accompany me through life.
0, Don't believe the hype - 1.5 stars
0, don't listen to the reviews: If sickly sweet is your thing then buy this album. But don't listen to me or the others
1, eclectic and haunting proformance: JB's unique voice
0, Atrocious: Only one word can describe this album-- Atrocious. Jeff Buckley?? Ha--more like Jeff Suckley.
1, Yikes!: I just bought these reels at Walmart for $3.54. I understand Walmart can offer lower prices but the difference is insane and that's before the charge for shipping from this company. Great toy

1," It's the end of something simple....: Remember those lines? I know I do. ""Dawson's Creek"" first aired on the WB in 1998 when I was 13"
1, Begining of the end: This was by far the best season of Dawson's Creek. AFter season 1 the series got worse and worse as every season went by. Capture the best season fo Dawson's Creek on DVD.
0, GARBAGE: I bought two of these from Office Depot because it was on sale for so cheap. Biggest mistake I've ever made. I used one for my apartment and gave one to my sister to use
1, Best Printer I've Ever Owned!!: I've had this printer for 4 months and it's Awesome! It prints pictures BETTER than walgreens and rite-aid! Color and Black & White is crisp and clean!For the reviewers that have commented the pictures could be better perhaps its yor camera! We have a 10mega pixel camera and I can print nice big pictures
0," HORRIBLE: This is the worst printer I have ever used. I am a college student and need to print things everyday and this printer is useless. I have to go to the library because it is always ""jammed"". The cartiges that I first bought were almost instantly indicated as empty and every other print job results in a jam. The buttons are confusing and useless as they do not solve the issue. I am currently giving up on this because it thinks it is jammed but there is nothing in the machine!"
0, Loss Leader: When Gilette invented the safety razor in 1902 he practically gave them away. This was because he knew he would make much more money selling the blades. The tactic was called a loss leader. That's what Canon is doing with this printer. The ink is very expensive and produces fewer prints than any other printer I have ever owned by far. My printer is still working well but I'm throwing away this otherwise OK machine because I can't afford to feed it.
1, Solid Printer for the Price: I bought this printer in 2008 and am still using it in late 2010. It has almost all the features I wanted
0, Not worth the money spent.: I purchased the Franklin MWD-450 because my old Franklin (jumble & crossword assistant) was stolen. I was told by Long Drugs that this Franklin MWD-450 was better than my old model. WRONG. It was worse than the old model. There isn't any jumble in the model. One of my old STAR crossword puzzles on my old model aided me on 87 words. The MWD-450 came up with only 33 words. This model maybe good on small words but overall I would rate this model much less than ONE star. I would suggest all buyers purchase a different model from another company that is made in America
1, Fascinating: I remember my mother reading this book to the family when I was a child so when I found it in the bookstore I had to pick it up.I found the book interesting and the Amish a fascinating group of people. The book tells about the Amish and about growing up Amish. The Amish live a totally different type of lifestyle than most of us are used to and this book explains some of their reasons for why that is. In living close to them I was able to compare what the book said with what I saw them doing.If you ever find this book I recommend reading it.
0, BLUEPRINT FOR GENOCIDE: Hitler was as good as his word. One of the few politicians who did exactly what he planned to do
1, Good to read..: I've always been interested in reading Mein Kampf but couldn't find an English copy that suited me as far as appearance goes. It's terrible to find a copy in English only to find a massive prologue and an entire back cover paragraph telling the reader how horrible Germans are and that everything Hitler ever did was bad.From reading thus far I've found that the man was very
0," The worst Ravenloft book in the series...: I've read the majority of this series and this one is by far the worst. It's painfully obvious that Laurell K. Hamilton has never played D&D and has little to no idea how Ravenloft has been portrayed by her fellow authors. The first Ravenloft book that I read concerning Harkon Lukas was ""Heart of Midnight"
0, What Happened?: I read all of her other books so far but what happened here? I was sorely disappointed. This was not only a truly depressing read but nothing was resolved and it felt incomplete.
0, Not so hot: The premise is intriguing
1, a classic must read: Lassie come home illustrates not only the loyalty of the collie
1, Wonderful: This was my first time ordering all of my books online for my college classes. I was a bit hesitant not being able to see the books before I purchased them
1," It saved my dog's life!: ""The Well Adjusted Dog"" is a wonderful book that taught me how to fix my dog with a few easy movements. My dog now can walk again and never goes on the floor! Thank-you DR. Kamen!"
1, Kemalism
1, thriller: Think Hitchcock
0, Dawson's Creek: Season Two: You should never change the music on a show! Especially Dawson's Creek where the music was part of the show and not just background. This DVD is appalling! Though the shows are technically the same
1, Thee Best Season By Far!!!!: This DVD will be under my Christmas tree from myself hehe. Undoubtedly the best season ever. So much happens and so many surprises! I didn't know they let Kevin Williamson go after this season and it definitely shows in the later seasons but still one of my favorite shows. Bringing back past characters and bringing in new ones was an excellent idea and done very well. The last episode is a shocker I thought and will leave you begging for season 3 to come out.
1, A Great Season for a Great Show: yes yes and more yes the BEST season of Dawsons Creek ever the impact it had on me dont get me started! Jack and Andie move to capeside Jen makes Friends with Abby and yes Roswells main star Jason Behr makes many apperances! If you thought Season One would be the best season of them all think again. This is by far the best season of Dawsons Creek ever! This is a must have for every Dawsons Creek fan and basically every dvd collecter and whats great is its out just before christmas meaning its a great christmas idea!
0, Sooooo angry...: Season two was definitely the best season
1, Amazing!: I love this dvd!! There's even love for us Pacey Joey fans!!!! I recommend this
1, Great Movie: Really enjoyed this movie. I had seen it a number of times in the past and wanted to purchase it. Good performances by Pacino and Cusack. Great drama.
1, Excellent!: This is by far the best cookbook I own. I have had it for a year now
0, Not easy off Label Off: First
1, Wine lover and Label Off enthusiast: I found label off in a winery in Sonoma. I peeled off three labels in 10 minutes with no trouble and am looking forward to building my collection of labels. Unfortunately I can't find anyone who carries Label Off anymore. When I do I will not hesitate to buy them. The secret to Label Off is not only pressure
1, Pushing Tin was great!: If you are looking for a different movie
0, Not a great Cusack movie :/: I've been a John Cusack fan since I was a kid and this movie is not his best
0, Very missleadingly named cable.: I finally realize why they don't include this with the pro sling box. Because the value it adds is practically 0.The resulting picture is actually worse than the component output. I have an HD cable box that outputs converted signals and downsampled picture was actually better than the straight resampled HD signal that this cable outputs.The picture is small and it is not noticably better than the component output. In hindsight the pro box is really not necessary since the HD cable does not add its advertised value.
0, IT AIN'T PRETTY ARTISAN!: ARTISAN loves to put out lousy substandard dvds and apparantly they think no one either notices or cares. Let's see...SLEEPLESS by DARIO ARGENTO...and this great movie JOHNNY HANDSOME which I WON'T BE BUYING until they put out a decent version. I was gonna buy this today as a matter of fact and immediately put it back when I saw it was full-screen. YAWN...wake up ARTISAN...please!!
0," Not the entire solos!: Just based on what the ""look inside"" feature displays"
1, Different cover than shown: I really like this book
1, Must Read!: Do not be fooled by the movie. the movie should not even be named Ella Enchanted. This book has romance
1, I loved it!: I thought this book was wonderful! I couldn't put it down for one second
1, This book is a thrilling fairytale: Ella Enchanted is a story of a girl named Ella who is given the gift of obedience by a foolish fairy named Lucinda. To Ella the gift is a curse. When she and the prince fall in love and her evil stepsister Hattie orders her not to see the prince the gift is a curse. When Ella makes a new friend and is ordered not to have a friendship with her she hates the curse. When ogers catch her and order her not to go anywhere they almost eat her. The curse could have killed her! The curse is especially horrid when Ella is ordered to give Hattie the necklace she got when her mother passed away. This is a story of love
1," Enchanted with ""Ella Enchanted"": Enchanted with ""Ella Enchanted""""Ella enchanted"" is a great book. You should read it if your interested in fantasy!The book ""Ella enchanted"" is about a girl who was born and Lucinda (fairy god mother)bestows a gift upon her. in the middle of the book something happens to Ella and her mom unfortunately Ella's mom dies. Ella also falls in love to this prince but the prince doesn't really like her until he realizes that she is great and they end up marring each other.This book is also great because it has good words"
1, Enchantingly Spectacular: Ella Enchanted is an awesome book! I thought that Gail did an amazing job in mixing romance and action. I couldn't put down this book! Gail took fairy tales to a new level. The only thing i didn't like about the book was that in the end it was a little too much like Cinderella
1, Fantastic Story: Ella Enchanted is a remarkable story about never giving up
1, Very Cool!: This story is very good. Everything was described enough for you to picture it perfectly. Some parts are very exciting
1, Enchanting!!!: This is a momentous new version to the classic
1, Eall Enchanted: Ella Enchanted is an amazing
1, The best book: Thsi is the best book I have ever read! I read it 3 times in row
1, Good but not great: First off I would like to say that I like this book. It is a beautiful and original story. It just lacks contenuity
1, This book put a spell over me!!!: The book I will tell you about is called Ella Enchanted and written by Gail Carson Levine. I picked this book because I think it is funny
0, Needs a mind of its own: I thought the beginning of the book was great. There were many details and lots of descriptive language. I had no idea where it was going to until about the last 5 chapters when i knew it was an almost complete replica of Cinderella. The ending shoud've ended more individual.
1, totally cool dude!!!!!!!!!: i thought it was wonderfully written. Ella is full of spunk and is very brave. I love her charming personality and her cleverness. In her wonderfull world of Cinderella reincarnated
1, Must watch for parents: Ok
0, Review of the Disc Quality
1, Well
0, pathetic.: is it just me or is the new Hollywood 'gross-out' trend wearing thin? I mean
0, A LIMITED APPEAL: I agree with Mr. Olson's coments below that the appeal of this film is limited to a certain age range. For those above 25 or 30
0, It sure is American
1, Hmmmm...: Hey I'm all for gross stuff
0, A Porky's for the New Millenium: If you think that's a recommendation
0, Don't Like it and I'm not a Straightlaced Religious zealot!: I don't agree with the guy who said people who don't like this movie are straightlaced religious zealots
1, rent before buying it: When i first saw this I wasn't sure if it would be good but after seeing it I think that this is one of the best teen movies before not another teen movie. I Recommend renting it before buying it though. I have not seen the unrated version but i think it has more nudity then the original but i say go out in but some peaple might think its funny and some people might think its stupid and crude so thats why i say rent it before buying it.
0, Boring: I like to see films that are shocking
1," ""American Pie"" is a very funny teen sex comedy romp!: ""American Pie"" is a funny film. It is a very funny film. Clever writing is not the reason for the hilarity of this film. It is the sex gags. It is the performance of Jason Biggs. There are alot of things that make this a hilarious film. If you're looking for a good laugh then look no further than ""American Pie"". Now"
1, Funny movie has lots of heart-- takes you back to your teens: This was a much better movie than I thought it would be. Sure
0, stupid: This movie was so unfunny! You could see all the jokes coming from a mile ahead
1, An Incredible CD: Being a musician
1, Can't be beaten.: Just the perfect pop record. Everything Elliott Smith music is meant to be: Catchy
1, Always good: No matter how often I've seen this movie it is always entertaining.They don't make good western's like this any more. One of my twofavorites.
1, Wonderful Entertainment for Kids: We LOVE the Kidz Bop CD's. They're run and a great way to pass the time in the bath or dancing around for the kids. THey're fun and allow the kids to sing a long. Just GREAT.
0, aww how cute
0, o_o Save me world....: The first or second Kidz bop was cute and fine. Now it's out of control. Hearing girls yelling out lyrics of Green Day's 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' and Avril Lavigne's 'Nobody's Home' is worse than Hilary Duff yelling them out.They say these songs are kid approiate. Even through the songs listed above are some of the best songs this band and artist have sang so far
0, This has to stop: Oh my! Another kidz bop disc? Why am I not at all surprised? This really must stop. I'm floating on the fringes of sanity as we speak. Plus
0," Oh yay. Kidz Bop.: Okay. I'm sure everyone in the previous comments have spoken enough. I'll just add some more info.I can see Kidz Bop 10 now.TRACK LISTINGS!1. Ohio Is For Lovers - Hawthorne Heights (""Cut my wrist and black my eyes"") I mean"
0," No More!!!: Kids Bop now has eight albums can I ask how long this is going to go on? I'm sick of Kids Bop. I don't understand how people can listen to this. Even kids don't like this stuff. I know so many people who hate this stuff. The kids can't sing they are all out of tune cant get the notes or anything. Its sad but the truth. My brother who is seven laughs and makes fun of the commercial everytime it comes on. I'd love to work for Kids Bop because I love singing. But this is not what I call ""music""."
0, When will it ever end?: How many Kidz Bop CDs are they going to make? I don't see how they stay in business
0, not a good album: This is a very stupid album. Trust me I am a #1 fan of HILARY DUFF. She is way better than STUPID KIDZ BOP. Trust me parents get HILARY DUFF for your under 15 children.This is talia persad signing off. Please trust me PARENTS & KIDS UNDER 15
1, What a show!: While this version of Hamlet tends to skimp on the actual text
0, Gorblimey
1, Must Read for a WWII Buff: This is one of those books that come along rarely. Well written insightful and a good piece of history. If you are a WWII buff and especially aviation you owe to yourself to read this one. This IMHO would rank in the all time top ten of that genre. Highly recommend.
0, So so movie: Just not that great a movie. Pretty Woman has much better acting and better story.But if you really want to see these two actors again
1, Oh baby
1, Great movie
1, Erotic
1, Retro-Speed Metal Goodness!: Very interesting album... Retro-speed metal indeed. This is something like a mix of Speed
1, Icey Northern Metal from .... Texas?: This is definitely above average metal here
0, Does mediocre job with audio CDs: I bought this player so I could listen to audio and MP3 CDs on the road. It does a fine job with MP3s
1, Great unit but...: I think this is a great unit but... there is a couple of things missing for a 5 star: A belt clip to carry it around and a remote control on the headphones cable. It is really annoying to have to open each time your carrying case to fast forward a song
0, Horrible CD player
1, Birth & Death: Many people start to study Buddhism because they are interested in the ultimate mystery of life and death and have not gained a sufficient insight from western based philosophies. Unfortunately
1, This was a great watch: To go back in time and watch those legends play was great to see. You go throught a litle history of Lakers failing to win and then you get to know the best players and then you just go throught the season with them and finish as champions.West
0, Not what I expected: I was expecting solid sturdy plastic animals but these are not them. My daughter received them for her second birthday off her amazon wishlist. Now what we have them I wish I had never put them on there. They are hollow plastic and all of the large animals have rings around their necks where two pieces were put together. The quality of the rings varies wildly. On the pig it is barely noticeable yet the head of the goat is attached very poorly. If this had not been a gift I would be returning it.
1, Perfect!: My almost 2 year old son is in love with his animals. He likes to set them up on the table while he eats. He frequently says the name of the animal and makes their sound. They are perfect because they are large enough
1, 2-yo Daughter loves them: These have been a nice addition to the toy box. The only complaint is that the sheep's feet were not straight and so it barely stands up. But we've used them to teach her the names in both English and Spanish and the sounds. Everytime she sees a cow now (whether on a milk carton
1, Awesome: This product is wonderful. It big for little toddlers
0, Farm Animals Plastic Smell: While these animals are inexpensive
1, a great wood project: take off from those video games for a day and build a garden planter with a freind
1, Cantankerous Curmudgeon's Cornucopia of Cudgels: No doubt the man was a gifted wordsmith and an entertaining read. But his colorful irascibility about practically anything under the sun did get tiresome at some points in this selection. His quasi-obituary about William Jennings Bryan was one hell of a mean-spirited diatribe. Wow
1, WWJD?: I have read this book practically every day for the last 5 years. Each day there is some new insight which tugs at my heart and makes me think
0, THIS [BAD]!!!: This movie isn't scary at all
1, MY DESCENT INTO HELL WITH TIM ROBBINS: This film depicts a Vietnam veteran's post-war descent into hell. His 'hell' basically boils down to his waking up one day to realize he's no longer married to a white woman and raising a white son (a delightful pre-Party Monster MacCauley Culkin) in the suburbs. Instead he's now living with a woman of ambiguous hispanic origin in urban NYC. Hell is different things to different people. Personally my hell occurred back in early 2001 when I drank five cans of Sparks and ate a large batch of some brownies handed to me by frizzy-haired man wearing a pink headband
1, Not as great as I remembered
1, Climb the Ladder: For the sake of brevity I will not outline the plot. To the point; it is an excellent movie on a variety of levels; but foremost it excells in the ability to convey primal and surreal emotions embedded in a disturbing and complex plot. A great performance by the cast in a film that provides a glimpse into both the dark and soft-side of man.
1, a 'must have': Mullins' book is a 'must have' for students of Tibetology. Well written
1, This is not a movie about Autism: This is a about a child disturbed by the death of her father and who is told that she should not cry about it and also that her father is in the moon
0, Unrealistic
1, Tom Green in his prime......: Tom Green on VHS
1, Thank you
1, Effortless exercise!: I got these insoles since I walk so much anyway
0, Huge disappointment: Fortunately (judging from another review that said this book had a violent
1, Outstanding.: This book allows the reader to acquire good information at no or low cost from the Federal Government on virtually every health topic there is. A good value.
0, the worse Madonna remix ever!!!: this is such a beautiful song
1," Paper Towel Holder: This is a terrific item with great looks and style. It is heavy enough that it does not fall over when you pull on a paper towel. I ordered this one as it looked very similar to one that I had once owned. The other one had a ""brake release"" style button on top that allowed me to push down and stop the towels from rolling. This one works very well"
1, The BEST $20 product...ever!: Vidalia Chop WizardThis is the first time I have ever written a review but I thought the manufacturer of this food chopper deserves my accolades. I eat a lot of salads including celery
0, Yikes!: The good: an attractive lead and a storyline that had potential. The bad: everything else!If you want to see what a high school film class project looks like - this is the movie for you.Members of the film crew weren't actually knocking over the scenery or stumbling into the shots during filming
0, Waste of Money: This product is not durable
1," ""Good Sci-Fi Sequel!"": Arnold Schwarzenegger"
0, THIS I WHAT YOU CALL HIGH DEFINITION?: I just received this title on Blue Ray together with another Warner Bros titles
1, Loved it: This is an extremely rare movie
1, Great Movie: This morning for the first time in a long time I watched the first Terminator. I enjoyed it a lot. I even rated it my fav out of the first and second movie. Well Hubby and I just finished watching Terminator Judgment Day and I change my vote. This is my fav out of the two. I know this is bad
0, Great Movie! Terrible transfer...: I was really excited to get one of my favorite movies on Blu-ray
1, SIMPLY THE BEST: Terminator 2 is by far one of the best movies to date. The movies offers non stop action and suspense. Aside from this it had a great story. If you dont want to buy this i al least urge you to see it at least twice: once to enjoy the great effects and action
0, 2 stars for the HD version: I bought this specifically for the HD disc 2 in wmv.What they don't tell you is even though it is in wmv format
1, see it: this is by far the best in the series. its well acted and there are twists and turns to keep u interested in the story. its one of those few sequels that actually work. great action a amart plot and a few twists and turns makes this a must own
1," Avoid the Extreme DVD: I for one am very dissapointed with the so-called ""Extreme DVD"" edition that was released this year.The Ultimate Edition is arguably one of the coolest DVDs ever released but this newest edition is hardly the extreme DVD that the title says it is.The extra content that is on here is newly recorded commentary by James Cameron and his crew. While the commentary is good"
1," One O"" the best.: I think T2 is a great movie.I think for that year the special effects are so cool.I love movies"
0, Internet Connection Is Required to Play This Blu-Ray: The Disk keeps saying a profile 2.0 blu-ray player with an internet connection is required to play this disk. I'm not connected
1, The DVD Is Back!: T2 is perhaps one of the few Sequels that are as good as the original
0, I don't like this movie: Alright. When you say the end of the world
1, T2 ULTIMATE EDITION- The right choice: If you are wondering whether you should buy the Ultimate or Extreme edition of Terminator 2
0, BR Zone: It s a located Blu ray Disc.Amazon.com and this Blu ray don't mention it.I wasted 15$
0, Didn't play on either of my BluRay players: I don't recall ever getting a bad DVD or BluRay disc but this one came in looking fine. However
0, compatability issues: The picture and sound are great (as with all blu-ray I've purchased) but the stupid skynet menu system makes my HP laptop blu ray player very angry. I would recommend the non-skynet edition instead of this one for a T2 fan.
1," The sound blew me away!: There can be no doubt that this film is Schwarzenegger at his absolute best. I recently saw ""End of Days"" and it pales in comparison to this classic. The combination of DVD and THX digitally mastered sound is beyond belief."
0, What happened to the HD Audio?: An average to poor release with only slightly better than DVD Picture Quality and just a standard definition Dolby Digital soundtrack (probably straight from the earlier DVD releases)... Where is the uncompressed LPCM
1, Amazing Blu-Ray: Being a big fan of the movie
0, After a lot of time waiting for it.... It didn't worked !!!: The WMVHD version (that's the one I was interested at)
1, Terminator 2...the best of the three: Exciting and suspenseful. Great special effects. The best of the trilogy so far.
1, terminator2 dvd: must see dvd for all of arnolds fan's.great special effects
0, Waste!: It sucks that I have to constantly plug an ethernet cable into my modem everytime I want watch the flick. Not cool.

1, Powerful training games: Although this game maybe aimed for kids
1," Nice chain for a good price: 24"" 14K gold chain was a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it. The length was perfectly described. The only problem I had was the blue velvet pouch that it came with"
1," This is an excellent textbook .: You can read this book without any help except in the ""logarithmic and exponential functions"" chapter that you must read it twice or more often to understand the concepts of these ""functions""."
0, broke easily: we bought this umbrella for my son along with the matching boots. the boots are great
1, Tech's Review: I WAS SURPRISED BY THE HUMOR IN THIS BOOK ABOUT THE OREGON TRAIL. MOST OTHER BOOKS ON THIS TOPIC ARE VERY SERIOUS. I COULD NOT HELP BUT READ THE REST OF THE SERIES. THE FRANCIS TUCKET SERIES IS ABOUT FRANCIS TUCKET WHO IS KIDNAPPED BY PAWNEE INDIANS
0, Disappointing book: I'm sorry to report that I was disappointed in this book. I think the conversational format interfered with my ability to truly engage in the substance of the topics. Plus
0, I love the series but can't recommend this game: I have 3 previous Tony Hawk games that I adore
1, its good: this game is fun...its alot different then the other 6 games hes done...it just seemed like it was the same thing coming out over and over again...but this one is wayyy different and wayy more fun to play..its grandget it
1, Excellent Book!: One of the best books
1, Sippie cup saver.: Playtex spill-proof cups are worth their weight in gold to any parent with toddlers. The cup is only as good as the valve though. I had 2 cups that were pretty much useless without working valves. I was so happy to not have to throw these cups away. I ordered 2 packs as more valves are surely to go bad over time.
1, Saves you money from buying new sippy cups: These are exactly the same as the inserts that come with the platex sippy cups. I was so glad to find these because we seem to keep losing the inserts and I don't want to have to replace an entire cup due to the lack of an insert. They work just as good as the original. I bought the smaller pack and then promptly lost some more inserts so now I'm wishing I bought the larger pack to have some extras.
1, Much better than I expected . .. .: Decent performances
0, Not well put together: This film is about a girl who gets into the wrong crowd after her father's death.I found it was disjointed though. Tek's character was interesting while Eva's was not developped. The film had some kind of haze in many of the scenes (useless as far as i am concerned). Sometimes shes dreaming
0, not what I thought it was: I thought this book was going to have stories that people could easily remember and tell at a campfire. Wrong! A few of the stories were short and okay but I can't imagine kids sitting and listening to the short stories let alone the long ones. I found this book boring and not at all what I thought it would be. Sorry.
0, Bring back Joanna!: I have always been a huge fan of the Thoroughbred series until I read the latest books. They are absolutely nothing like the others
0, where did all of the main characters go?: I don't know about anybody else but from what I have read it seems like everyone feels the same way I do about what has happened to the Thoroughbred series. I mean like where did Cindy go not to mention Samantha
0, We want Cindy and Samantha!: I haven't read this book

1, A great book: This is a very good book adout a little six year old girl who lives in Aguascalientes
1, esperanza rising: The name of the book I just finished reading is called Esperanza rising. The author of this book is Pam Munos Ryan. Esperanza was rich intill she became poor.It was better then the book the giver.Esperanza got what ever she wanted. But then her dad got killed by bandits. They moved to the u.s. because her uncle wanted to force Esperanza mother to get merried with him. Esperanza mother got very sick.Esperanza was rich but then her dad died. So her mom was going to be force to merrie her uncle. So they moved to Los Angeles to runaway and start a new life. In Los Angeles her life started to change she wasn't as rich as she us to.I recomend this book to people who like historical fiction. I think this is one of the best book i ever readed in my life.
1, SWEET STORY! N.T.: This is a great story about Esperanza
1, Esperanza Rising: Esperanza Rising is a book about a 13 year old girl who is starting over. Esperanza is the main character. In the beginning
1, Good Book: I like that in this book there is always something big happening which makes you want to read it more.
0, boring...: We had to read this book in school
0, Yuck
1, The little trees that didn't die in transit!!!! Amazon rocks.: Good Grief
0, OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST: A shipping cost of $8.80 for a $1.99 hair net is OUTRAGEOUS! The item was shipped in a box that was way too big
0, Nice idea
0, Big Dissapointment: I bought this movie as soon as it was released on DVD
1," If you don't like this movie get a lobotomy!: There is nothing short of brilliant comedy in this film about a struggling movie producer(Martin) who reads ""Chubby Rain"" and decides to make the movie. But he can't get the biggest star in Hollywood"
0, a waste of time: A total waste
0," ha ha ha ?: ""Where are the laughs?"" one might ask when watching this movie. You will find about 2 genuine laughs and a chuckle here and there. The story went nowhere although it started with lots of potential to be a riot. If you have seen the commercials and previews for this movie"
1, I love this movie!!!: I have fond memmories of watching this movie with my mom as a kid. Its still hilarious and I would recommend it.Not for children under 15 or so.
1, Worth 5 stars: This is the best book in statistical quality control. A very good start for undergraduates. However
1, THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR.....: RANDOM HEARTS
0, Lost without a cause: Next to the bomb Wild Wild West with Wil Smith
0, Why is there not a '0 Star' rating?: I like Harrison Ford
0, Thumbs Down: I was terribly disappointed by a movie with actors as classy as Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. There seemed to be no acting at all in this movie- just a constant plodding from one scene to the next. Also
0, Strange Movie: The basic plot to the movie is that Ford's and Thomas's spouses are having an affair together and die in a plane crash. Then Ford and Thomas develop a relationship together. A very strange plot and a very slow one too. I'm a big Harrison Ford fan and own most of his movies
0, There is no need.: This is a compilation that was really unnecessary. There has been two best-of compilations made prior to this
0, Fantastic Show...: ...But an absurd DVD. As virtually everyone else has said
1, I have happy.: This is fabulous.That being said
1, Better than being there: Not being very good with a gun
1, African Game Trails by Roosevelt: Excellent reading for all those interested in completing their study of Theodore Rooseveltand his son Kermit. While historical
1, This book is wonderful.: This is the only book I've read that talks about how a multiple's system may be structured. Now I understand why my insiders rarely come out

0," Sent the wrong size: I ordered the 1/2"" x 1/4"" x 36"" brass bar. They sent a 1/2"" x 3/16"" x 36"" bar instead. This isn't just my measurement - the bar is clearly marked as .1875 x .50"

0, THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH DELL INSPIRON **NO STARS**: Don't bother spending your money
0, Almost caught my house on fire!: I bought two of these
0, Sucks: Not enough voltage for my Dell Inspiron E1505 and my battery is new but it won't charge the battery. Maybe that's why it's so cheap.
1, A good read: Very entertaining with a little twist at the end. I always enjoy books by Diane Chamberlain. She's a good choice for all of you Kindle readers out there.
1, at least 6 stars: the most amaizing and surprising book
0, A Big Disappointment -- a reader and soon to be mom: I bought this book with high hopes and couldn't wait to receive it. However

1," not bad for a start: This was an album that bristled with energy and versatility. Not all rock bands take on the blues with blistering passion and get it right. LZ did on this album. My favs off the album would have to be ""Baby IM Gonna Leave You"" and ""How Many More Times""."
1, A great start: Led Zeppelin's debut album is without doubt
1," The blues LED ZEP style.: ""You shook me baby"" and ""Dazed and confused"" are some of the best blues riffs I have ever heard.Jimmy ""magic fingers"" Page has defined and mastered the blues.The seductive voice of Robert Plant makes them legendery and not duplicated. ROCK ON !!"
1, Led Zeppelin
1, Best Freshman album of all time: This first album by the god's of rock was perfect. Led Zeppelin wasted no time in letting everyone know that they were great. Robert Plant
0, Well Overrated: I've never understood what people saw in this band. No real melody
0, A disgrace: Led Zeppelin butchered the blues on this album. They use these classic songs as a vehicle to propell them to commercial success. This sad mockery of the blues basically signifies what Zepp was all about - making trivial music.
1, TOTAL MASTERPIECE DEBUT!!!: The LED ZEPPELIN debut is a total masterpiece!!! ALL the songs are the pure heavy rock like GOOD TIMES BAD TIMES
0, made of plastic: This faucet got hung up and wouldn't swivel easily (grime in the base). I turned the faucet from the left sink to the right it snapped off at the base. Beneath the stainless steel outside
0, mahjong 110: This game is nothing like anything I would play. I dont care for it at all. I am very disappointed in this game.
0, It Only Works For a Little While: This game only worked for a couple of months. Then
0, Mahjongg tile game: This particular game turned out to be bit of a let down. The problem with this game [for me anyway] is that the graphics have a point of view like you're sitting at a table rather than a top down view. definitely detracts from the game play. strike two is that the tiles are so big you have to scroll left
0, Not for Mahjongg players: Have trouble navigating thru the different games. I just wanted a simple game of Mahjongg
1, really cool: This artists knows what he wants. it's a bit like the daft punk album
0, Not widescreen: Double Platinum was filmed in Widescreen even though it was a made for tv movie. the region 2 PAL dvd in the UK is Widescreen. Re-release this dvd in widescreen

1, TOP LITERARY MIDWIFE: Scott Berg's biography of Max Perkins is a warm
0, It's No Brown Bear.: This is cute- but
1, Great Illustrations: This book has great illustrations! Eric Carle really out does himself with the illustrations. They seem so real. It's almost like you're in the book. I would recommend this book to any one
0, Too sweet to buy without flying paper trick: Like another reviewer
0, bitter and not that yum: bought these for a group of family who loves coffee / tea and was visiting my home. the packing is awesome and the cookies look very preciously packed.however I wasn't impressed by them at all taste wise. found them to be bitter and lots of essence. was disappointed as I was really counting on them and thought with the packing and reviews
1, attractive tin and good cookies: I found the Amaretti cookies at World Market but bought the attractive tin on Amazon. My wife collects tins and was quite please.
0, ABSOLUTLY DEVOID OF ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER: This work sounds like it was recorded in the mildewy basement of an anemic whining limp-wristed flake who can't even play an instrument properly. The people responsible for this hideous affair should be locked in a deep dank closet and forced to read The Complete Works of Joseph Stalin by candlelight until their whimpering ceases. Do not buy this CD
1, Bens definitive review of Less Talk More Rock: A great album
1, Publicly subsidized. Privately profitable.: This album follows in the tradition set by prop in me. The strong politically correct lyrics
0," Make sure you check for firmware upgrades: Right now this product does not have a ""resume"" feature"
1, Incredible: You know the band you are listening to rocks if they blow away people like me who don't even speak Japanese. The entire album is a masterpiece and a lot better than some of the English speaking albums I own. Withering to Death is something you can listen to two or three times a day and not get bored of it. I will admit
1, A: Great fight movie
0," BE CAREFUL - NOT AS DESCRIBED!: I trusted Amazon to list the product information correctly - how hard can it be? It's written on the back of the DVD case! Amazon product details state ""Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only) but on the back of the DVD case it CLEARLY states ""DVD 9"
1, AMONG THE TOP ADVENTURE STORIES FOR BOYS AND SCOUTS: Gary Paulson is an excellent storyteller with a keen sense of adventure. the story opens with a young boy en route via a small plane to see his father in the wilderness when the plane crashes and the pilot dies. All the boy has is a tiny hatchet that was given to him before he left on his trip. He sets out on a path of survival as he awaits rescuing. This book contains mature themes (death
0, Painful. To. Read.: This book was very boring and repetitve. Who cares about the story of a kid who goes gallomphing in the bush like a magical pixie horse? Gary Paulsen created a very flat and anti social character whose only friend was fire. He spent 5 chapters decribing his relationship with it! It is like all the other surrival stories
0, TOO SLOW AND LOW: This reading is VERY slow and the volume is really low. I had to play it on my surround sound system so my class could hear it. I ended up reading the majority of the book to them out loud.
1, Still a great read!: An oldie but a goodie. Students love this story because it shows us that we can all be survivors. This audio version was purchased to help those students who prefer auditory to visual input. A real winner!
1, Exciting!!!!!!!!!: Gary Paulsen had very good description of how Brian (main character) survived. The excitement never ends! I felt like I there observing him there in the wilderness. He is very resourceful
0, my dum paragraph: I gave Hatchet a 1 star because cried for a friend like a baby.It was boring because he was saying the same words over and over.In a nother word it ... .
1, Hatchet by Gary Paulsen: Hatchet by gary paulsen.I am doing this review for a book project in my english class. I picked this book because I always hear people talking about how good it is. So I decided to find out for myself weather it is good or not. I'm not really big on reading so not to many books intrest me but when I read the first page of this book it had my full attention and I did not want to put it down. The first chapter is full of action and excitement. Throughout this book a thirteen year old boy tries to survive with very few supplies. Luckly for him though it is summer and not winter. He has a hatchet that his mother gave him and a few more supplies from the plane.I'm not going to spoil the rest of the book for the people who have not read this action
1, A Book Like No Other: This story is about a boy who is going to visit his dad for the summer. While on the way there he is involved with a plane crash after the pilot has a heart attack. Brian has to survive in the wild by making shelter and finding food. He has to fight all the things that happen in the wilderness and starts to adapt. One night something had approached him in the night. He threw his hatchet and it made a spark. Will he make it back?I would recommend this book to anyone thats wants to read about some adventure and mysterys.

1, HATCHET: The Hatchet is about a teennager named Brain. It was in the summer when Brain was going to see his dad because his parents are seperated.

When Brain took off the pilot asked him if he wanted to stir the plan but Brain was afraid but still he did it anyway. After awhile the pilot had a heart attact and he thought that it was something that he ate that morning but it wasn't. The pilot was knock out cold
0, Oh
0, TERRIBLY BORING!!!!!: This book is just about the worst book I hve ever read in my life. The sequence of events is dull and extremly predictable. Don't read this book if you have a choice.
0," Not a Good Book: Brian kept on using the ""Secret"". Paulsen could've left that out. I didn't like his style of writing. Some details went a little far on plucking a bird and having the guts come out"

0, It was o.k.: I think the thing that I don't like most about this book is that it only has one character through mostlt the whole book. I like books that have a lot of characters and diolouge. Other than that the book was preety much
1, Jake's review: I like this book because its not a very hard book to read and it doesn't take long to finish it . I also like this book because its has a lot of adventures and it keeps you wondering. Hatchet is a book about a boy who goes to see his dad in the Canada's oil fields. When his pilot has a heart attack
0, a great bore: This book is quiet boring and stupid. It is very slow not a one cliffhagger! sevral times I was almost forced to sleep by boredom. I thought it was very depressing to read.I was very disappointed because it was a very reccomnded book
0, This book was incredibly boring---: I read this in 2'd grade and hated it. The lack of dialogue and organization in this book made it seem very weak and unrealistic. I believe that if I mixed up the chapters of this book 
1, Hatchet CD: Hatchet on CD. Great reading. Great book! My children loved it. My 4th
1, Why a hatchet matters: 'Hatchet' is a pretty good book. The story starts outa little slow

1, School Project: In Hatchet there is a boy named Brian Robeson who is 13 years old riding in a airplane. The plane crashes and Brian has to survive in the wilderness. He runs into a little bit of trouble. ALL he has to survive with is a hatchet. It's a good survival book.
1, juan's revew on hatchet: I chose Hatchet as my favorite book because it is the only book that's really gotten to me in the way he had of how he suffered to live and the way he was found this is the reason why I'm rating Hatchet as a five.
1, A PAGE TURNER: Street dreams is a classic
1, Mad
0, WASTED EFFORT: THis is a embarassing effort by Dream Works studios. A total bomb. The movie doesn't gives what promises in the cover: a good comedy. Instead
0, lame...: this film was okay...i really dislike Kate capshaw and didn't care to see this movie
0, This is a really BAD movie: Don't waste any time on this disaster masquerading as a movie. It's boring and unoriginal. The characters are one-dimensional
0, Good idea for a movie
0, I'm sorry... we all make mistakes.: Mandylion and Nighttime Birds are two albums I really love (5 stars). Unfortunately in this album quantity has won over quality. The amazing voice of Anneke (I hate to say) can't capture my attention and at times begins to annoy me. It really lacks a song that stands out. When I hear this album I have a feeling that i'm hearing the same thing over and over again. This album has not made it to my car-stereo.
0, Not metal: You guys better start counting
0, If you like Mandylion
0," Dropping the ball: I'm not sure who was in charge of putting this dvd set together but I think they definately dropped the ball in the production of this season release. You wouldn't ever see Law and Order or Seinfeld release a ""Best of Season x"" dvd leaving out certain less popular or less watched episodes. I would have been perfectly happy paying a little more to get the rest of this dvd set. On top of that"
0, who came up with this idea?????????: why oh why would you put out only half a season of a show when just the year before you put out a whole season. i also will not buy this and will only buy it when the ENTIRE third season is put out!!!!!
1, A Must Have: This is truly an original must have. Not only has one of his greatest hit of all time
0, Unfortunately
1, Awesome second album: Speaking as one who's life TRULY changed in the summer of 1976
0, A little too pat: Dead on the Dance Floor tries too hard to have a wide pool of suspects to the murder. The subplot of the homeless girl
0, VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!: This product states that it will take your hair
1, Awesome song! Great instrumentals at end!: Pearl Jam is one of my favorites
0, This product was not any good.: It took me a few days to open the package and check the memory. Outside it looked okay but when I put this memory stick into my computer
1, See this Movie!!: I love this movie! Can't recommend it enough - beautifully rendered
1, Perfect!: Did you ever need one little piece to complete a project? This one fits the bill with installation and quality. Easy!!!
0, Wrangler Jeans are impostors (mexico): I love Amazon.com
0, major defect in the jeans - both front pockets had holes in them: Ordered up a pair
0, Sent me the wrong size!: I ordered Men's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34. When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34. However
1, Great...wish they came in colors: I am not a Jeans person. This is the first pair I have had since I was a kid and they fit great and they are going to be a great knock around the house
1, Great Jeans: The length options for these jeans goes above and beyond any store. You're lucky to find 32 length in stores
1, jeans: The jeans are fine
1, Great Jeans: These are great jeans. 5 pocket
1, pants that fit: The wrangler jeans I purchased fit well and was just what I hoped they would be.I take a large size so I was very happy with the selection I made.
1, Great jeans!: I bought these for my son for Christmas (at his. request). He says they are the most comfortable jean he has ever worn. Thanks!
1, FANTASTIC: In this enthralling process
0, Difficult to follow.: I read health and nutrition books for pleasure and this was one I could barely get through. It was translated and perhaps thats why it is so hard to follow. The book skips around and gives little solid information. Also
1, Excellent: This is a great book. Very inspiring and right to the point. (no pun intended) The only thing wrong with it is me!
0, Damaged Item Sold as Good Quality: This book-on-tape was damaged when I received it. The tape does not work properly -- it slows down and is not useable.
1, Teacher's Grade: A-: This is an engaging story empowering children to believe that they can have an effect on the world around them if they work within the rules that exist. There are some humorous situations
1, Hoot: The book Hoot is a very interesting book. It is really funny and random. The genre is mostly comedy and mystery. It is the funniest book I ever read. I really like Roy
1, Hoot is GREAT!!!: Hi!While I was reading Hoot I loved it
1, Hoot is a Hoot: OK First of all this is supposed to be a book for kids.I have read about everything Hiaasen has written. I am a 50+ adult and loved this book. Any one who likes Hiassens work will find this fun and a little less bizarre then his adult work. I almost never give a rating of 5 stars but this deserved it.
1, Sparkley tails? COOL!: The runaway kid
1, 4th graders goin into 5th read: you guys i read this book and loved it books like this you cant stop loving them i stayed up reading till 6 am i like to make it good by reading more authors notes and stuffps Read This

0, Stopped working after 3 weeks: Worked fine for 3 weeks. Stopped sensing the sensor. I could move the magnet past the sensor and hear its internal reed switch click open/close. But
0, Doesn't work out of the box: I only give it 1/5 b/c there isn't an option for 0 stars. After proper set-up and installation
0, PTI Schwinn 12 Function Computer: I purchased this odometer/computer for my mountain bike. Assembly was not difficult at all. I did have one question. I called the 800 number that was provided and the agent was very helpful.Bad News- On my second ride
0, handle is very flimsy: received item in a prompt manner but the handle is very loose and the blade isn't sharp at all. I don't like to bother with sending things back so i will keep it as a show piece because despite its terrible handle its still a beautiful sword. I just know for future orders to stay away from this particular company!
1, the book is necessary for exegesis and research: It's very useful for the process of the exegesis and study of the OT.
0, Wasn't for me: I tried three times to get into this book. I am an avid reader of many different kinds of books. This one just was not for me.
1, Good read!: I really liked this book. Lots of good medical and technical detail. A somewhat slow start but definitely picking up as I went in. A satisfactory ending and plenty of suspense. I was compelled to read and finish it and that is the mark of a great book to me.
1, Dead end: Good to the last drop.you know who it is but how do you tell them how do they stop him but they do
0," disappointing: I was disappointed in the actual appearance of these blocks for my son's 2nd birthday... small and""boring"". Wish I would've searched more for larger blocks that had more inspiring colors/ prints on them..."
0, Tedious and boring: Put this stinkburger down after 80 pages. I wanted o disembowel myself to stop themind-numbing monotony. Way too much meaningless detail and tedious descriptions ofcrap that never mattered or moved the story along.Almost as bad as James Lee Burke filling page after page with repititive scene andlandscape descriptions to get to 300 pages.Wambaugh is definitely not a Caunitz or even aMahoney but he's light years away from Sandford who is my favorite.
1, Similarly Intriguing: A hapless protagonist dropped in the midst of unexpected circumstances only to find his way out by his own good fortune and the assistance of newfound friends. Such is the signature Ambler tale his fans have learned to like and expect. They'll be happy to find another one here. They may not be so happy to find some of the same characters they encountered inBackground to Dangeror a protagonist that is strikingly similar as well. Indeed
0, it's like a book review....: this version absolutely sucks. its like a book report and is a summary and not what i thought it was. good for kid's who hate reading and need to get through tom sawyer quick. If your older and liked huck finn and never read tom sawyer
0, Not my favorite reference.: As a first year nursing student
0, just another DJ now...: I used to dig his style back in 1991
0, Bad Fiction: This was a slow
0, science fiction: If this were written by someone known to write science fiction
0, I love Robin Cook & hated this book!: But I hate sience fiction! If you are looking for and expecting a typical Robin Cook medical mystery
1," One of the most perfect novels ever written: I am a big Robyn Cook fan and didn't even know it. I read Robyn Cooks's ""Primal Fear"" years ago"
0, Worst book ever.: This book was terrible from beginning to end. I felt like a child was trying to tell me a story with how non descriptive it was. The only character that was of any interest was Suzanne and she was mediocre at best. I guess I wont get into details about the story in case anyone actually wants to read this but just so you know if you don't like the story at the beginning it doesn't get any better. I wish I could have the time back from reading this book. The ending actually pissed me off but atleast I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.
0, Interesting Subject - Character Stereotypes: I've read all of Robin Cook's books and this is the only bad one in the lot. I didn't like his choice of characters
0, Bad writing: I cannot remember reading a book as bad as this in a long
0, Abduction: I am an avid Robin Cook fan and found this book to be a great disappointment. Getting past the fact it was not a medical thriller

0, Bad TV ??: Being a science fiction fan (versus medical fiction fan)
1, A Great Book: The Lion
0, not so catchey: a do not recomend this book i do not like it all if your planning to buy it return it. my dad made me read it so bad
0, Boring!: These books are probabley the worst books that I have ever read in my entire life. They keep going on and on about nothing. We were forced to read them at school. They really stink.
0," ""Michael York Ruins This Recording"" as previously stated: I love this particular book in the series and was sooooo disappointed when I began listening to it. I could not believe that the producer of the audio tapes wasn't cringing as I was every time Michael York slipped into his Aslan"
1, Blah: I read this book a while back
1, sportscene: I like thes book becouse it is sad and happy. When the lion roars then the lion kills the Witch. why I read this book is that it is exciting and the oldest boy kilt the wolf. Atthe end the witch kilt the yongest boy.
1, awsome!!!: when i picked up this book after church one sunday i was expecting a older-kid tolkien style book. well after reading the first four chapters i discovered it wasn't all that. narnia itself would go through the age-limits of 8-adult but this book was focused more on younger ages. well at about the fourth chapter I really started to doubt the book and felt I was not going to read another narnia book
1, All creatures big and small: The Lion
1, A little disappointing: I never encountered Lewis's books as a child in the 50s and was glad to be spurred to read this one recently for a children's book discussion group. I was a little disappointed with it

0, CD-ROM Beware: I bought the audio version so I could listen in my car. I didn't see anywhere that is mentioned this CD is a CD with MP3s on it. I cannot return it since I opened it to see what the deal was. I am really angry at Amazon for this. If I wanted the MP3's I could have just bought the MP3 Downloads

1," Wonderful Book: I highly recommend Gary Chapman's ""5 Love Languages."" My fiance and I were almost to the breaking point for multiple reasons. This book made us pause and realize we have something worth fighting for. And it taught us how to begin on the road back. Loving each other in each person's love language has made a huge difference."

1, Great Classic Comedy: First of all: the five stars are for the movie
1, St. Louis Buyer: I purchased this toy because I thought that it could teach a child just turning 3 about colors and shapes. My son says our Grandson loves it and plays with it all the time. I love the fact that it is a toy that a child can use his imagination and can play with for hours instead of minutes like some other toys. Very good purchase.
1, best blocks!: These blocks are great fun
0, too small: I wouldn't recommend this. I totally agree with Tracy's comment. They are way too small. I thought the price was great but when I saw them in the store I was so disappointed.
1, Better than we thought: The kids are happier than a clam at high tide whistling dixie!Pros: Slightly larger than your average domino (thought they may have been tiny).And with 100(!) of em each of the kids have plenty to play with without arguing.Also
0, such small blocks: Although it was my fault for not reading the age recommendations
1, Great!!: This toys is great. Just one thing

0, Shaky Start: Though there is a good story here
0, New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition): This book would have been terrific if the publisher would have taken the trouble to check the printing. There is one important section left out and one section repeated. In attempts to contact the publisher for resolution of the mistake
1, Great funky album.: this album is great for it's fun vibe
0, Same old crap: His music sucks major big time. It's the same old lame music over and over & same old filter sound. I am very disappointed about this CD. What a rip off!If you got one BT's CD
0, Banal drudgery: Ignore the undeserving pseudointellectual hype surrounding this book. It is nothing but a displeasureable collection of banal observations and anecdotes
1, Hummingbird a hit!: The hummingbird flosser makes the chore of flossing teeth easier and a lot less messy. Great way to get kids into the habit of flossing.
1, Love the Hummingbird~!: I have used the Hummingbird since it first came out
0, Wasn't what title said.: Interesting history lesson. But no teeth or author gives no insightful understanding of scripture and why god would want us to be rich.
0," just slightly disappointed: This band's awesome ""Breakbeat Science Excercise 6"" is what encouraged me to buy this disc. I love the artwork on the disc itself. However"
0, Informational and imaginative but not captivating: The detailed description of convent living in the 1950s was informative and educational. Curiosity alone should encourage people to buy this book. But for the true romantic
1, a good record by Steve Vai: This album contains two true gems 'The boys from Seattle' (which sounds very hendrixian - and in a beautiful way
1," ""Stop!"
1, Freaking great: This is an amazing collection of live studio music. The variety of songs and artists is wonderful
0, Pass on this one: Radio station in-house recordings can be hit or miss. The Mountain and others have some really great productions. I wish I had passed on this one. The selections are poor with no production quality.
1, great fan: This is a high quality fan. It gives off a powerful blast of air. The fan doesn't take up a lot of space
1, Great fan: Like other reviews have said
1, TURBO FAN: Honeywell HT800 Super Turbo High Performance Fan
0, Never going to buy Honeywell fans: I've had this fan for 8 years. BUT I probably only turned it on for 30-60 minutes a day during the hottest weeks of the year.So worst case
1, Great circulation: I have this fan in my room at night. It really helps keep the room cool. I have a window a/c unit but the fan on that doesn't circulate the air. This is a powerful unit. It works effectively on low in a bedroom. I also have the HT 900 model
0, Inexpensive
0, You Get What You Pay For!: This is the cheapest noisy fan China can bring us.Good name (once) dulled and dimmed to a sub-par piece of junk.NOISY...if you want noise
1, Loud
1, Changing Pad: I received the changing pad in mail yesterday. I bought it based on the positive reviews. I only give it a 4 out of 5 b/c I have not used the pad yet. It looks like it will be a good changing pad but I will just have to wait and see.
1, Not highbrow but enjoyable nonetheless: I don't even remember what brought this film to my attention but I'm glad it did. Some days I'm up for a cinematic challenge; other days
1, Wonderful little movie: I'm really glad this finally came out on DVD. No big American stars in it
1, Blown Away: All I can say is WOW! I stumbled up on this on Netflix
1, Works nicely to replace rusted metal version: Got these to replace the original rusted metal version. Easy to mount
1, Very good!: It's a beautiful album! A good collection of all the best songs of Mandy Moore! She's is sweet and we can notice her voice getting better in the most recent songs!
0, Just wasn't right for me: Honestly
0, God as a vending machine: This book was recommended to me by a friend. After the first chapter
1, A super Billie H collection!: I love this compilation of Billie Holiday gems.Holiday pleases in this one. It has a lot of her earlier works
1, Beautiful Music: I had never heard Nicole sing before
0, This one is just not for Me: This was a book that was just not writen for me. I did not care for the casual drug usage.Why did Topaz have to throw the phone everytime she hangs up.Anyway this is a book that took me back
1, Classic Boomer TV: If seeing the Tomorrow Show doesn't make you nostalgic -- you aren't really a boomer.Great guests
1, Very Good Item: Purchased these mints as a good alternative to that extra cup of coffee. Excellent if you are on a long drive and don't want to stop for another cup o' joe.
0, Okay Product: This would be a really good product if it fit the seat on my bike. After reading some of the other reviews
1, a ray of light in a dark dungeon pit: I live in a hellish
0, Knee Highs Definitely Stay Up!!: These QUEEN size knee high nylons with cotton soles will DEFINITELY stay up for you...in fact
0, Personalized with STICKERS! And crummy ones at that...: We received this order only to find out the already relatively cheap life ring was personalized with cheap stickers. These stickers were already peeling off upon removing it from the shipping bag! You can tell they were put on my hand because they were not even straight. Wow. $49.99 for a $5 life ring and 20 cent stickers. They did offer to take it back
1, The other side of the story: David Simon's follow-up to Homicide
1, Not for everyone but great for those seeking a different view: I've lived in Baltimore my entire life. Well to be fair. near Baltimore. I found this a compelling and interesting look at a social epidemic. For those of us that don't understand addiction or the situation in the inner cities first hand this is a mind blowing and outlook changing look at the situation from the side of those that live it every day. This series changed my entire outlook. If you like this try watching 'The Wire' and 'Homicide: Life on the Street'
1," TOO BAD ""I DON'T WANNA CRY"" IS MISSING: I have both the U.S. release and the Australian Import"
1, Very handy and useful: I like using this Black and Decker cordless drill because it is so handy that you can use it to carry out household repairs efficiently.
1, Great price!: I got this as a gift for my mom.. I'm sure she'll love it and this was an awesome price thank you
0, Doesn't stand--falls over!: Picked one of these up at the Borg to hang some curtains. The dumb drill cannot be set on its base without it falling forward towards the chuck. That means you won't be able to sit it on the window ledge
1, Amazing: Very very good product durible lastes form falling off a tree and winter in a garage great product hit bu go kart and was minorly scrached love product long batterey life kinda slow but doesnt die
0, doesn't fit my use: This product may be good for some uses but for mine it just didn't have the power to do the job.
1, Dana's Quest: Two heads are better than one
1, Scotland revisited: I visited Scotland this past summer
1, More than Excellent!: I have read (audio) this book twice. It's in the line up once more. Mr. Ellis is one of the most outstanding authors of our time. His book on our Greatest President makes His Excellency a man above all others in the American experience. Without Ellis
0, Character Assassination: It is sad. The author has made big bucks on a book that essentially is aimed at bringing George Washington down to the level of today's politicians. There certainly is an audience for this kind of interpretation of our Founding Father and it can only be accomplished by someone who has a perspective and wants to use his skills to slant the reader's view toward his own negativity. I much preferred to read David McCullough's history
1, A worthwhile read for the education provided; but it is dry...: 1. Unlike many who have written detailed reviews
0, Lightweight at best!: Our founding father deserves a proper biography. Unfortunately
0, This is a music concert? Ha!: I found this movie looking thru new music concert videos. Somehow by the picture I dont think this is about music.
1, The Irish angel: A wonderfully gory tale
0, Disappointing for Leap Frog: We have 21-month olds twins
0, Interesting women
0, Elbow and Knee Pads Do Not Work: I purchased this for my daughter to go with her new princess bike. The helmet and bell are fine
0, DO NOT BUY: I purchased this item for my daughter. The helmet did not fit that great. And the knee and elbow pads are usless being as stiff as a board and my daughter could not even use them.. I ended up throwing them out. May I suggest that you just go to a proffesional bike shop like I ended up doing. Your kids saftey is worth it!Hope this helps!!
1, Ton's of fun for grandson: What a way to fly around the back yard for my little 5 year old grandson. This big wheel will grow with him and will give years of use. A Great gift for a little boy !
1, Great: Easy to put together. Love the rims and flag :) Seat is very adjustable. Chrome handlebars. Everything seems great on this item.
1, big wheel: While the toy seems to be durable 
1, Great - Seems to be more durable than Big Wheel: My mom just purchased this for my four year old for his birthday. He's already figured out how to go down the hill and spin out at the bottom...as we all did on our big wheels. The front tire of our big wheel wore out quickly from regular use with our older son. This front tire has some additional hard plastic on it that provides reinforcement where it is needed the most. My son is a typically sized 4 year old and this will grow with him for a few years. I'm really happy we found this product!
0, Misleading bike description: I bought this for my 3 year old son who has always been considered tall for his age and he still can't ride this darn bike because his feet can't reach the pedal when he tries to ride it. The description of the bike says for 36 months but my son is now 3.5 years old and still can't ride this bike. Very frustrating....plus he says the seat hurts his back. Very disappointed in overall purchase of this bike.
0, Defective - Unable to Assemble: The manufacturer misaligned the metal plate on the wheel bar
0, How tall does child need to be?: We bought the radio flyer big flyer May 2011 for our twin grandsons' three year old birthday. They could not reach the pedals with the seat all the way up. They are now fast approaching four years old and still cannot reach the pedals. Any suggestions?
0, Not that great.: I bought this light from Walmart for about 15 dollars.First of all the headlight is large and nothing about it says sleek
1, An Excellent Reference: This is the most complete reference I have seen on the subject
0, Not platinum: Not a single well-known song by Glen Campbell
1, Take note -- when you need the very best!: If you think it's opera
1, Great reference source: This is an excellent book for beginners to AMOS
1, LOTS of fun: My son got this at age 7. LOTS of fun! My 22yr old had a blast with it too. Smaller kids will need help building the different figures
1, Tingle Toes: This foot massager is easy to use and leaves your feet feeling tingly . The aftereffect is a mild sensation up the legs that feels like the circulation is going. Much better than the cheaper foot massagers that have no effect at all.Good to share with friends and family . A conversation piece that tickles the fancy ..
1, Journal: Love Medicine is an eloquently written story which helps us understand life on a reservation and
0, LOVE MEDICINE Journal#8: This was not that good of a story cause at times it sounded crazy and confusing. But one good thing about it was that the Indian family was very close to one another. The individuals in it cared alot for one another and during rough times they all came together. I would not want to read this book again because it is just not worth it. I believe there are alot of better books than this out there. Everyone is entitled to his/her own decisions and opinions but I do not think this was the book for me
1, Out Of The Dust: I think this is a very thought provoking book. It really makes you think about how fortunate you are compared to those people. I am so glad that every evening when i eat dinner I don't have to worry about my dinner being covered with dust or whether the pepper is really pepper:0). It has some very sad parts
0, This book stinks!!!!!!!!!!: This book was the dumbest book I have ever read. What girl could be so stupid that she would throw kerosene on ones own mother. I suggest you read any other book besides this one.
1, A MUST read: The Dust Bowl is raging on and Billie Jo is in the middle of it. Her family is struggling to keep their farm in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Billie Jo's mother wants to move but her father is convinced that he can make something grow. Then
1, C FOR COOL: I tghink that other kids would enjoy reading this book.This book was about a family that wanted a boy but instead the mom gave birth to a girl name Billy.This book was good because they had a different life style the we're not use to.If you read this book you will love it.But guess why it's called Out the Dust?If you read it you will fine out.
0," Out of the Dust: The book ""Out of the Dust"" is decent but leaves out important descriptions of the main characters friends or enemies that form the shape of person that the main character will become. Most of what you know about Billie Jo is that she is long-legged"
1, Intense
0," Its kinda BORING!!!! 4-real!!!!!!!!!!!!: I didn't like it becuz it was boring and it wasnt interesting to me. I would recommend it to a person that likes boring books. I wouldnt recommend it becuz if u wanna read a good book its not ""Out of the Dust"" cuz like I said before its so freakin BORING... LOL but anywayz that is wht I think bout ""Out of the dust"" Well if u read it u well knw wht im talkin bout...LataP.B"
0, ...: Yeah... it's mass marketed because no one buys it (except stupid people). And schools never let you read good books. I mean
0, awful: This book was so incredibly boring! All the book was about was billy jo complining about 1. The dust 2. Her mothers death 3. Her scarred hands and how she wouldnt be able to play the piano 4. more dust 5. The guy she like (which if you ask me was the most pointless part of the story) 6. And did i mention dust!?!?!?! well that was the whole story. Trust me save yourself dont read it.
0," *~Dust Storms In C_Land*~: ""Out of the dust"" was boring i did not like it because it was NOT (FUNNY). It was dumb because all it did was blame billie joe about everything. The book is about a gurl mom & baby bro died. The story at the end was dumb because we dont know what happend to billie joe. IF U LIKE BAD ENDINGS IN BOOKS THE U SHOULD READ THIS BOOK."
1," Into The Dust: I first read this book in a Childrens Literature Course at Arizona State University. From the beginning of the book I was drawn into the story. The style of the writing is what drew me in (almost like a collection of poetry). To take journey into Billie Jo's life and witness her ""real life"" experiences is what makes this book so excellent. Her life events could happen to anyone. This book is so good that I plan on using it as a read aloud/literature study book with my fourth grade students during the spring semester."
1, This is an outstanding book!!: Out of the dust is about a girl named Billy Jo. Her mother dies in a bad accident and she has to learn to live with her father and her own guilt. This story takes place in the dust bowl in Oklahoma in the 1930's. This is a book filled with interesting charectors. If you like sad stories with lots of hope in them than I recomend this book to you.
0, I'm traumitized for all eternity: I couldn't even finish this book. Someone might find it interesting and the only reason why I gave it more than one star is because it's decently well written. It disgusted me though. There was too much giving birth
1, Out of the Dust review from Iroquios middle school: The book out of the Dust is a novel by karen Hesse. This book is about a girl named Billie Jo and her family. Through this book Bille Jo explanes what it is like living in the dust bowl.This book teaches you alot about how the life on a farm during the 1920`s and 30`s in the panhandle during the dust bowl. Even though this book is fiction there is alot true facts in it. The author did alot reaserch to get the facts.I really like that it is written in poem form. It makes the read alot faster and more interesting.I real like the the sections winter of 1934
1, timeless: I read this book about three years ago
1," This DUST book is a MUST book: I thought this book was amazing! It was spectacular how the auther wrote it in her point of view the emmotions were not just ""i was sad"" but instead she would put real emotion into it and i loved the criterea the used the freestyle poem was such a good idea and it turned out great! That is why i gave it four stars."
0, Don't get confused!: Many people have posted on various discussion boards wondering if this is the Christian pop sisters group AURORA. IT IS NOT!...
1, Excellent book
1, Superb and definitely worth more than a one-time read!: This book gives a great insight into the REAL Belgarath
1, Nice back story: I loved the Belgariad and Mallorean so naturally this book is one worth reading. This lays the groundwork for everything set in motion during the two noted series. There are some cyclical ideas in the story telling
1, Cute!: I paired this top with a bright colored cami underneath for a very flattering look! I received compliments all day long!
1, THE BEST TEXT FOR THE BEGINNERS: THE BOOK
1, Excellent reference!: This book starts from the basics and goes to more advanced levels gradually. It reads like a novel- extremely easy to understand. A must for everyone learning calculus or analytical geometry.Many examples/problems are very practical and interesting.
0, Will not last very long: When I first recieved these sheets
0, Burgundy dust comes off the sheets: I bought a set of king burgundy fitted and flat sheets. It looks nice and feels soft and thin. But the very first day I noticed some kind of very fine burgundy color dust coming off the sheets. It gets stuck to sleepwear. White air return vents in my bedroom became almost red in color with this dust. The worst part is that the dust stays on the bed and is very hard to remove it even with a vaccum cleaner. I was careful to wash these sheets separately
1, Awesome Movie: This movie was one of those that I heard about and just had to watch. After a few clips I was sold. This movie has everything!
1, Was pretty good as a med student.: I kept this book with me while on my surgery rotation as a medical student. I also used the Surgical Recall book during that rotation
0, PRICE CHANGE: THE PRICE ON THIS ITEM IN 1/2010 WAS 26.00 ONE YEAR LATER IT IS 50.00 WHAT A JOKE.Racor HFB-2R Double Horizontal Folding Bike Rack with Shelf
1, Great product: Thank you for such a great product. I am very big into fish tanks and this tube allowed me to do a number of things with it. Price was great and delivery was fast.
1, Quit Knocking Things for Being What They Are!!!: So many albums of this type get Bagged-On by Gloomy Gusses who think that all music is supposed to be High Art... Take a Breather! If I had to live with only One Personality living inside me
1, Entertaining and Informative -- Great for Classrooms: This sounds like it might be goofy
0, save your green from this yellow...: save your money. you are better off buying another yellowman cd this one is not 20 hits--more like 4 hits and 16 lame songs.Yellowman is a great dj/toaster and his band is great--but this cd--skip it
1, Sinbad has been getting funnier.: I viewed this DVD with a group of my friends and we were all more than pleased. Sinbad is a side-splitting comic; and the best thing about it
0, Very poor quality: My son really enjoyed this toy
0, Don't waist your money: My husband and I bought this toy for our son for Christmas. WHAT A MISTAKE! Although he likes Chuck
1, Haunting and Beautiful: This is a perfectly beautiful album. This woman is an angel. I hope she will soon give us another CD of her music. Every track here is marvelous
0, Close your eyes and drift away.......: as buying this album will provide you with a piece of music
0, This makes a really good 'Frisbe'.: Heard it all before. Opera and Metal
1, Love it as is!: I love this album as is. I think it sounds about the same as their older stuff. I don't think they have gone downhill. However with losing Tarja
0, 17 used says it all.: This has got to go down as one of the worst albums of 2004. 17 used already up for sale says it all.
1, Porn for gore hounds: No Nudity (except the giant naked zombie mother at the end)Gore off the scale. Most looks fake but some is quite brutal.The movie is silly
1, Still a blast after 20 years!: This is a horror movie but it is not scary in the least. What it is
1, ASTONISHINGLY GORY AND INCREDIBLY FUNNY!! A MUST!!: This incredible film is easily one of
0, Teh Suck: I am sorry
0, Movie review/Video quality: I found the movie to be funny and over the top...however
1, dead alive: this movie totally kicks [butt] the most goreiest movie I have ever seen in a long time. Sorry Jason I think this even has you beat the acting [stinks] but what do you expect from a b grade movie? and also its one of Pete Jacksons first movies more known by the Lord Of The Rings. Dead Allive is a must to in my pesonal opinion.
1," Every Horror-Fan Shoud At Last see it!!!!!: This is a classic!If you like The Evil dead movies you gonna love this.It's a real slasher movie with blood and everything.""This is just like Monty Python Could made a horrormovie"".Pure Slasher"
1," A beautiful collection of pictures and words.: This is a wonderful book. Jim Brandenburg does a superb job of blending words with pictures to tell his story of the wolves of Ravenwood. This book is a definite ""must"" for all wolf lovers!"
0," The worst product ever...: this is the worst dvd/vcr player i have ever had and seen... after couple of months it is not working even though it is ""sony""Dont buy it you will be very dissapointed...P.S 1 Star because i couldnt vote for less.."
0, I HATE this thing.: There have only been a very few things I regret buying my son but this thing definitely tops the list. At first glance
0," Don't blame twenties recording techniques for this one!: This CD is a compilation of tracks from the ""Early Ellington"" multi-disc set"
1," Great Music: The 60's Rock Experience Live is a performance dvd featuring some of the best bands of the 60's performing their hit songs ""LIVE"". The bands included are John Kay & Steppenwolf"
0, Ahhhhgggggg: I got this game because my girlfriend wanted to play it...It continually locked up
0, This Game Hasn't Aged Well: I went back through the original 360 games to see which ones were worth still playing.This game isn't all that bad but lacks in quite a few areas. The story tutorial doesn't guide you through the moves very well. You will be facing challenges needed to level up without any guidance on how to complete them. The characters are very hokey and the dialogue is pretty stiff. The animations are worse as when they talk you can see clear down their throats.If you love Tony Hawk games then this one will probably suit you well. If on the other hand you are a casual gamer and not specifically fan of the genre then dont pick up this game and try one of the 6 others for the 360.
0, Nothing good: Didn't like itI wasn't like the old games that I enjoyed playing. Hard to access different levels. I played it once and now its just sitting in my room.
0, Useful informatioin but real bad explanations: Actually I am editing my oppinion after reading this book almost three times now ... The silly typos and mistakes over the book are a fact
1, gr8: It's a gr8 product
0, Low on content despite page count: This book follows a preview
0, Certain chapters need to be completely rewritten: Avoid this book unless you are prepared to spend 10 times more time on certain chapters than is warranted. It's not the case that the book would be OK if the known errata were corrected; certain chapters have many more errors and faults
0," Revised Edition Still Incredibly Bad: I've been so frustrated with this book that I finally decided to write my first review. It's incredibly hard to read due to the ambiguities and laughable inaccuracies; and this is the ""revised"" copy. I went to the errata link and found that even the most obvious problems were not addressed. For example"
0, Absolute worst...: CD I've purchased. JC Lodge's song was the best. The balance was unadulturated boredom.
0, Don't bother watching this... a waste of time: This is probably the biggest waste of time
0, Really Dull: It's obvious they know the cameras are there
1, Cancun NOT BAD: Well
0, Oracle of the Illuminati: Largely bull. Too much conjecture with nothing to really back it up. This author has a vivid imagination. Should be sold as a piece of fiction.
1, Perfect Tool!: This is a perfect tool for home gardeners. I am using it to deadhead Crepe Myrtles and this well made tool make it so easy I even enjoy using it! Well worth it!!
1, the best: The Corona Clipper I purchased for myself and my 88 yr old Aunti is the best invetion I have in my bucket of yard tools
1, Light Duty Clipper: I needed something to get the branches that were out of reach and this does the job. My arm strength is limited and this is light. It would be nice if it could tackle a little larger branch but it works. The last one I had was a lot less costly and lasted many years. This was a hard to find item
1, Great tool
1, It looks great! Truly!: I loved these movies growing up. When this came out on blu ray
1, Excellent blu-ray transfer: I don't mind paying more for a Disney movie on blu-ray because they always restore their animated classics before putting it on blu ray. It really shows on Rescuers Down Under since it's not as old as the original. Good value.
1, Good movie pack: Great family movie. The first one is kinda of sad. My five year old son cried during the movie because he felt for the little girl. Th second movie was shorter than I thought but still a classic Disney movie.
1, Follow the Stars Home: I loved this book. I'm a sucker for romance but Luanne always seems to add a bit of suspense in her writing.
1, Follow The Stars Home: A most heart warming book. I wish she had followed it through a little more. You really care about these people and want to know how things turned out for them. I'll admit I cried when I read it. I really liked Stella the Cat and Orion the Dog they added some humor to the story.
1, An especially fine audiobook narration by Susie Breck.: Luanne Rice's Follow The Stars Home receives a fine reading by Susie Breck
1, A fine compilation...: One of the only domesticly available Bailey CD's
0, I'm so sorry Perry! It's nothing personal.....: Let me begin by saying I am
1, Perry Mason ROCKS!: My DH's favorite TV show....so of course
0, This paramounts to coercion by Paramount: I guess I will stop my collection at Season 8 Volume 1. I am not paying anymore than $24.95 for any other half season. Remember that we are still in a recession and that we are not stupid. The quality of the Perry Mason show's script went downhill after season 6 anyways
0, Jacket Messed up: Has anyone else noticed that the synopsises of the episodes on the cover don't match the episodes played? High Price and not accurate besides. The titles match but not what happens. Very strange.
0, Very low price reflected in quality of cables: I purchases these cables because of their low price. However i would have been better off with a more expensive HDMI cable that actually functioned. After several days of use
0, Did not work: Did not work when connected directly to the TV from a Roku or XBox 360. Not going to cry about it b/c of the price
0, Don't have it shipped!: I bought it because of the other excellent comparative reviews. Unfortunately it arrived utterly destroyed. Even the foam packing was all in little pieces--all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't help me with this one.
1, Good value for the price: Overall I'm very happy with the brewer. It's easy to use and it cost much less than other high end single cup brewers. Its also fast
0, Don't do it: Don't even think of wasting your money on this CD--it's a complete ripoff. These recordings may be by the original artists
0, Action good-Story bad: It didn't follow the story line that the first two universal soldier movies had created. Even with that aside the story within the movie jumped around and at times was confusing.Now if you just want to see action - gunfire
0, [Two and a half stars out of five] Average from the word go; musclehead Bill Goldberg
0, Awful.Just awful.: Well
0, I feel dumber for having seen this movie...: This is one of those few
0, Ruining the universal soldier tradition..: Man
1, Slow beats
1, Centers
1, I love this
0, Heed the Warnings: This CD is one of their worst.: QR is a band with an exceptional career and legendary albums. _Operation: Mindcrime_ was a stunning and powerful masterpiece
1, The mighty Queensryche is back rockin with Q2K: Q2K rocks!! Geoff Tates vocals are extraordinary. It's amazing that with a new guitarist that they could put out such a kick ass CD. Q2K is much better than HINTF
0, ouch!: Well
0, Without DeGarmo
0," Queensryche's Downward Spiral: After the refreshing ""Hear in the Now Frontier"
1, Very Hot - Their Best Effort To Date: I own all of QR's works
1, live grape: I BOUGHT THIS CD AFTER READING ABOUT MOBY GRAPE IN ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE. THE CD THEY REVIEWED
0, Unreasonable: It is unreasonable that a $4.01 book have a delivery charge of $23.98 added to the order without prior warning. Even more unreasonable is the statement: 'This portion of your order is being prepared for shipment and cannot be canceled or changed.' This statement appeared immediately after the order was placed
1, Great entry level intercom: I was looking for a wireless doorbell
1, Great Game: I purchased this game because I enjoyed Operation Flashpoint thouroughly. This game did not disappoint. From the training missions to the campaigns
1, Adventures in Paradise: As this was the first time I have purchased anything on line I wasn't sure what to expect. Thank you for getting my order out to me so quickly and efficiently its been great especially as I'm laid up with a broken leg.cheers alana
0, thumbs down: These films are a cross between power rangers and three stooges. If you are into that kind of film
1, Powerful
0," Worst ... book ... ever!. And that is saying a lot.: This was the worst thing I have ever had the displeasure of slogging through. Not since high school have I ever labored to finish a book like I did with this one. I don't understand the appeal of this style of writing and the seemingly pointLESS ""stories"" in this book. By the end there are characters just yelling at one another in ALL CAPS for pages and pages. I don't get this book at all. Maybe it's just one of those supposedly *cool* things"
1," A step in the right direction again...: Soilwork is back! After a bit of a step back with the nu-metal scribblings of ""Figure Number Five"""
0, LA Listener wants money back: Glampire's 'Beggining of Terror' was the worst 14 dollars I ever spent. It lacked originality
1, Sayonara: I thought this was a really great book. It tells the story of Major Lloyd Gruver
1, I Can Now See You!: Though I gulped at the total price (including shipping) they are so worth it! When I am on the water these make it possible to actually see whales in the distance instead of just fighting the shake/bounce from the boat movement and the waves. The light is excellent and you can roll down the eye cups for glasses. Unless you are really shaky on land
1, Expensive
1, Distance made close: Excellent product with good dollar value. Excels in magnification
1, Outstanding binoculars: These are really great binoculars for birding. The images are bright and sharp. My only suggestion for improvement would be for Canon to include lens caps for the lenses; caps are included for the eyepieces.
0, Could've been stronger: A pathetically wack jam compared to all other 1960's and 70's P-funk. Get it last.
0, Not a Love for all Time: This book is about Casey Farrow and Dan Murdock. Casey is cosmedics rep who is recovering from a terrible car crash that left her scared and frail. Dan Murdock is the one who ran into the back of her car on a foggy night and pushed her carinto a truck carrying a load of windows. The glass shattered and sent shards of glass over Casey's face and body. DanMurdock pulled Casey from the wreckage and saves her live.From the moment Casey wakes in the hospital Dan is by her side. He tells her that he feels as if they have been togetherin a past life. While this sound romantic

0, Beware of grease!: The frame works well. I needed a frame that supported a headboard and footboard and this fit-the-bill.However
1, Overboard: I thought this book was really good. It's a little slow at the beginning
0, Cheap-o: Classic case (get it? case? har har) of 'you get what you pay for'.Dint expect much from this guy for the price
1, A nice follow up to Bruno's debut album: This album didnt deserve the poor critics it got when it was first released. Actually it sounds good and different than the more popular Return Of Bruno
0, Please consider !!: I gave only green veggie and this product to my baby sulcatas(5 of them) and the result is they all have pyramid shell. I believe that the effect is delay. You wont see the different just 2 weeks after you feed them with this product
1, Notorious is Glorious: When I purchased this disc I was so happy to open the package and pop in the disc into my system. The sounds that came out the album and single til this day haunt me. It's like listening to someone that is still alive. With this album 
1, Great Book: This is a great book by Golf's greatest player. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game of golf.
1, So Easy to Use: I have had my mp3 player for a couple of weeks. I love it! It was so easy to load my CD's onto it and so easy to use while jogging. I reccommend it.
1, Which is more valuable
0, Accordian Crimes Disappoints: Accordion CrimesI looked forward to reading this book as I had enjoyed The Shipping News so much. This was an extreme disappointment. It became very tedious and I found myself skimming large passages in the latter chapters. Also
0, Boring and frustrating: The premise sounded interesting: following the accordian through a series of owners from all walks of life. But the characters were extremely uninteresting. I didn't mind the book's darkness
0, A long and rambling tale that loses the reader: While the beginning of E. Annie Proulx's novel
0," So anxious to read this - but gave up twice.: Annie Proulx's ""The Shipping News"" is one of my favorite books. A story so sharply written that I've held simple phrases in my head for years - unforgettable. I was thrilled to hear about ""Accordian Crimes"" and even broke my wait-until-it's-in-paperback rule. Forked over the bucks for the hardcover and took an afternoon off from work to dive in. Well - such a laborious"
0, DO NOT buy these as sealing (crush) washers: I purchased these because I was building the brakes on my project car and figured I'd use these throughout as crush washers. BIG mistake! The quality is terrible - every washer has a little burr edge all the way around and not all are truly flat. I'm not sure what they're intended for but it's certainly not fluid sealing as crush washers. I ended up buying washers at 5x the cost at my local car store
0, Compelling yet difficult to read through because of poor edi: A compelling view of bible prophecy that was difficult to read through because of extremely poor editing that increasingly distracted from the book's content. Don't publishers proofread anymore?
1, Great for initial learning of instruments...: As a student of Surgical Technology
1, One of the best books
1, Would shop again!: The book was in great condition
0, not very good: i was very dissapointed
0," Really bad: I agree with most of the other people that posted. This game is a straight run and gun game with no planing or strategy. Hell most of the time your team seems to be there to serve as another target for your enemy. The AI sucks badly most ""breach bang and clear"" strategies seem to fail most of the time. Also you only get one squad instead of 3"
1, Great watch: This is a good looking watch that works very well. It doesn't all the features that I never use
1," A Hidden Treasure: I found ""Plumb"" in a stack of CDs that my college radio station was giving away to make room in its library. This is comparable to finding a Renoir at a yard sale. Brooke's voice"
1, good phone: This phone works very well. I have simple needs in a phone and this suits those needs. It's sleak and modern.
0, Big Disappointment: I bought this phone in 2007 for work purposes as I work from home with a separate line. The DECT 6.0 was a big influence on my purchase decision. My biggest complaint is that it does not hold a charge at all. This is not just annoying but embarrassing as I use it for work. It used to give a warning beep at least when the battery was running low but now just cuts off. I now can barely use it for 1/2 hour at a time. It doesn't make me look professional to say the least. Any attempted use of speakerphone results in sudden death. The sound quality is not great and I have actually had interference from another person's call on the line once (I am also using Vonage for this line so I'm not sure if that's the phone's fault?! I thought that's what DECT was for though). I've ordered the replacement battery and if that doesn't sort it out will be replacing it but I'm not impressed with vtech based on this. Sounds like a known fault with this phone and I hate waste!
1, Best cordless I have ever used: The sound quality is very
0, VTech 6032 DECT 6.0 Cordless: The phone is great as far as sound quality. However the battery life is terrible. Also there is no battery life indicator to let you know when its low. You can see a battery icon only while the phone is on the charger. Even then it doesn't indicate full or low. Only that its charging. It dies after being off the charger for only 12 hrs. Talk time is like 2.5 hrs. I just returned it. Uniden is much better for battery life.
0, Battery won't hold charge at all.: When i first got the phone
1, Well worth your time!: We bought the letter E in order to scavenge it for spare parts since one day the N we had bought for our son was mysteriously (I think the vacuum got it) missing one of the two pairs of wheels. The E that arrived was dark brown not green like the picture shows
1," Dee's Widowmaker: After the demise of Twisted Sister came this outing by Dee Snider. This album I feel was largely overlooked. It has a more straightforward hard rock feel with some blues mixed in than that of the final ""Love is for suckers"" album by Twisted Sister.The music laid down by Al Pitrelli and co. is sonically harmonious to Dee's vocal style so it fits very well. If I were to recommend to you an album by Widowmaker"
1, Highway Robbery: Shame on all the booksellers selling this ten dollar book for $75 and up!Devorss is re-publishing this book in August!I took note of the sellers AND WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM!

1," ""Darknessess""...a great follow up to book 1"
1, best of the three: first time i ever heard mono
0, Painful to Watch!: This movie was just painful to watch. What's entertaining about a compulsive liar with (what is likely) a personality disorder? It MIGHT have been funny
1, good story; why no extras?: This was a good based-on-a-true-story kind of film
0, The Informant: Personally found this to be one of the worst movies ever. Very boring
0," Wanted to like it . . . but just couldn't: I wanted to like this movie. I usually like Matt Damon movies and I know one of the agents this movie is about. I was really looking forward to seeing this. The problem is the movie just can't decide whether it is a serious piece covering the very interesting true story of an informant with huge problems of his own or whether it is a comedy or a spoof. It does a poor job of being funny and a poor job of being serious. Another reviewer called the movie ""quirky."" That is a good description"
1, Compact if a bit on the sparse side: I guess I can't complain given the compact size of this chart but I rather quickly outgrew it. Very good for learning the general constellations and locating all the major landmarks in the sky.
1, Good Hose!: I bought this to replace a leaky vinyl line i had. So far so good. And who doesn't love Stainless??
1, Exactly what I needed!: This was exactly what I needed. I had it connected immediately after receiving it in preparation for my new refrigerator.
1, BUCK: I used to really enjoy Buck Owens and Roy Clark on Buck's TV show. Don't hear much of Buck's recordings on the radio these days and I thoroughly enjoyed playing his songs
1, The Who Who's Better Who's Great: This is a great album it has all of the good songs on most of the albums it is Better And Best
1, Fantastic Book: What were these three sisters doing to produce such great books in such short lives? This book is ahead of its time

1, great for all ages: My three year old grandson just loves these videos. It is all he ever watches. He knows them by heart now and can tell you just what is going to happen before it does. Can't wait to get the lastest two videos in this series. Very happy with all the Mist movies.
1," classics: House of Seven Gables was mandatory reading in high school. I have been out of school for many years and have been reading the ""classics"" again. I am enjoying them so much. I will be adding this to my Grandchildren's library and who knows someday they may enjoy these books as much as I have. pb"
1, I used this book in Organizational Managment class.: I am an adjunct instructor in a business college of a university in the midwest. My students were given this book as an option for a required or an extra credit review. Of the 84 students
0, By the pink-toed prophet...: ...I really didn't like this book. I read alot of the success/motivational type books (see my reviews of various Brian Tracy books
0, Sorry but I don't get it: I just don't get it. Its a quick read
1, the Go Getter: Inspirational. Though difficult to understand at the beginning but read through a couple time and it make more sense each time. Not to difficult to do since its only 30 pages!!!
1, Persistance - a true virtue for success: The story included in this book is one that each of us will confront more than once in our worling lifetime. The fact that a positive attitude for accomplishment of a task will bring fulfillment in both your work and your life. I have given this book to my salesforce and to many friends that let little obstacles halt their pursuit. God made us with a free-will and we should expect that our using that gift will please both Him and us. A must read for all that I know and love.
1, the best: this stater is actually 20 percent stronger and last longer ive had it in my bike over a year now and as soon as i put it in i felt it had more power im bout to buy an extra one and sell this for more
0, Read It While I was Waiting . . .: I actually read this book while I myself was waiting - in a hotel in Guatemala to meet the son I was to adopt! Like most of the other reviewers
1, An Old Wine in the New Bottle: Realistic
1, Waiting: A journey into dreams and reality: Ha Jin has written an eloquent story of longing and the effects it has on ones own reality. This story flows with grace
1, Graceful storytelling: The prose is straightforward
0," Still ""Waiting"".......: Who got paid off to grant this award? I kept waiting for the plot to develop or for any sign of life in this story and none turned up. I forwarded it to my sister to see if I was missing something and she thought it was a waste of time as well. When there are so many other excellent books out there and only a limited time in which to read them I wouldn't waste a second reading this book"
0, Price does not always get you the best: I paid the close this absurd price for this chair b/c of the reviews and b/c I have to spend lots of time in it. Within months the pneumatic device started failing. Today it failed completely. The closest location to make the repairs needed - replacing the device - is about 30 miles from my home and will cost about $100 plus labor. There are many excellent office/desk chairs on the market now and with the economy what it is
1, Country Life Bone Density Factors: I have been using this product for the last 5 or 6 years. A bone density test had shown a slight bone loss and my doctor advised taking calcium supplements. The owner of a health food store advised me to try Country Life Bone Density Factors. My next bone density test about 18 months later showed that I no longer had any bone loss. At that time
0, Waste of ink: Anyone interested in Philosophy will not learn from this book. This book misrepresents every single philosophical system from Aristotle to Nietzsche. The facts put forward by the book
0, Amateur fan-boy hour!: If you're a fan of movies that try to revisit the past without any creative edge with horribly predictable plots you've found a treat. The 80's have come and gone
0, The worst movie to rule them all!: Upon reading these reviews I was excited to see this movie. Every time I've seen the movie on the shelf at my local movie rental
1, Gave Me the Willies: I decided to watch
0, THE MOVIES ARE GETTING WORSE: WHY DO PEOPLE WATCH THESE THINGS? EVENTUALLY SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE HEART FAILUREAND I THOUGHT JASON OR FREDDY WAS BAD THE MOVIES SINCE THE 80'S ARE GOING WAY BEYOND SCARE WHY DO THE WRITERS HAVE TO SCARE THE LIFE!!! OUT OF PEOPLE
0, Did I watch the same movie as the other reviewers???: All of the long winded positive reviews for this dull
0, House of Please Something Happen: Everyone said this movie was a throwback to the horror films of the 80's
1, Season 6 -- A New Era: I think the show really peaked during seasons 3
1, Good But Violent: I liked this book a lot but I thought it was very violent like when the teenagers were hacking each other to death with hatchets and I didn't like the fact that Robin Fear kills all the people for like no reason at all. Well
0, Danger! Do not buy.: I saw this software in Staples and thought I would give it a try.Utter waste of time. I have a workstation with the latest specs. I installed Total 3D and spent alot of time inputting my stuff only to do a walk through and see no walls
0, Don't buy this if you have a 250: The title says Virago V-Twins but it only contains the 550s and up. I have a 2001 250 and there is no information on my bike in this book.
0, Do not buy: I bought this mp3 player because1) It's a Sony2) It has at least 1gb of storageI'm returning this mp3 player because1) No belt clip or arm band2) Battery cover does not stay on3) Froze the first day I used it4) Does not have 1gb storage

0, Bad overall
0, Get it right!! Liberals are not social controllers!: I am fed up with this misappropriation of a perfectly good word
1," Entertaining...: I have pretty much the same impression about this book as I have about Rush Limbaugh's ""The Way Things Ought to Be""--Boortz is entertaining and makes some good points"
1, This will open your eyes regardless your political view.: This author is a Libertarian and regardless your political pursuasion this book will give you something to think about. It gives great insight into libertarian thinking. Whether you agree with this man or not you will come away with a better understanding of the political motivation behind some of our hottest political issues and a desire to learn more.
0, OK
0, Why pay for it?: Why pay for something you've already heard for free. This non-rational aspect of markets is but one of many realities that this libelous
1, Tells it like it is: Great analysis of how liberals think. It's good to understand the differences in how people of this kind think. Liberalism was once a good thing for everyone
0," er...: Quote from Westlife interview :""We're really suprised we've got this far as last year we were still in education and didn't know anything about music""Music is made by artists who care about what they do.

1, Fantastic: Do yourself a favor and buy this stand. In my opinion this is the most perfect flat panel stand you can currently buy on the market. When it arrived it was extremely easy to put together and the overall quality of the assembled product matches it's great looks. It effortlessly holds a Denon receiver
1," Great Home for my HDTV: I have my 37"" LCD TV in a fairly small living room so I considered wall mounting"
1, Good enough: It's a large
1, Successful replacement: Product arrived in a timely manner
0, Warranty is unreliable and poor customer service: My Belkin went bad and the plastic began burning. I smelt the burning plastic before it burned down my house. I filed a claim and sent the Belkin surge protector back and never heard anything from them --not even a little postcard that my claim had been denied.

1, A great book for any martial arts person: The collection of stories are so inspiring to keep with martial arts training.
1, Another Hit!: I'm a huge fan of this series and can tell you that it is one of the best around. It was nice to see the action shift to New York. As usual the characters are well written and the story moves along. I love Elvis' sense of humor. Working my way through the series. I know that the latest one is about Joe Pike so that should be great. Pick this up
1, Robert Crais is my new favorite!: If you love suspense

0, Very attracttive phone but very poor range.: I am very disappointed with the range for this phone. I am unable to walk around my home and have a conversation on the phone because I get cut off then get a message OUT OF RANGE.I have used cordless phones that cost less than $50 that has more range than this phone.I wish I could get my money back so that I purchase the radio shack two line cordless.
0, TRU 8866 5.8GHZ 2 line cordless phone: I Just recieved this new phone. Features & Audio Quality are very Good. There is a little bit of echo as described by other Buyers. But my biggest complaint is the range. I only get about 40-50 ft. at best before this phone starts breaking up. Verydissapointed in the range of it in my house. My old uniden 900 SST went a block in a half for rang. This phone barely makes it out to my back Yard. If all the new 5.8 GHZ. are this way
0, Terrible Speakerphone: I have this phone and have had it for 3-4 months; I find the speaker phone to be terrible. I find that the volume cuts in and out and people cannot hear you and you cannot hear people. The problem is that this is inconsistant so on some calls it works fine but on most it does not. If you are looking for a good cordless phone

1, Jabra Earset: I ordered this for myself on a Monday and received it on a Wednesday. I took it home that night and my mother-in-law loved it! I had to order another one for myself on Thursday morning. This is a great asset to the cell phone user. It's GREAT! It comes with small/med/large ear pieces for the left/right ear and the button in the middle is great because as a call comes in all you have to do is press the button to begin the call and press again to end. I highly recommend this.
1, Good idea... best for heat!: The back pack is a great idea
1, More like Texan drawl: The story was good but the voice patter was off. Tressa sounded more like she was from Texas or Oklahoma than Iowa. Too many aw shucks type sayings.
0," Lots of ""ear candy"". Not much meat in the story: Jayne's comments were too cutesy. I didn't have much sympathy for her. It's not my type of story. I'm just learning about my Kindle"
1, Like the character: I liked the character of Calamtiy Jayne though I don't think I could take anymore of her adventures by reading more books as it would get into the annoying stage.
0, That is not a photo of the Marketts on the cover: I have a copy of this album and this is not a photo of the Marketts. It is probably knock-off of the original album release on KRB. If it does not say KRB as the manufacturer
1, Convenience: This is an excellent product. Easy to set up. It makes life more convenient
0, Battery life is poor.: Battery life is terrible. They need a lithium ion battery for this phone. Get out of the old technology.
1, Mines been fine!!: I can sympathize with the people who have had battery problems
0, worst phone I ever bought: This has to be the worst phone I ever bought. This was my first time trying a panasonic phone and I have to say I will not be buying a panasonic brand telephone again. The battery will not stay charged more then 1-2 days. Forget using speaker phone because it will drain the battery life to none. This phone is not worth the money. Its not even worth the 1 star rating.
0, Worst Phone I ever encountered on this planet: This is the worst phone i have ever seen in my whole life. The battery dies after talking only 2 minutes.We have the same problem with the base set and 3 other handset.NEVER BUY THIS ONE..

I run a business from my home and want to be able to talk to my customers for more than 15 minutes without the phone dying and with this phone that can't be done! I have changed batteries
1, So many features: I have to agree that the battery life leaves a little more to be desired. I bought the system
0, Battery life terrible: Everything is fine with this phone / system except battery life. Ugh. I've owned it less than a year and I'm going to buy another phone system today because I'm sick of terrible battery performance.
0, Standard fare: Let's see

1, Great buy for the price: I was very pleased with the product for the price I paid. It was easy to use and the picture quality was good for my use. Granted
1, Great picture frame: I bought this for my husband for our anniversary. He has been looking at these frames for months. I was worried at first that it would not be good because of the price
0, Double image & no tech support: The picture has a mirrow image over lap giving it a double image. Coby does not answer email and their automated phone answering system hangs up on you after 5 minute wait.
1, scan disc: I would have thought that it would have come with some type of scan disc or larger internal memory! But all in all it is a very good buy!!!
0, coby digital picture frame: This product did not work from the moment I plugged it in. I am in the process of trying to return it
0, Instructions needed: I purchased this digital photo a frame as a gift. The plan was to download pictures and music stored on our computer to the frame.

0, Terrible phone: I have this phone and its the worst as far as battery life.I thought buying a extra handset would help but that battery life is just as bad.they tell you talk time is so many hours
0," Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money buying this book if you already know how to put peanut butter on a stalk of celery. It has a few useful recipes but most of it is just filler. I found Krimmel's other book ""The Low Blood Sugar Handbook"" to be helpful but unless you wish to let hypoglycemia rule your life as Mr. Krimmel does look for something else. I would recommend the Insulin Resistance Diet for anyone who wishes to maintain a normal life not ruled by low blood sugar."

1," ++++++ stars this cd ROCKS!: when i heard the first single off of the punisher soundtrack i was like holy sh-t these guys are back in a big way the punisher song was censored but this one is not on the cd. this cd from start to finish grabs you buy the throat and doesn't let go until you sing or shout all of the choruses to each song i haven't stopped listing o the cd it is awesome. the new singer sounds like the old man they are so similar but the new singer is awesome i don't know what he's doing in the studio to make his voice sound so powerful but he has a strong a-- voice. all i got to say is pick up this album and crank it loud and proud and YOU TO WILL BE be singing ""WHAT WHO WHERE WERE YOU? WHEN I WAS DOWN ON MY LUCK YOU KNOW YOU NEVER GAVE A FU-K!"
1, Great deep tracks from a talented British band ! !: If you liked Joe Cocker with the Grease Band
1, kicks scotts' butt: Love it! Coming from scotts deluxe edge guard this is a solid stable pusher. I put several 40 bags of lime out over my acre lawn in no time (1 bag at a time). bumps were handled easily. hills no problem
0, Cheaply constructed Impeller: I bought this Spreader hoping upgrade from the standard Scott's speader. I used it once in the spring and then went to use it in September and the wheels would turn. Upon further investigation I noticed that the Impeller warped and was hitting the body of spreader preventing the wheels from turning. I bent the impeller
1, Mingus: Just buy it
1, A great story. (easy to listen to in the car): I was looking for a quick reader for a book report and came upon this one. I got it to listen to for an easy way out
0, Jazz? No jazz-ish.: You'll be seeing countless copies of this CD (and all of Ms. Krall's other work) in used CD stores across this nation for decades to come.
0, From a woman: It is sitting in my cd rack but it was not my idea to buy this album. I do not understand why artists that cannot come out with their own songs have such a great success. At least
0, what's the fuss about?: I followed the hype and bought it. Big mistake. Hellooooo there! Not only is it painfully academic
0, the look of love: A travesty
0, Uninspired Easy Listening: Diana Krall is a talented vocalist
0, Boring: Diana Krall's impeccable musicality can only take a listerner so far before ennui takes over. If there's a missing ingredient in her musical persona
0, Boring and Pretentious.: She has a great voice. It's time for her to start doing some music of her own
1, The Look of Love: She has done it one more time. Another great musical experiance from the brightest star in jazz today. Diana covers alot of standards in her own way. Her versions of Cry Me A River
0, Looks like success has ruined Diana Krall: I heard her in concert a few months ago. She was great. Where have the hard driving piano improvs and innovative swinging vocals gone? 'The Look of Love' is very little jazz (mostly pop) with maple syrup poured all over it. I hope it didn't ruin my CD player!
0, What a disappointment!: If you're a major Diana Krall fan
0, Implausible historical characters
1, If you have never used one of these
1," Even the baby loves it!: This is by far our very favorite and most requested kids CD that we own! Even the baby(who is 11 mo.)likes to keep up with Buzz Buzz. My son who is 4 is the official owner of the CD but the minute my daughter and her friends get in the car they start chanting ""LORI HAS A PIG ON HER HEAD!"" enough said? I cannot say enough good things about this album and it is WELL worth every penny."
1, Big hit: I got this for my 2 year old
0, Not what I was expecting...: considering the hype. This is too sappy and lightweight for our tastes. Children's music
1, My kids can't get enough of this CD: We borrowed this from the library. It has been a hit. Even my 17 month old is singing along to parts of the songs in the car.
0, Avoid this prudish edition resurrected from 1932: Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations

0, No wow factor: I have nothing against Josh. He has a good voice
1, I ADORE HIM: I've loved Josh's music since I first heard him on the radio then on the Concert for World Children's day about a year and a half ago. His first CD was great
1, Josh Groban has a magnificent voice....: Every since I first saw Josh Groban on Ally McBeal
1, Excellence: After hearing Josh Groban's first cd
1," Absolutely Amazing!: Josh Groban's new CD is nothing short of amazing. I'm the type of person that will listen to a CD by changing tracks constantly... never quite satisfied in entirety by any single album. ""Closer"" has given me reason to change my ways. It is a diverse compilation of dynamic songs and a wonderful blend of genres. Since receiving it"
0, Why would you listen to this?: This is dentist office music. I had the unfortunate experience of having a root canal while listening to this no talent hack.
1, Closer to.....: hm..what can you say about Josh Groban? He is a tremendously talented young man who knows what works best with his voice. Granted
1, Great Voice: I think he has a great voice
1, What a talent!!!!!!!: This is an amazing CD! I do not think there is one song on this that I do not enjoy listening to. WoW! In fact it is so good I am sending it as a gift to the rest of the family! If you love Andrea Boccelli then you will melt when you hear Josh Groban. Track 10 is my absolute favorite! Great BUY!
1, The Oregon Trail in 1851: This was a grand book. I have read many books on the Oregon Trail. This one rates right up at the top. My family were pioneers who came to Oregon later
1, A great introduction to the vibrant Canadian Celtic scene: This album provides a wonderful introduction to some of the many sadly neglected (at least in the U.S.) musicians of Eastern Canada. The Chieftains have wisely chosen to bring the guest artists front and center while limiting their own contribution. The result is a wide variety of styles and sounds
0, Ugh: I was immensely disappointed. This could have been so much better... Damon was an obsessive
1, DataShark 70003 Universal Cable Stripper/Cutter: Works just fine for cutting/stripping ethernet. Only go around once.

0, Death Comes to the Archbishop: Very difficult to read text in this book. Spaces between word were missing very often
1, Quality melodic hard rock: I don't know that New York band Wild Horses (not to be confused with the UK band of the same name) qualifies as an all-star group
1, Campus Hot!: I'm finding college students all over campus readig this. I see why. It's an excellent story with superior writing!
1, Couldn't put this book down!!!!: Diane Chamberlain does it again! The first book of hers that I read was Keeper of the Light and I was delighted to find she hasn't lost her touch. Great book! I couldn't sleep until I finished reading it!
1, Another winner from Diane Chamberlain: I only recently started reading books by Diane Chamberlain and this was my 3rd. So far
1, LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!: This is my 5th book by Diane Chamberlain and it is my favorite to date. The storyline is so unique and the characters pull you in from page one. I didn't want this book to end! Definitely a must read!!!

0, Norton Save & Restore [Old Version]: Norton Save & Restore [Old Version]~ Windows - Too complex and potentialy unreliable for saving and restoring files. Sorry to have purchased it. I've installed and worked with many programs for many years. Too many programs in the Norton Save & Restore that can go wrong in the computer operating system. An external drive with a back-up program can do the same job without the potential problems.

0, Disappointed: I purchased this awhile back. I must say that I'm really disappointed with it. I was hoping for something to use to avoid using the expensive pods all the time. The main problem with this is that the Senseo will not shut off automatically. It makes a mess each time I attempt to use it. The coffee is very weak and usually has some grounds in it. Also there is no crema
0, Makes very WEAK coffee: The presto my pod makes
0, Doesn't fit: This was advertised as fitting my pod machine
1," Sherlocks brother Mycrofts adventure: The story line is Fast paced and interesting. Though having Mycroft Holmes ( Sherlock's brother). Traveling about .Does not agree with his image. Of being "" exact in his ways.And not one to exert himself ....other than crossing the street from his dwelling to the Diogenes Club. And Sherlock is not a active party in this adventure.

1, Great Deal: I got these for my wife as a Valentines gift and they are beautiful. I see no blemishes and it sparkles. 1/2 cttw was a good size as her first set of diamond earings. Fast shipping and bought them during the 40% off sale. We are both completely happy with the purchase.

1, a meeting with the music: you will find that many sounds take your mind away!. A magic moment with Stevie.
1," ""My Favorite Album Of All Time"": For me to be able to review and share my love for music is such an opportunity. Stevie has always been a ""prophet"" through music. Only those capable of feeling the lyrical content will understand the true purpose for Stevie's music. ""INSPIRATIONAL"". Words can't express the way I feel about this project. It still inspires me! We must continue to express our ""INNERVISION"". peace and love"
1, Stevie Wonder is a genius!: The project is musically creative!The project is vocally asthetic!The songs take the listener on a rhythmically thoughtful excursion that few of today's contemporary artists could hope to match!
0, book: Didn't care for book (story) after I received it. Was used for a book club read. We are picky readers.
1, An inventive and enjoyable read.: There was little I didn't like about this book. It kept me guessing
0, Don't believe the hype: I read this on a recommendation because of my love for Fight Club. I don't think the comparison is fair and I found myself bored from start to finish. The prose is dense and colorful
1, Excellent and Contemporary: Lethem is in a rare class of contemporary writers. His work enfolds you into a time period in Brooklyn
0, ...about an outcast
1, thank you
1, Yes: This is the best little hidden treasure ever. This used to play at Abercrombie & Fitch when I worked there and I couldn't find it anywhere. Here it is! Totally worth the few bucks.
0, A big comic book!: I was TOTALLY disappointed with this book. When I received it
0, Absolutely No Good!!!: Thumbs down all the way.I bought this and had to return it within a week. I have used many GPSs Different brands and models and this is the worst.It was constantly hanging
1, Notorious by 5 After 4: Vito Rezza is one of the finest and most creative drummers in the world
0, For knowing principles of female business attire: Molloy has something different to say than most professional apparel advisors. His theme is to stick with power projection as based on research. Decision points involve color
0, NO Photos!!: It's hard to believe there is no photos at all for a book on women's dress! disappointed. No comarison can be found for what is a preferrable style. More like a narrative telling type of work.
1, This book is exactly what it says it is: I don't mind others being against this book -- they're just less competition for those of us who understand the corporate unconscious. I read this book AFTER becoming successful by doing the things this book recommends. Lucky me. Then
1, Work for me: Having a baby face
0, This book is full of untruths and sexism: I would not recommend this book ladies! Molloy wants to makethe rules for women but I suggest women make the rules for themselves.Also
1, Almost Perfect: A very well made sword. Excelent balance. However there is a minor flaw in the finish on both sides of the blade. Not enough to cause me to return it
1, Funky 70s gem: The kid was just 21 when he made this in 1972
0, Sometimes catchy
0, Flat Tire for the Road movies: A disappointment. Although the author deservedly credits Dorothy Lamour as an important part of the star combo for this series
0, Availbility of Consumables is Terrible: I bought this printer and it ran fine for a month. Then the photo-conductor had a problem. Support indicated they would ship a replacement and I would be a happy camper. Now 4 weeks have passed by and the part has not shown up. I called them repeatedly and was always told that it would ship in the next 2 days. Finally I got fed up and thought I would just go out and buy it. And guess what
0, Heard it all before
1," Talking Book still sounds fresh today: Stevie the Wonder's breakthrough album from 1972. The classic "".... Sunshine Of My Life"" leads off but then we run into ""Maybe Your Baby"" which I find hard going. The rest of side one is fine and side two is consistently excellent. Getting Jeff Beck to play on ""Lookin' For Another Pure Love"" was a masterstroke. Due mainly to the deterioration of the vinyl (why?)"
0, problems with information.: To whoever looks
0, wrong sound clips: Not sure what lovely choral singing is loaded for playback in the preview
0, Sadly
1, Great Stuff: This set is quite powerful. Sun Ship and Amen show the classic quartet in all their blazing power while Dearly Beloved and Attaining show just how beautiful creative jazz can be.I give this album a lower rating for Garrison's solo for a large part of Ascent. Coltrane always gave Garrison space and should be admired for doing so. Unfortunately

0," Most unreliable name brand tool I have ever purchased.: I purchased this drill instead of a Milwaukee to save a few dollars and because I read that Bosch hammer drills are superior. I drilled less than 50 holes ranging in size from 5/16"" to 1/2"" before it died abruptly......no smoke"
0," quit on my second job: I was drilling 3/4"" dia holes 2 inches deep in concrete to install a pool cover when the drill just died.

1," Chinese language study: This book has no ""frills"" with it. It is simply short readings in Chinese that have helpful vocabulary. I would not recommend it without a class or teacher but with a good teacher it is a very useful book."

1, 1000 stars: If you're a heavy metal fan
0," Junk Hieroglyphics: Sorry this book is not for the serious student. As an Egyptologist I would recommend Gardiner's ""Egyptian Hieroglyphics"""
1, IF YOU MISS THIS
1, This is music to bring back memories: The calm and soothing interplay of saxaphone and voice is something rare today. The notes are faultless as you might expect with Coltrane but the synergy between the singer and musician is so good that one is continually surprised by the soft and very touching pleasantness of what they do together.

1, erotic fantasy: i got exactly what i payed for... it fit well and me and my boyfriend have really enjoyed it. haha thank you!
0, How can this book called a classic?: I had to read this book for school and in my opion the book is not in any way enjoyable or outstanding. It is supposed to be about a young boy maturing but the few changes that happen to him in extent of about two years are subtle and unimportant. He does learn about death although through the red pony (why is that the title of the book when the pony is only mention in the first two chapters then forgotten?). This book merely sleeps along drifting slowly and clumsily between chapters. It would have been much better if it went more into depth of the little boy's parents' and grandfather's history. Why Gitano
0, Are you a teacher or a parent? Here is some advice...: I do not think this is a good thing for kids to be reading. How people can find this a great book... unless they have a likng for revolting things... I do not understand. Example from The Red Pony- Steinbeck describes how a boy mushes a vultures head 'til it's a red pulp... and cutting the horses throat 'til the mucus comes out in a stream. Do you really want your kids or students reading this? I warn you... if you don't like revolting things
0, sucks: SUCKS BIG BANANAS.... the book should never be read again
0, I've seen deeper depths more interestingly covered !: This book is horrible and is extremely dull. It was absolutely the longest 95 pages of my life. I am now reading James Agee's A Death in the Family and I love it. It keeps you hanging
0, I wish I had never come in contact with this waste of ink.: I feel sad for the trees that had to give their their life for this book to be printed. It is a complete waste of ink and paper not to mention time. If I hadn't had to read this book for school
1, Opened me up to more great works by Steinbeck: This is a great first book for young readers who want to open their minds to deeper literature. I read it in the 6th grade (first time) and it prompted me to read more and more Steinbeck. I still enjoy his work
0, I would rather eat my toenails than read this book again.: This is the worst book I've read in my life. Don't get me wrong
1, What type of dimwits are these people?: It is pretty sad to see these simpletons come on here and give what they think is some type of clever review of this great book. It is also disturbing that these readers can't look deeper than the shallow depths of their simple minds. The Red Pony is one of they best books I ever read
0, semi satisfying: Like so many of Steinbeck's other novels
0, Not a child's book: I first picked up this book as a child
0, The Red Pony: I really didn't care too much for The Red Pony. It might be interesting for some people
1, Very useful tool
1, Scangauge does what I needed: I needed this gauge to read my voltage and coolant temp. and it does it fine. The readout is a little small and hard to read under some face colors. I use a white background and that seems to work. If I match it to my dash color
1, Super easy to use: The scanguage has been a very satisfying purchase
1," Track-bed: This stuff helps in your layout if you are using ""regular"" tracks"
1, A Fascinating Book That You Never Get Tired of Reading: I found this to be one of the most fascinating and interesting books I have ever read. Flip the book open to any page and learn the history of everyday things we take for granted.How were Band-Aids invented? When toilet paper was first invented
1, Disspelling myths: Actually this book tears down many myths (including the idea that a man named Crapper invented the toilet). As for Versailles

1, McCoy Gives justice to the compositions of Burt Bacharach: I thought this was a wonderful calaboration of song writer and musician. Both are top quality

1, Great Word Puzzle Game: I'm probably one of the few people who love this game
1," Great game - almost as good as tv show: This game is great - teaches spelling and good sportsmanship. A lot of fun (and fun to watch the ""player's"" reactions when they get something right or wrong! Great family game :)"
0, Guesses: all religion is based on guesses
1, Home is Where the God Is: I stumbled upon this book in a used bookstore
1, Life Altering: I don't want to rehash what's been said above but I do agree with most of it. What I want to add is that the book says as much about living as it does about dying! In my case
1, Great read: This is the first book I've read on my kindle paper white. It has been a great experience. Many of the ideas I this book are found in ancient texts from the Eastern traditions. But the tone is light and you feel like the author and God are engaging in a very ordinary conversation. The ideas are not mainstream but they confirm and clarify my own. Life and death are heady subjects and this is a refreshing approach. Who knows what death will ultimately be
0, A liitle old
1, Indian Red plate set: We have been looking for supplements to the few Spode Indian Red plates that we have. I was over joyed not only to find them on Amazon (I usually have only used Amazon for books)but to find them at a reasonable price. On arrival they were well packed
1, Nice plates
0, disapointing: I thought time out of mind was the best album in 10 years.I have tried to listen to this several times and I think it is terrible
1, IT'S THE BALLS!!!!: THOUGHT I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AGAIN WATCHING AMERICAN BANDSTAND ON THE TUBE. JUST LOVE THOSE SUMMER DAYS.
1, An excellent album: There is not a bad song on this album
1," Po' Boy? - I think not!: Perhaps more brilliant than ""Self Portrait"". Quite arresting in fact. Enjoy my dear ""Dylanies""."
1, Honest to goodness
1, I don't know what people are complaining about...: I think this is one of Dylan's better CD's in the past two decades. Why people are complaining about his voice is beyond me. It's deeper
1," Give This Time: Its hard to follow up a great record like ""Time Out Of Mind"""
0, Bleah!: This is my first attempt at reading PK Dick. This book tried hard to be _something_... and I tried hard to find out _what_... but the experience left me with a headache and a vague nausea. I'm going to try another of his books
0, Avoid anything Valis related from PKD: I love much of PKD's writing

1, the best book currently in the market: this book has been with me for the last 8 yrs.i like this book as all the info is imparted with the minimum usage of words
0, Beginning ESL- Not!: Lower level ESL? I would love to know what the writers of the book title views as intermediate level. I teach lower level ESL adults. Lower level means the students struggle with all words and the meanings of those words. We are working on mastering words such as : next to
1, Thoughtful
1, The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read: This was indeed the best book I've ever read. It gave interesting descriptions of savage native life and of life at sea during the time. Ahab was a perfect portrayal of a man blinded by revenge. He will go to any price to get it
0," ""Call me disapointed and Call him confused"": Yeah that's right. I got to be honest"
0, Kindle edition is not Norton Critical Edition - NOT A BOOK REVIEW!: The Kindle edition linked to on this product page is not the Norton Critical Edition.All you get is a version with biographical information.This review is not about Moby Dick
0, Missing front pieces: Melville's book is astounding
0, Tedious: I would recommend getting the abridged version. There is too much detail into so many unnecessary aspects of whaling. I wouldn't recommend it as a book you 'must read before you die'.
0, Call me bored: Improve my reading material
1, love it: great reading
0, Help I need some water: What a terribly dry book. I cannot concieve how this book has become a classic. The author could not have written a more boring book.The action is slow if existant at all
0, Why must we all be forced to read this?: Sure
0, There's a reason why this book is out of print: A majority of the important action is related in flashback style or one character telling another what happened. Rather annoying. Olivia is so caught up in her own troubles
0," Disapointing sequel: After the grand passion and depth to the characterisation in ""Olivia and Jai"" the tale of the next generation seems dull. The plot moved slower"
1, Brilliant 1st collaboration: Brilliant 1st collaboration of Dan Fogelberg and jazz-flutist Tim Weisberg with the hit song The Power of Gold on the album aswell. Excellent musicianship. worth listening to this Folky-jazz vibe album even guesting the Eagles.
1, GREAT CD.........BRINGING URBAN VIBE TO STRAIGHT UP JAZZ: I loved the cd.......Teodross is still less known than his peers....though this album soars among the best.....he reminds me of antonio hart
1, This is a must if u luv Jazz
1, The most inspiring book I have ever read.: I read this book in the 6th grade and it was very heavy
0, Fire and Ice: The Korean War: This book read like a reference book. There was a dry history of the Korean campaign
0, Right Back was good: Their new material on Right Back proved that without nowell they still had some songwriting talent. This album contains some decent reggae songs but they are glossed over and it sounds like pop and the lyrics simply are lacking. They seem really disorganized and they don't really have central songwriters. This album really lacks good instrumentals
0, Excellent: Like it. Love it. Live in Paris will always be in my top 5. She is a star with this incredible band. Some of her originals are too melancholy for me
0, Doesn't hold up: The first time I used this feeder
1, 3.5 stars: A very laid back album
0," Could this be Tom Petty: I have know idea where all of the positive reviews come from for this album . I have always been a Petty fan . This is the worst thing I have ever heard by him . How this can even be mentioned in the same breath with Full Moon Fever is beyond me . I have one word for you ""lame "" . I had to give it a one because they do not have zero as a rating . I was fooled by all of the glowing reviews here ."
0, A major letdown: After not having bought a CD in a couple of months
1, quite jingle jangle troubadour: good new album from tom petty without heartbreakers.a taste of honey but lyrics not too optimistic about life on the road and music business. the melodies are sublime
1," The missing ""Traveling Wilburys"" album: Not to say that is necessarily bad. However"
0, The Diagnosis: I too wish you could rate a book as 0.The plot was slow
1, Great stuff!: My husband --- who is a National Park employee --- had these in his first aid and medical supply kit. He bragged that nothing worked as well for his indigestion and reflux. He has taken a wide variety of products for his upsets --- including some prescriptions. I was skeptical
0, OH! I GET THE PUN NOW: The title is a pun as a paint brush is used to paint pictures of the victims with their blood. The cheerleaders are never in cheerleader outfits
0, Louder
0, Dense and confusing: This book covers a lot of material. The quality varies from chapter to chapter. Figures are sprinkled here and there with very little explanation of what they mean. Additionally
0, Pick a different book: This was the assigned text for a short section on electrophysiology in my first year graduate neuroscience course. I did not have a math or electronics background
0, this cd sucked: this is one of the worst cd's i have ever listened to. If you enjoy music that encourages you to murder your parents
1, Loved It !: I am pretty new to house music but found myself totally loving this CD. Nice strong beats. Great music. It's the type of cd that you can play over and over and never get tired of it. Almost addictive.
1, Readable
0, Bah!: No
1, 1955 classic: Reissue of original
1," If I can I give it 7 stars!!!: ANThology is the best CD that I've heard in a great while. This CD is not well represented by ""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Movies"". Even though I think those songs are great they are not the greatest songs on this CD. This is a band that has talent not only vocally but instrumentally"

1, Brian McKnight.....: This CD was not one of Brian McKnight's best CD's
0, Very stupid: My sister has this CD. We had to listen to it in the car and I hated it. It's not even R&B! Every song on it is a slow song. It's like GET OVER IT!!!!!

0, Was for a friend: I ordered this for a friend at work

1, Gotta Have It!: Sometimes in life you have to call it when people are telling their story.This button makes it easy to call.Numerous expressions that all relate the same messege.This is an adult item but you're never too young to call it when you hear it.Quite a funny device
1, Wouldn't really call it a toy...: I bought this for our military office. It is quite hilarious. We press it everytime someone needs a BS call. It does a few different sayings and everyone has begun to use it. It's a lot of fun.
1, Gran HOMENAJE a Los Tres: Para la gente que no esta bien informada
1, My mind was runnin away: This album is in a league with Jimi Hendrix
1, Failed in 3 Months
1, Great School Bag: I have had this bag for a week now and I love it. It has many compartments for pens/pencils
1, Works fine!: I bought two Linksys WPC300N Wireless-N Notebook adapter to use on two notebooks (Toshiba and HP) and the installation process ran fine without problems. I left my Win XP takes control my wireless conections and configurations and I didnt use the Linksys's application.I have a new Linksys wireless router WRT160N and with these new configuration I could notice an improve on my network.I am very happy with these equips so far.
1, Incredible!: I absolutely loved it. Not for kids and could create some missconception or confusion for people who have not practiced Zen. It is quite raw
1, THE definitive Zen Movie!: As far as I am concerned this is THE definitive Zen movie! It is true to the Noir genre
0, Don't know if it is really leather.....: I had this sofa almost 2 years now and I really think I wasted my money. This sofa looks great at first but the quality of leather(?) is terrible. It started with small rip and its getting bigger and bigger each day. I have 3 rips already. I don't know what to do with them.
1," Worth the wait: This book is the best account of Shaolin and its practices available. It appears to be the only book written with inside knowledge of the real Shaolin order. Wong Kiew Kit's ""Art of Shaolin Kung Fu"" is one of the better ""outside looking in"" books dealing with Shaolin"
0, A boring story that doesn't stand the test of time: I'm a big fan of cozy mysteries and I picked this novel up because I thought that it would be similar to Agatha Christie's work. I'm in my mid-40's now
1, A Good Disc even better if all new: Public Enemy are my favorite Rap Group&I've championed what they have Done with there work for years.however not everything has been on Point as there Hey Day 87-91.this set blazes with the New Material&Up- frontness but the Remixes&Live stuff is cool as Bootlegs but nothing to get on a Regular Released Album to me overall.Put it Up&Son of a Bush are my Jams here.I dig that Edge to P.E. best of all.I'm feeling the Lyrics&Depth Here.I'd say this Album is between a 3&Half to a 4 overall.Lyrical Content alone is tight to me.
0, Altogether disappointing after reading the wonderful Pride and Prejudice: I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but
1, Classic: Classic story of life and love. A bit difficult to read in the old English but having seen the movie made it more understandable.
0, Dull: I found the book sentimental and boring. The characters were unbelievable; one neurotic and one naive. This book would be good for those who are vulnerable and easily swayed by the words of a woman who's obviously never had true romance.
1, Good: The only thing I didn't like was that Marianne ended up getting married with the one she married. But I loved it
0, The least liked of Jane Austin works.: I read this book years ago and forgot that I had read it. It was not enjoyable then and certainly not a enjoyable read the second time. I regret the purchase.
0," Proves ""Feminist Thought"" is a contradiction in terms: The book that started off all the hate-driven"
0, Noise: The worst CD of any genre I've ever heard. What is it? Why is it? People pay money for this? Even druged-up you'd complain to turn it off!
1, A worthy tribute to the master: Robert Johnson's life may have been cut short at an early age
0, too loose: the joint is too loose
0, Large Cross is not Large: This items says LARGE CROSS
0, a bit dull: Thank heavens for one single elegant
0, The band sux: I love the watch although the self winding feature causes some accuracy problems. A few minutes a week fast. The real disppointment is the band. Most of its gold tone has rubbbed off with normal wear. Whats up with that? And to make matters worse a replacement band has been impossible to find even at Seiko certified jewelers. I guess the lesson here is stay away from cheap gold tone bands.
0, Does the dog get saved?: John Travolta is an angel sent to Earth to give William Hurt a heart
0, This movie STINKS!!!!: I was on the edge of my seat watching this movie...then I fell over asleep! Let me tell you something
0, Not MOBILE FIDELITY: This company is misleading music consumers by calling their product Original Recordings Remastered instead of ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING - the trademark of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. Buyer BEWARE! Get the real thing on ULTRADISC UHR by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.
1, finally a kids' CD i can enjoy too!: i cannot say enough wonderful things about john lithgow's kids' CDs. thank you thank you thank you for finally making kids' music that wont drive the parents insane. smart
1, Inadequate Book Description: Book was in nice condition
1, Still a great read: I read this about 8 yrs ago
1, Mindblowing!: I bought this second hand on impulse. When I really listened to it carried me away into a world of sound and brought me back changed. Words defy me! Amazing playing!
1, I tell my back-bothered friends about it.: When I was sentenced
0, Uncompetitive versions: Despite the fact that Jane Eaglen can produce some beautiful sounds
1," mature audiences only: i love it!r.l stine did a great job on this but isnt for childeren uder at least 13 because how the gresome detail about ""oh kristy!""felicia cried.one of the support beams had cut off kristys arm.felicia could see the white bone and the ragged layers of muscle.""bricks had cruched anys face his nose and lips and eyelids scraped raw"" so i warn u this is not for young childeren if you are in to gruesomw stuff like me you should reaf this but i just wanna warn you the details are pretty gruesome if you love r.l. stine read this during the day cause at night when kristy and andy are found you may see visions of them beware!"
1," Son loves it.: My son absolutely loves this book. He thinks it looks like him and his Daddy. There aren't too many books about a son and his Dad.I don't really like how the writer repeats words on every page. IE ""next we dunk"
1, Try the ones from B&H: If you want these at a better price
1, A Wonderful Appreciation of Time: Without a doubt
1, What can I say
1, Great book: This book is about a young girl in Berlin during the holocaust
1, LOVING THIS: There isn't a Sunday that goes by that I don't listen to this fantastic recording. When it arrived
0, beware: Sorry for the silly title... no great emergency here
0, Too confusing: Not as good as 'The Winter Queen' or even 'Murder on the Leviathan' (which I did not like all that much).Had a hard time keeping track of all the characters and military movements.I'm very disappointed
1, The Best: Geri Halliwell is so great and this interview is just on of the best things she has done so far in her solo singing career. Shes the Best!!!!!!!!!!!
0, Everything was good except....: Yes
1, Want nice skin
1, Love it!: Wonderful for sensitive skin. Not only do I use it instead of soap in the shower; I also use it on my 3 year old
1, Loved this book: Fantastic book with incredible writing. I could not put it down once I started reading it. The story was so engulfing it kept me wanting more and more with each page I read. This book was such a joy to read
0, Leaks: I should have listened to other reviews. This filter housing leaked since day one (usually a drip here and there
1, Look Great Naked: I found this book to be very helpful in toning those trouble areas. I've already noticed a difference
1, Winner at Aspen: This coming of age comedy is unusual
1, A lot of talent: This is a very nice Cd with a huge amount of talent. Nice selection of tunes and very well edited. Well worth the purchase!
0, Cheap piece of crap: Ok so I opted for this one since it had the vibration. Bad choice the plastic broke on the 1st use. Should have bought the cheaper non vibrating metal one. Hindesite is 20/20.
1, Lucid Portrait of Mental Illness: When I was sophomore in college
1, good book: Book is in pretty good condition and I was please to get it in the mail
1, Absolutely Amazing!: I read this book under the impression that it would be a stereotypical mental illness book. Once i read the first chapter i knew that it was different from any other book that i've read. The emotions that she goes through. The way she describes her feelings. I was enraptured throughout the entire story. I couldn't believe that someone could go through something like she did. It was unbelievable. And the ways she pondered her suicide
1, Take it from me-- it's realistic: Even though I (fortunately) neither suffer from depression as severe as Esther's nor have to deal with the oppressiveness of the 1950s
0, Surprisingly slow and a tad boring: I love books about psychiatric hospitals or mental illness. Sadly
1, Girl Spirals Downward to Suicide Attempts!: Esther Greenwood is an accomplished
1, Page turner: Like another reviewer stated
1, Are you living in a bell jar?: This is an easy book to read
0, Boring and stupid: Don't buy the cd! The guy that gave it 5 stars doesn't know what he's talking about. I also believe that the guy gave it 5 stars TWICE. If you do want a good offspring cd
0, Very Poor Picture and Sound -- DVD Version Would Suffice: Perhaps this is the best that can be done transferring an old video production to Blu-ray
0, impossible to (...) any more than this: If you are thinking of punishing your neighbors you should buy this album and play this at full volume. Actually
1, Wolverines Rock: The wolverines are a country group here in Australia and have done great songs about the life and times of our people and there main song I love is 65 Roses. this gruop raised millions for c.f suffers in our land
1, An excellent read!: I have interests in cooking and history. This book covers both and in an excellent way. The author's writing style is engaging and entertaining. I felt drawn into the book immediately and have a hard time putting it down. Ms. Coe's insights are funny and the amount of detail presented feels just right. She covers first the foodstuffs unique to the Americas then dives into the specifics for the Aztecs
0, How to make this serial even better...: Mmmkay
1," hypnotic insights into mingus' mind: Aside from the opening ""Myself When I Am Real"" - the title of which could easily have been the title of this album - the solo piano performances on this disc are sometimes halting"
1, A Beauty.Worth the Price.: This is my favorite everyday wear bracelet
0, Did not work: I ordered this battery months ago and still can not get it to work. I did email the seller but did not get a response. This is the second battery I purchased for my Sony camcorder that did not work.
1, Typical Amazon quality!: Product arrived super-fast
1, Full of Surprises: The whole CD is very good
0, dissapointin: i dunno maybe teddy riley has run out of steam but when u listen to guys first album the songs are instantly catchy here nothing is really hey at least better than blackstreets last terrible album
1, buy it but don't expect too much!: Had this been guy's first album i would've said that it's an excellent debut set. However
0, Not the Wizard of Oz MOVIE soundtrack lyrics: I didn't realize that when I bought this karaoke cd of the Wizard of Oz Broadway Musical it meant that the songs would be interspersed with dialogue from the show and extra song lyrics. What a major disappointment for us fans of the movie! It turned out to be a complete waste of money for us. :(
0, least reliable clock ever: the alarms just do not work on any regular basis
1, Timeless story now brought to life by Focus on the Family: We already have the full collection of Chronicles of Narnia books
1, Fabulous Product: This product is the absolute BEST on the market. There is no stain or odor that escapes its power. I recommend this to all parents of young children and all pet owners. You will be glad that you have it available. Absolutely fabulous !!
1, For incontinent/aged/sick people too!: Anyone with an elderly parent who has one of those portable toilets in the bedroom. Just take the bucket part
1," Overlooked Gem: Why this one is always overlooked I just don't understand. Originally conceived as a ""covers"" album (see liner notes) Trane takes Chim Chim Cheree and Nature Boy even further out than he had done with My Favorite Things while the Brazilia and Song of Praise are excellent examples of Coltrane's compositions at the time.While its great that labels want to include bonus tracks sometimes the set would be better without them. Here its mixed. Feeling Good is an ok track from the same time period while the two bonus Nature Boy versions are very interesting.Plays (along with perhaps Sun Ship) is a great palce to start a post Love Supreme collection."
0," For those who loved ""She"" -- a disappointment.: If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading ""She"""
0, Doesn't work for 2007 Mustang: Double-checked both on Ford's website as well as here on Amazon prior to ordering (both claim it is compatible)
1, Look ma no hands!: This is a great thing to have if you are always on the phone. I use it in the car
0, HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY. REPEAT DO NOT BUY: this was the worst waste of money even. with in 5mins of my first use the rate knob broke. and all the wires keep cutting out. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY as i did. ihad to buy a replacement the same day i bought this. A horrible piece of equipment. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.
0, i would not use this string: The string is fine for the first day. But it really loses its bounce. I would say im a 4-5 player
0, Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever watched: When I finished watching this movie I was completely lost. Plots that go nowhere
1, OK I GUESS: it came w/ very easy to read directions but they didn't say anything for molding the bottom half. trust me you want to know what u r doing 1st.
1, A user friendly text describing life changes.: There is only one author: Anne V. Gormly. The first name listed is a misspelling of the author's name.
0, Do not buy this!: It needs to be said that I am a long time die-heart Metallica fan.I've always put off buying this set because of the price. I wasn't convinced that what you pay is offset by what you get. I finally broke down and got it. Simply put my instincts were right on. This CD/DVD is not worth it. The sound quality is terrible and you already have the songs on some other Metallica CD. You can't justify spending over fifty bucks on something that Metallica dragged out of their circular file. Besides you will get sick and tired of James Hetfield's constant cursing. There is just no reason for it.I advise you not to buy this CD/DVD. Save your money.
1, This is Essential Metallica!!!!: Live Shit
1, This Rules!!!! Best Thing I've Ever Owned!: This box set is amazing
0, garmin: What can I say. Save your money. There are better ways to get this map. I would say just average at least for me. This map is the same as the none topo version of the city navigator except it is supposed to have topo info on it which it does but just average at that. Garmin has been eating to much big dog cat food. It has gotten too fat off it's customers.
1, hunt&hike: I purchased this to product so that I could find my way on a 600 acre piece of property for hunting. I found it to be very helpful and was even able to mark good areas I found while scouting and find them again in the predawn darkness. The auto-tracking feature was really cool and I now have a map of all the major trails on the property. I'm not a tech guy
0, what did i just watch?: Movie was bad
0," Kept waiting for the plot to happen..: This movie is like an ""Apocalypse Now"" in the desert"
0, Mediocre low budget effort from Myrick: I had high hopes for this movie. The premise seemed promising. However
0, Um.....: It's like eating candy made out of artificial sweeteners. No matter how much you eat you can never be satisfied. It's just empty calories.
0, Are you kidding me????: I dont know where these good reviews are coming from....this movie was absolutely senseless. I watched it based on the reviews and was exetremely disappointed.Edit: Had to edit some of my comments because they werent very nice or objective. They were right after I watched the movie. I will say though: This movie was pointless and without any clear plot. If you have never heard of this movie when it came out (like me) there is a reason. If you look on other sites for reviews you will find out how poor this film was actually rated.
0, Yawn...: This movie was incredibly slow. I fell asleep twice. If you are going to go based on the good reviews
0," Don't make ""The Objective"" your objective tonight.: Had potential"
1, A Really Great Movie!!: I love this movie
1, Perfect: My dog loves this food. And I love the veggies added
1, It's about the history of the farm.: Had no idea what happened to one of the greatest race farms in America. This told it all. Quite a shock
1, El Año del Diluvio: Pretty okay book. Don't feel like writing much more than that as I have to go write an essay on it.
1, Michael's HIStory: As Michael Jackson is and will always be my favorite entertainer of all time
0, My dogs won't eat it: We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble. Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it. They aren't normally fussy eaters. I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him
1, Alizée - Amazing.: Gourmandises is Alizée first album. Well worth picking up. Those who don't speak French will not any any trouble finding translations for the songs on line. As a non-French speaker
0, Vitabath Original Spring Green Shower Gelee: I had a sample of this many years ago and I thought it smelled wonderful
1, The best guide for Product Managers: If you want to follow some steps in your decision making processes as product manager

1, Entertaining: Our small group at church read this as something a little lighter that the ususal. I had never read her books before and I totally enjoyed it. It was an easy
1, Laughter and Love
0, Little substance
1, WELL DEPICTED SCENERY AND TRUE TO THE RANCHO WAY OF LIVING!: I WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT WAS FILMED. THE FILM WAS WELL WRITTEN AND DIRECTED. IT WAS TRUE TO WHAT WOMEN IN LATIN AMERICA SUFFER FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. THE WAY THE WOMEN WORKED TO SURVIVE WAS WELL DEPICTED. A MUST SEE MOVIE
1, Great entertaining read: This book compares modern farming practices with traditional Amish and sustainable farming methods. Due to the authors use of personal observation and interviews of both types of farmers
0, Poor track selection
1, Great !: This is the best general history of humanity I have ever read. Diamonds main thesis is that Eurasians dominate the world do to their geographic location not racial superiority. He gives lots of good details on the development of agriculture
1, Interesting stuff but don't watch the documentary.: For what it's worth
1, intellectually honest treatise: Diamond deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for this extremely insightful treatise that dispels the prejudicial notion of racial superiority. Guns
1, Enlightening history of civilization: One of the best books I've read. A compelling
0, Not a good Kindle Edition: I already know this book is interesting and I'm looking forward to read it
1," Best presentation of cultural evolution: This will be a defining work. It is a superb answer to the ""why"" of history. I enjoyed the book very much and continue to recommend it to friends and other readers."
0, Fiction or junk science?: The author attempts in leaps and bounds to make causal inferences such as
0, The worst thing to come out of the Bell curve/IQ debate: I'll make this short. Pure dreck. As an academic myself
0, This is a miss: This book could be about 25% the length that it is
1, Flawed
0, He blew it on Page 20!: While I urged myself on to finish the book
1, Thought provoking from 90 miles up: The book itself is presented as a broad overview of history
0, What in the world ?!: This book is the worst book I have ever read. It is slow and basically repeats the same message throughout each chapter. Whats the point? It's also to long and could be a great book for people who a lot of time to waste but i think it is written poorley and it a bore. If you need a bad book to put you to sleep this is it!
0, Apologist: You will read that all cultures are equivalent
0, Boring: This book takes one chapter worth of material on a very interesting subject and repeats it over and over to the point where the reader is bored sensless. I couldn't even finish the thing. I learned from this that the Pulitzer prize is no mark of excellence. Don't waste your time.
1, One of the most important books I have read: Ever wonder why the people in Africa are black? Or why most Chinese people look the way they do? Why European and Asian societies were ahead of the native societies with which they clashed? This book provides a scientific analysis of how these things developed. Essential reading for anyone who has ever wondered about the differences -- and similarities -- of people around the world.
1, An Excellent Book
1, Good with Caveats: The fact that a book that claims to explain the origins of human society doesn't contain a *single* controversial statement from the perspective of the politically correct left should perhaps come as a warning sign that this book is less of a revolutionary exploration than a reflection of current academic biases.That being said
0," disappointed in this ""so-called"" scholarly work: I wanted to place GUNS"
1, Ambitious and Fascinating: I am impressed by Diamond's willingness to dive into areas outside his specialialization. To me that is the great strength of this book
1, Sheds a new perspective on human civilization...: I picked this up sometime ago
1, Guns
1, One of the best thinkers of the modern day: Jared Diamond asks then answers the age old question
0, Unrated
1, Eat your vegetables...: Is Jared Diamond tendentious? Of course. Is he as bad as Stephen Jay Gould? No. There's a whiff of Lysenkoism (a term I just learned and like...it means using science to justify some ideological aim) to the book
0, Repetative: VERY easy reading. As one reviewer already mentionned
0, Disppointing: We listened to the audio CD version of this book and it was a disappointment. The reader's voice was grating and often distracted from the story. But the story was overlong as well
0, A blatant lie to make liberals feel good.: It is a very well written but still cheap propaganda for a politically correct view of the world. A very complicated and truncated system of lies and deceptions to make non-white races feel good about themselves. To explain away their strikingly minimal contribution to the modern world.Sorry folks
0, Great book suffers from bad Kindle version: This is a wonderfully logical argument for how things came to be the way they are
1, The best historical romance published in a very long time!: I'll keep it simple. If you like historical romances
0, New Christy Minstrels make Elevator music on LSD!: Perhaps the strangest album ever recorded next to Lou Reed's machine metal music (2 vinyl discs of amplifier feedback).The singers harmonize as well as the 5th Dimension
1, id say you need more than 2 cds for pearl jam: id say you need more than 2 cds for pearl jamanyway great collection and a hidden trackrip layne
1, This is a great collection.: Arcade perfect ports of Mercs
1, best: got this game for my husband and we received it today and he loves it he missed these games and he just loves it it arrived super fast and i would get this game if you love these games
0, Worthless piece of crap: I purchased these speakers for my boat
0, It's not coming from the heart: Leann Rimes is one of the best singers of young women country singers but this is just a big mess this album. What you are hearing is spares off of her other albums that never made the final cut. Who really wants to hear those songs from artists. Curb records put this one together Leann Rimes had nothing to do with it. The single and title track I need you is really good and they sell the single out there of that and thats really all worth buying. Her next album will be better all of her fans know that.
1, Probably her best album!: LeAnn Rimes is almost always good
1, A GOOD ALBUM IS ONE THAT YOU WILL LISTEN TO: While this album is one Rimes herself put no artistic imput into
1, An informative two-column quick reference guide.: This informative little 55 page paperback book gives summary comparisons of business practices in China versus the United States. The authors' presentation is made in a two column style throughout the book. The left-hand column is for United States normal business practices
1, Sound Advice for the Journey: While the advice on making money is not revolutionary
0, Revisionist Version--BE WARNED: We bought this thinking it would be the same thing as what we had once had on VHS. This version is not the one with David Bowie (as mentioned by other reviewers)
1, Visually stunning!: This has been a family tradition for ages! The story is so sweet and the artwork so beautiful - but the music is ethereal. It stays with you throughout the holidays. This is no 'Frosty the Snowman' type movie - this Snowman is unforgettable!
1, The Raymond Briggs 'The Snowman': My children and grandchildren have loved this for years and now my youngest (aged 3 and 4) also count it among their favourite stories. It prompted me to buy the DVD for them
1, Great Christmas Video: This is a very gentle
1, It's a classic!: A beautiful
1," Surprise Kit: I do a little soldering with my dollhouse miniatures and am just starting to use the LED lights which need resistors. I honestly missed the ""kit"" part of the description"
1, David Sanborn's best
1," Welcome to the 80s (Part II): I first took notice of the opening track ""Chicago Song"" during Roman Polanski's film ""Frantic"" (Harrison Ford). Sanborn's music really made that scene memorable. Ford's character is on the trail of his kidnapped wife and visits a chic Paris disco called the ""Blue Parrot"". Everyone is decked out in 80s designer clothes. Ford meets this Jamaican cocaine dealer"
1," Hence the subtitle: And Other Curious Encounters: Loren Coleman's book is very interesting and well written. Although the title includes the word ""Mothman"""
1, My new favorite game!!!: This game is seriously one of the best games ever made! I brought this home from GameStop and my boyfriend went out the next day to buy it for the Wii. You can have two save slots on the DS version
1, ..But check first with your eye doctor: I never thought I would give five stars to a game that involves probably 100+ hours of matching jewels on a grid
1, puzzle game with a story...: The puzzle part of this game is great - but the story well it is a little INVOLVED for me
1, Beautiful Shelf: This shelf is EXACTLY what I wanted. It's beautiful! The hardware to install it is a bit lacking..only two screws and that's it...this could be a problem if your studs are not exactly right
1, Mine is fine...: As another reviewer said earlier
0, BORING!: This book was quite disappointing. They're 100 pages basically just introducing the perfect stereo type family and in two pages with a brief description the church is bombed. Then in two more days it's back to normal. The author used the same metaphors over and over again and it got very tiresome and annoying. The book was very predictable. A long story for a short plot. I don't reccomend you reading it for it's a waste of time and it certainly does not help you better understand history seeing they only spent two pages on it in the 200 page book.
1, an okay book: I think this book is an okay book. It is definitely not on the top of my favorite book list
1, A 4th grade teacher reading it out loud (and reading it for the first time): Though we're only half way through it
1, Brea's review: I think that you can loose yourself in this book very easily. Many nights I found myself loosing track of time while ready it. The best thing about this book is that you can relate to it so easily. there is always one character that you can relate to. I love how the auther describes the characters. he makes it easy for anyone to imagin what is happening in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get lost in a good novel.
1, Miss Ronning's 5th grade: I rated this book 5 stars.Byron is a troublemaker. His parents send him to Grandma Sand's house in Birmingham. Something happens there that changes their life forever.I gave this book 5 stars because it was neat to know how an African American family lived.I would recommend this book to someone because it is verry funny.If you like funny books I recommend you read this book.Janna
1, Laughing a Mile a Minute: The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 was an awesome book. It was a laugh out loud
1," Good book with hilarious scenes: The Watsons Go To Birmingham - 1963 was a good book with some hilarious scenes. I think that Byron was the funniest in the whole book. The things that he did would almost make you laugh out loud. The first incident he had was that he was kissing himself in the mirror of their car called the brown bomber. It was cold so his lips got stuck to it. He also bullies his little brother named ""Kenny"" and some of the ways he does it is funny. He told Kenny that they picked up frozen people in the garbage trucks. He said that because Joetta kept griping because she wears so many clothes and she does not want to. He also tells Kenny there is something called a wool pooh that kills people by drowning them. The Wool Pooh is not real and it is really just a whirl pool. If you're looking for a funny book"
1, Good book: This book is about a family living in Flint
0, Too Tight: We had extreme difficuty trying to place the case on the phone. A portion of the cover ripped. Maybe mine was defective. I would suggest stretching the cover before placing.
0, Uninteresting: I can't find one really catchy song here and the voices sound rather weak. They try to be a bit like TLC
1, I'm feelin' it: Can't get enough is my favorite
1, A tribute which rivals the masters: The Comedian Harmonists were a German a capella group who specialised in mimicking instruments with their voices
1, Easy to Use
1, Sony DCR-DVD308: Excellent video camera
1, music forever: i have already this cd bat i wantet it in sacd I like especial the five pert iheard that tune in many pictures
1, GREAT FUN!!: Back in the 1970s
1, Excellent slowcore - this is very relaxing stuff and it has some great appeal!: Bedhead may not be for everyone as they are distinctly a slowcore band
1, Great...but not SUPER GREAT: I loved the album....great tunes
0, Jamiroquai permanently lost in commercial limbo: Ever since bass player Stuart Zender left the band
0, Ulimate Editions 3 & 4 Not Extended: Obviously
0, Azcaban- Real let down: If you loved the book and wanted to see it followed and not butchered do not go see this movie. Key scenes from different chapters were just combined in confusing incomplete context with deep lack of plot. Vital information that let's you follow the story is missing. Too much time was spent on scenes that were inconsequential
0, Worst movie ever! The book beats the heck out of it!: This movie's pace was too fast
0, Will entertain...the first time you watch it.: I watched this when it opened
0, Very Disappointing: There were several things very wrong and left out of the movie that I felt were crucial to the overall plot Just a few things are:-They never explained that Moony
0, why pick Alfonso Cuaron?: I love the Harry Potter books and the movie 1 and 2 but this is the worst one so far. I had high hopes for this move but it was a big let down. I know they had enough money to do more and put in alot more than they did. The only reason why i gave it a 2 star is because of the one person
1, No Jason! -Cries- Oh Well.: Well
0, Connect The Dots..If you read the books...: I have read 1-5 of the books and found Sorcerers Stone & Chamber of Secrets films had captured the magic of HP. However
0, Well acted but plot lacking: while i thought the movie was good
0, Not what it could have been: If you read the book
0, Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie was so bad when my dad wanted to see is again
0, SUCKED!!!: this has to be THE worst harry potter movie so far. i mean the guy didn't even get the whole book. there was a lot more to the book than the movie. i mean the special effects was great
1, great movie!!!!!: i think this is the best harry potter movie ever.my favorite scenes are always the beggining with the dursleys.i laugh every time i see it.even though they cut it down a bit from its original description in the book it is still my favorite scene. my favorite characters are petunia dursley(fiona shaw)and proffesor minerva mconnagol because they are both funny. great movie other than that too!!!(...)
0, NOT the extended version of the movie: I pre-ordered both the ultimate editions of Harry Potter movies 3 and 4 believing they would be the extended versions like movies 1 and 2. They are NOT the extended versions. Why they give the extended version for 1 and 2
0, The Directer is Not Up to Speed: This movie was a let down. The new directer was terrible. It did not follow the book and it completely changed the way characters and places looked. The new Dumbledore was good except his beard and hair was not long enough or white enough
1, The BEST Film Ever!!!!: This truly is the best movie I have ever seen! Alfonso Cuaron was the perfect director for this movie. Daniel Radcliffe
0, Dissapointed: Lucky for me I didn't buy this
0, Upset: My parents bought this for me for my birthday i had no idea they didn't have the extended version. I feel very ripped of! Since they made it look exactly like the others if you don't carefully read it could end up buying it for the extended version just to learn there not there not wanting any more of these for the future! at the very l;east they should have lowered the price since it contained less then the first two.
1, Movie is excellent - wish I'd received what I ordered: As you'll guess by my review title my feedback is not directed towards the movie - probably my favorite Harry Potter movie - but instead is intended as a warning to those ordering this version. Look closely at the packaging before you open the cellophane - if you're like me you may receive a 'full-screen' (aka cropped on both sides) version of the movie rather than the wide-screen version pictured on the product page and described in the product detail. I'm not sure about Amazon's policy with returned open DVDs but I returned mine unopened for what I'm told will be a full refund.FYI my ordered was sold by 'Opti Shopper' (fulfilled by Amazon) and in addition to being full-screen it appeared to be marketed for sale in France - everything on the cover was in both English and French.Didn't want to bring down the overall rating for this movie by giving this non-starter 1 star
1, Too much tinkernig with the headmaster....: Enjoyed the movie...any time you get to the 3rd movie it has to start to get tough. Glad to see that they got Malfoy's look together
0, No extended cut just expanded price: If you enjoyed the Ultimate Edtions for one and two do not buy this edtion it isn't worth the added cost. There are five hours of documentry
0, Ultimate Edition?: I an not rating the movie itself
0, Hopelessly disappointed: Yes
0," Dont waste your time: Unlike the first two ""Ultimate Editions"" they didn't bother to include the deleted scenes back into the movie. You are only paying extra for some cards and special features which doesn't make it worth it. I only bought these because I assumed they would continue on like the first two movies and include the full movie with the deleted scenes. I will not bother wasting anymore money on these."
0, Very disappointed.: I am a huge Harry Potter fan. watched all three movies in the theatre at least twice
0, What in the world were they thinking?: I am in a state of shock! Any sane person who actually read the book could oviously see the stupid changes made and the EXTREMELY important things left out. For instance
0, Waste of money: There are not additional scenes in this. Why did I pay more? Just for a bunch of recyclable paper. Major disappoinment.
0, Fairly Disappointed: Ok
1, Review: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie that I have ever seen!Although
0, Responsible persons should be shipped to Azkaban IMMEDIATELY: I'd be here for hours if I were to try to explain how I felt about this movie. I felt betrayed and utterly disappointed. This should have been the biggest and best film yet. Having read the book over the summer with my children
0, Cuaron was the worst thing that happened to this movie: Okay the director is what really suffered in this movie and the box office reciepts showed it. It moved too fast with little connection or explaination; characters personalities aren't built well;The worse thing you can do is read the book first and then watch the film; too late you say
1, Who Says it Doesn't Follow the Book?: Who Says it Doesn't Follow the Book? I don't understand these people who think this movie doesn't follow the book. They must be all or nothing kinda people. First
1, Loved it: It's Harry Potter need I say more. I really love how the producers kept as close to the original book. I can't wait for the rest of the movies.
1, Happy with my purchase: Abou a month ago
0, It was Ok
1, Instant Clasic: Second only to The Number of The Beast
1," Still Shreds: Maiden's ""Powerslave"" is still among the best of epic metal that one can find"
1, Maiden's Best Album. PERIOD!!!: Not only is this my favorite Maiden album
1, jaw drops
1, Does the Job Well: I'm not crazy about the scent
1, Thunder From Down Under Still Rules: I'm glad to see that some thinks don't change
1, It's AC/DC........Do you need to know any more?: Definitely one of the better efforts for quite some time from the band
0, What a disappointment!: I'm seeing a lot of positive review here
1, Strong
0, DISAPPOINTING ...: I'm a huge AC/DC fan. It's my favourite album. I have hundreds of rock albuns in my collection. I admire the fact that AC/DC never cared about other people's opinions
1, Not There Best but Still Great!!: AC/DC after 25 years of dishing out amazing Rock and Roll songs prove that they still can Rock and Roll. Stiff Upper lip realesed in 2000 is not AC/DCs best album but it is still very good. The better songs on the album are stiff upper lip
0, Top 100 Golf Teachers: I purchased this set as a present and I was told their were to many of the same teachings from one DVD to another!
1, Great !: This is Maiden's first album featuring drummer McBrain
1, Classic Maiden!: A great offering from Iron Maiden
1," From the ground up: the story of ""brother Van"": From The Ground Up: The Story of ""Brother Van"""
1, This is very entertaining: Alright
1, really touching songs....yuou'll love them: their songs are beautiful and these girls really have talent....i can relate to every single one of their songs....i used to be crazy bout pop princesses like britney and christina....but i think m2m are so much more!
1, Great!: Um
0, Dated and linear: Dated and linear but with a good McGuffin. I had to finish it but after it went straight in the bin. I couldn't think of anyone else who might want to read it
0, Don't waste your money: I bought these dolls to go with the KidKraft Georgia Peach Dollhouse and was very disappointed in everything about them. They look cheap
1, Cute: The dolls are cute but a little cheap looking. They will do the job for now until I can find something a little nicer. Great for the price!
0, review: This product may look fun but it is basically a couple pieces of plastic with scraps of fabric glued on. i would never recomend this product and i doubt that these were really hand painted.
0, Didn't like this one --support and fit not good: Since I have had some success with Bali lingeries
0, No all it's hyped up to be...: Not sure why it's called double support bra
1, I love it: Great fit! Need to order more. There's nothing more to say about this. I think I have 3 more words here :)
1, best available: I've purchased Bali attire for many years. I'm always happy with it.This product came quickly
0, Lestat
0, disappointment again: I have always been a huge Ann Rice fan
0, Blood Canticle: I have read all of ann rice's books and have debated of them all at some point in time. though this book is one of her worst ones yet
0, Blah
0, SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO LESTAT!: Lestat advises us to skip chapter one if we are unhappy in our reading. Should have listened
0, disappointed: i really wanted to read this book as it tied together and ended both the lestat series and the taltos series
0, What a waste: Ms. Rice has lost her ability to write
0, What the... Where is my Brat Prince? I give it NO STAR!: Well what can I say
0, Annoying: This is the first book of this author I was exposed to. I did not like the story
0, Quantity over Quality: This book is the worst effort by Anne Rice. It feels like she phoned it in. I always hoped that she would merge the Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Saga. This is a sore disappointment. Lestat's quest for sainthood and his sudden passion for Rowan Mayfair are so far fetched it is almost funny. I will sincerely think twice before picking up another of Ms. Rice's books. Perhaps her genius departed with the unfortunate passing of Stan Rice. Maybe her stories could be more foreceful if she concentrated on one book per year like most other writers instead of cranking out two per year as has been the case lately. If you are contemplating reading this book
0," How awful: I'm trying hard to finish this book. But it is so hard to think that Lestat would say any of the ""cool"" words that Anne writes. ""Give ME a break"" Anne"
0, Worst Vampire Chronicle ever: What a depressing end to an amazing series. Of course it hasn't been good since after Memnoch the Devil
0, Why isn't ZERO stars an option?: These reviews are more entertaining than this terribly written book! As a young reader I have read more intellectual content in the pages of Harry Potter! Yes Anne
0," Not the best: It wasn't ""horrible"" but it was certainly not her best. The style doesn't seem at all similar to her usual stuff. I found it very disjointed and had a hard time following the story line. I think the reviews would be worse had it not been a chronicle book.I would probably read it"
0," Awful...: Why waste my time with an extensive review? Anne Rice can't even be bothered to even attempt a half-way decent novel. I mean ""Yo"""
0," About as awful a work of fiction as you can find.: I absolutely loved the Mayfair witches novels - until ""Taltos."" Then the series took off in a direction that can only be classified as ""tripe."" Poor Anne Rice - I think she has finally run out of inspiration for her novels of the supernatural. Having suffered through ""Blackwood Farm"
0, Since when???: I have not read this book yet (I live in a rural town that isn't selling it- about 8 copies of Blackwood are in the bargan box at the book store
1, formidable: je suis bien contente d'en avoir prix 2 (un pour le plancher et un pour le toit). Ainsi je peux laisser courir mes chinchillas sans craindre qu'il ronge quoi que ce soit ou il mange de l'herbe (dehors)ni qu'il s'échappe en dehors du parc.
1, Great source for yarn descriptions: I was looking for a primer on yarns. The first part of this book catagorizes yarns and describes the characteristics very well. I highly recommend the book if you are interested in yarn characteristics. The section of patterns was fun to glance through
0, Switching noise using HDMI: Excellent sound quality
1, Sharp and powerful...!: I decided to go for this receiver instead of the TX-SR674 which is exactly the same as this except for the added benefit of up-conversion to HDMI for $200 more.I am not disappointed. This receiver is very user friendly. It supports speakers of 6 Ohm impedance which many receivers do not openly support. If you are buying a new speaker system
1, just right without breaking the bank: if you are thinking about getting an intro surround system
0, BETTER THAN A SLEEPING PILL: The mostly negativ reviews say it all
0, Glossy Rubbish: If you are interested in the Black Dahlia murder case and went into this film thinking it was going to be a dramatic
0, can i give less than 0!!!!!: Ugh!!! Amazon not giving me a 0 option! Rented this movie last night - was looking so forward to it. Enjoy Elroy's stuff
0," Hollywood Garbage!: I have read several books on the case. I knew it would be a ""hollywood"" film"
0, Plan Nine from Outer Space now has stiff competition: What can I say? Amazon doesn't allow a zero star or minus-star rating. This howler deserves all the ridicule heaped upon it.A cesspool of bad acting (with the exception of the Dahlia
0, Poor effort by DePalma: It is hard to believe that Brian DePalma directed this film. The best thing that you can say about the film is that the period sets
0, Even the Transfer Looks Dim: The many critics of this film
0," Slumming Streets Of Hollywood: Take Raymond Chandler's noir ""slumming streets"" of 1940s Los Angeles"
0, Disappointing: My friend has a minor talking role in this
0, Another Disappointment From De Palma: Despite his impressive visual style
0," How to turn a great novel into a pathetic movie in 1 lesson: The Black Dahlia was an excellent book. It made my ""Ten Best"" list in 1987.L.A. Confidential"
0," Murder of the twelfth degree: ""The Black Dahlia"" is a mess. Everything's impressive and nothing is right. It seems like Aaron Eckhart's character should be played with more darkness"
0, Not the best showcase for the talent this group may have: How does this CD contrast with the better ones from Tool
1," a must buy: This CD is not ""cutting edge"""
1, David has rose the bar! His voice is awsome!!: This has to be the best rock album I have ever heard
1, great group!!!!: diturbed kicks major butt. these guys are great listening music. if you don't like disturbed then there's something wrong with you. this cd would be a great investment.
1, BADASS: Lets keep it simple
1, THE BEST! CATCH THE SICKNESS: I HAVE SEEN THEM IN CONCERT....I HAVE THEIR CD... I HAVE SEEN THE WEBSITE AND AM CONVINCED THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS AWESOME. NOTHING BUT LOVE TO THEM. SCREW WHOEVER DOESN'T LIKE THEM...BUY THEIR CD!
0, sick: this is the sickest cd ever!its so sick!ya bro
0, Not so great cd... why do people like it?!?!?: i mean yeah... the first time i heard stupify i thought it was pretty good
0, Not that great
0, More of the same: In my humble opinion
0, Over-rated: Young
0, pop metal [junk]: if u like listening to about 2 dowtuned power chords for 40 minutes
1, One of the top 3 albums of the year!: This is one of the best records of the year
1, Better then most of the CDs i listened to: This cd was alot better then I thought it would be. Stupify and Down with the sickness are brillent works of art. Better then all the other crappy pop-punk and drive-heavy bands.
0, Skip it: Sorry
0, The one and only: Looking for a good rock band is hard so when i heard of disturbed i was hopeful
0, down with the suckness: I dunno. Their singer tries to be real scary & intimidating. But it just makes me laugh. It doesnt help matters that he is 5ft tall with boots on. I guess alot of people buy into it when he does his growls & grunts & tries to look evil & tough. If the music was really good then maybe I could overlook the singer & his cornball lyrics. But the music is alot of cheesy riffing & recycled garbage thats been done alot better by other bands. Recommended for angry 12 year old boys only.
1, One of the Best New Bands of 2000: Disturbed's first CD release just rocks. I heard about the group from a friend and I decided to buy the CD when I saw it at the local OnCue. I was amazed when I listened through the entire CD. The only song I didn't like was Conflict
0, rather bland: i had such high hopes for this album
1, Sounds good loud: Excellent album that really makes you want to bang your head. If you like hard rock
0, Not great stuff....: 'The Sickness' has a few catchy sing-a-long songs that can be found all over the radio that
0, DIVING DOWN ...: I've got a warning for you
0, Alot better than the other Dizzavid albums
1, VAN HALEN RULZ!!!!: The only reason this album gets four stars and not five
1," So What if It's Not Fair Warning or VH I!: This album has taken quite a beating from both critics and fans. The lambasting is undeserved. It is true to say that this is not ""Fair Warning"" or their debut"
1, Dive Down With Rock N' Roll: I honestly don't see how anyone could be disappointed with DIVER DOWN. Released in March
0," Where have all the good times gone?: This is only for die hard fans! With hindsight you might wonder if the band already had decided to break up. The songs are far from the high standard we got used to from albums like ""Van Halen I"" and Van Halen II"""
1, top notch album: People seem to either love this album or hate it. Cover songs
1, Underrated: When this album was issued it was hated by critics and many fans as well. I guess time has proven them wrong. There's a couple of tracks that are just Roth's silly adventures and should be skipped: happy trails and big bad will. The rest of the album rocks as hard as any other Van Halen album. At the time it was issued
1, Amazing: To date
1," Rhyne still at his peak-: Mel Rhyne is without any competition my favourite B3 player.. he has it all.... deep blues feeling....groove.....interesting refined licks... and he is not stuck in the ""blues trap""Still... he seems to be almost forgotten....WHY?????When Mel Rhyne plays it is Mel Rhyne we hear"
0, don't buy this: It worked great for 6 or 7 uses then the brushes stopped turning & while the bearings on each end turned freely the belt wouldn't turn them. So I emailed the company & they told me to go to a Sears repair center to get a new belt & was told to call the company which I did & they told me to go to a Sears repair center. After slamming down the phone I went out & bought a dirt devil hand vac which I should have done in the first place. Not that expensive but still a waste of time & money.
0, Way too big...: These earrings are way bigger than you would think they are. I don't see how they expect ANYONE to wear these!
0, missing fast forward control!: i like to record tv shows and FF thru commercials. Unbelievably
1, Plays Multi-Region and PAL & NTSC DVD's: Here is a great DVD player if you are looking for one that allows you watch DVD's from ALL regions (just follow the hack codes listed in the first review which takes less than five minutes)! It also converts PAL to NTSC or NTSC to PAL via an internal converter (something many other players do not have) so you do not need a PAL TV (in the USA) or NTSC (Europe). The picture quality is good. It's NOT a high end DVD player with outstanding sound and crisp pictures.I'm now playing Region 2 DVD that I purchased by accident a while back!The remote control is not the best
1, Great DVD Player: I got information about DVP5140 Philips from my cousin. I like this stuff: inexpensive
0, Don't waste your money: I received this one as a gift. When you try to open the tray
0, Not long-lived: I've had this dvd player about 16 months now. I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of use when it worked
0," I agree with Mark Twain: I read opinions before buy this product. At beginning it worked nice. Then a ""no disc"" message is all it does. I will not buy Philips electronics again."
1, great dvd player: this model and the one listed for multi region are the same you just have to change the region.
0, I hate this thing: I bought this because I wanted a player that would play DVDs from whatever region I purchased them (I wanted to buy DVDs in French). Regardless
1, Happy: This product is very good and I am happy with my purchase. The delivery was like WOW. It was really fast.
1, Very touching: This personal account of the holocaust by Elie Wiesel's book is a horrifying story of the Nazi death camps. The author tells the story in a simple manner
1, Strength beyond......: This book is a testimony to the strength of all humankind. People all-too-often don't know the strength they have to endure everyday life let alone something as terrible as the Holocost.
1, Man's Search for Meaning: Just a note to the reviewer below
1," The Holocaust For Real: I have watchd many movies that ""hollywoodize"" the holocaust and use theatrics to depict what happened. ""Night"" is the most gripping tale of that horrific event I have read or seen. Kudos to Elie Wiesel for being able to control his emotions to write such a compelling"
0, Night: This story has been told so many times and this did not add anything new that hasn't been told many times before. I know this was his life
1, essential to understanding the 20th Century: What marks this book from so many on the annihilation of the Jews in death camps is its brevity. The book is so spare that it is hard to understand the horror without reading it so slowly that you are practically reading it aloud. There are really vivid characters in it
1, Night: I have been reading the books from the Oprah book club for a few years now and usually enjoy them. This one was exceptional!Maybe because it is a true story. It is horrifying
0," How can a just God allow unjust things to happen?: (OOOOOOOOPS!!! My review has been posted and to my embarrassment I realize that I have made a MISTAKE. I wanted to give the book five stars instead of one. At this stage of editing I am unable to change the incorrect rating. But since I can add to the main body of the text I wanted to at least set the record straight. Sorry for the mistake.)Elie Wiesel is a genius. He makes you feel the horror of hatred. And yet he doesn't leave you in total despair as the book ends.All of us wonder how a just God can allow unjust things to happen on earth. Wiesel doesn't offer simple ""bumper sticker"" answers. But he does get us thnking.Another book I read this year"
1, A book that needs to be read and discussed.: I've read Night before many years ago. This reading was as searing and heart breaking as before. Not only does Elie Wiesel bring his community's days in the ghetto
1, Night by Elie Wiese l: I think everyone should read this book. I read alot but few books touched me as this one did. I think that the period of time just a few years prior to my birth in 1946 had events so unbelieveably perpetrated by human beings that they must be revisited often to revalidate that the events were indeed fact and not fiction. The book reaffirms the strength of the human spirit.
1, Night: I was very moved by this book
1, There are no words...: A very difficult read
1, eye opening: This book should be on every adults list of books to read. This book has put my life in perspective.
0, Disappointing: I found this novel disappointing
0, How I hate TTTE: I ate Thomas the Tank ngine
1, Shiloh: I thought Shiloh was a good book. If you like dogs and rescue stories you'll like this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
1, Mart Preston tries to save Shiloh from Judd Travers.: Shiloh is a dog. He is the main character in the story. His owner
1, You Wouldn't Want To Put It Down!!!: Shiloh
1, The book was exciting in every way.: This book is about a dog named Shiloh and a boy named Marty. The story takes place in West Virginia
1," Shiloh...A Super Story: The book I reviewed is Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. I gave this book five stars because it is very happy. This book is about a boy ""Marty"" that finds a dog and names him Shiloh. One problem in the story is that Judd Travers is a person who treats animals badly and still wants his dog Shiloh back. But Marty also wants Shiloh and will take any risks to get him. I recommend this book to a friend because it is happy. Other books that Naylor writes are The Boys Return and The Bodies In The Bessledorf Hotel.Emerson"
1, An amazing book: I loved the book you made. I think Shiloh is an awesome book. Keep writing and I'll keep reading. I love the drama and how marty tries to save shiloh. I cried alittle when Shiloh got hurt by the huge German Sheperd.I think its an emotional terrific book. Shilohs the number 1 book made.
1, Kate's review of Shiloh: I like this book because of what it's about. This book reminded me of Lady and the Tramp because Lady and Shiloh ran away and found somebody they liked to be with. This story is about a dboy named Marty
1, A heartwarming story for all ages.: This is the perfect book for any animal lover. The main character's devotion to a stray is something that is very important to share in a time when adoption areas and shelters are desperate to find happy homes for unwanted
0, very promising 
0," Don't believe the hype!: I love Spike Lee movies --- ""Do the right thing"
1, Great Hammock...Great Price !: I wasn't sure if this hammock would actually hold up to all the great reviews b/c the price is so low compared to all the others. I am glad I bought it. The quality is excellent. It is very soft against the skin. It is big enough to hold myself
0, Inexpensive and cheaply made: I would not recommend this item. The weave is very loose and does not offer much support. I plan to send mine back for a refund.
0, Never received the product.: I can't even rate this. I never received it after waiting for almost a month. There was no tracking information. I had purchased this for a gift and since it never arrived was extremely disappointed.
0, I agree--this edition is terrible!: I'm in agreement with other reviewers on the terrible quality of this edition! After reading just a few pages
0, This is one bad cookbook!: I just hate wasting my time trying to make a recipe from a cook book like this. For one thing
0, what a waste: I chose that rating cause I truly feel that they could've done a better job showing hendrix's visionas an artist of that era. They never delved into his personal feelings about his own music and they also never mentioned how he felt trapped between his Contracts with ppx industries all of his legal problems with his record companies. And the music that wasn't hendrix was terrible.
0, HORRID!: I recently watched this movie
1," Admirable !: I love the 9th more than any other Beethoven symphony! Why...listen to the 2nd movement ""Molto vivace-Presto-Molto vivace-Presto"". The 3rd movement is fantastic as well ! Then"
0, Kindle version is worthless: Because I already own The Red Pocket Book of Spanish Verbs in hardcopy I didn't bother to sample it first. That was a mistake I'll never make again. The hardcopy book is a wonderful and useful reference
0, Bull Shit: I do not watch television on a schedule
1, These guys are really funny ;-): So far
0, Poor Quality Siemens: We bought the Siemens 2402 with two receivers and then a another 2.4 GHz Siemens two-line with two receivers. Both systems exhibit the same really bad quality. Conversations are cut off
0, Scratched disks: Several disks were scratched to the point of missing several chapters. I understand this was a used set but still expect to be able to listen to it all.
0," This sucks: I have read this series and was bitterly disappionted. It is so disjointed (he wrote it over two decades).anyone who writes themself in as a god like character has real ego problems.He put off writing these series of books for so long because he had no idea of where the story was going.Basically he had a killer opening he thought of when he was 19.""The man in black fled across the desert"
1, Awesome!!!: Having read every word Stephen King ever published
1, Who hired the illustrator?: The book itself is amazing just like King's previous installments to this series. One thing
1," Hooked again: ""Buick 8"" left a lot to be desired"
1, Important to the Series - but Long..: I won't dissect the installment since many others have done excellent jobs of that here
1, A Detour: Volume Five of the Dark Tower series is good
0, Steve needs an editor more than ever: Unlike the original which is tense
1, Amazing reading: I love Stephen King books
1, Be prepared to stay up all night to finish the book!: I have been reading SK books since the early 80's. I have read almost every book he has written.This one is one of the best written in the Dark Tower series. Fast paced and suspenseful.
1, Best Songs i ever heard: Man i tell ya when i went to germany and i heard these songs........Let's jut say Nobody offers better Dance/Techno music out there......These people are just cray......The beats and the songs just make your body crave for more........
1, One of the great movie scores ever released.: Quite literally one of the greatest movie scores ever composed.Great job Danna & Egoyan.Sevag
1, the book is really one that every woman should have.//////: I have read many of Miriam stoppards books
0, Repetitive
1, A remarkable
0, STAY AWAY FROM Maxtor Diamond Max Plus 40 GB: Stay away from this hard drive. Lasted less than 10 months. Western Digital apparently is better. I have read many negative reviews about this after I purchased it.
1, Maxtor 40 GB... Easy to install... Easy to use: When I bought my computer three years ago
0, review of company GEMWORKS!!!!!!: i still haven't recieved the product.i found out although i ordered it on 2/12----they DID NOT mail it until 2/26!!!!!!!!i am very VERY UNHAPPY with GEMWORKS COMPANY!!!!!!!i resolve never to do business w/ them again!!!!too bad they are connected w/ AMAZON.com because i have been pleased w/ amazon so far. i hope you let gemworks know about this as i was unable to get thru to them despite 4 e-mails!!!!!!!!!!thankyou-jan
0, Horrible Product: I got this in the mail a couple days ago. It wouldn't let any water out at first so I figured I had to play with it a bit to get it to work. So some water comes out and I put it in Midnight
1, Fascinating!: This book is great! The whole time you want to know more
1, One of my all-time top ten: When I was a senior in high school in the fall of 1980
0, MSN direct shut down...DO NOT BUY!: MSN Diect
1, The Perfect Album: This is simply a wonderful CD. Every track is amazing. Patti's voice is mixed beautifully with an ideal blend of instrumentation. Truly an original offering. Deeply mesmerizing lyrics and melodies. You won't be disappointed with this one!
1, New to philosophy: I read this book last semester in my Philosophy 100 class. I thought it was probably the most influential to me because I seem to share a lot of views with Fromm and he can be easier to read than I thought Nietzche was. Very interesting
1, Useful and fun to build: A nice unit for the hobbyist electronic
1," Try the I.R.S import ""The Best of R.E.M."": I noticed all the complaints on sound. So my 5-star rating is really for an import"
0, Why good music disappear...: Today's HNIA is like a different band
1, The Creation of the World: A mixture of George Gershwin and Brazilian classical music directed by one of the great symphony maestros of the 20th century. Sounds classical but more in line with Aaron Copland's ability to take folk music and give it a big sound rather than the atonal qualities of most modern composers.
1," One of the Best Collections of English Madrigals: Any fan of the King's Singers will regret not having this album in their collection.This album offers a veritable feast of the choicest English madrigals found on any comparable album. From the obligatory ""Now is the Month of Maying"" and ""Fair Phyllis"" to the more obscure ""Tan ta ra"
0, what is this: not total body purge for sure.bought 2 from one shiper and 2 from another possitively not product shown 4 bottels say so.doent look grape-e-power to me in the picture.
0, A farrago of quotations
1, Great for young readers!: The Star Sisterz series has been the redemption of my daughter's reading habits. She refused to read for a long time until I gave her the first book Nova Rocks. She devoured the entire series in just under two weeks. This is nothing short of a miracle for the girl that hates to read. I've read the books too and found them to be filled with fun humor
0, Nice size
0, wont last more than a week: I was SO HAPPY when these recorders arrived because they are simply gorgeous!!! However- unless you plan on putting them on display in a glass case- dont bother buying this. the paint chipped off immediately after after the kids began using them. The next day
1, master links: This is a broad collection of Link Wray at his best. Most of it is instrumentals
0, Mini-skirts are not appropriate for this era: I love to watch the Barbie movies with my 4 year old grand-daughter
1, One of my Grand-Darlings' favorites: It's nice to see Barbie still thriving and in this case
0, unavailable: I ordered the item and was sent back a message a few days later that the item was unavailable. I was refunded and I ordered a different product.
1, cute!: Purchased for my daughter who loves Barbie DVD's. Would recommend for all little girls who love a good story with happy endings! A great birthday gift for sure!
1, weird sizing: Small sizing. Also
1, Sunny Days: I remember as a youg musician exploring different avenues of musical expression
0, Total Ripoff!!: I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months
0, Hey--The Emporer has No Clothes: The best thing that can be said about this album is that it will probably be his last. I am a huge Beatles fan
1, A must for the Harrison completist: This special edition of the final George Harrison album is a must for the artist's fans. The DVD--while a bit on the short side--shows exclusive interviews with the reclusive ex-Beatle
1, SWEEEET!!!: Not a day goes by that I do not listen to this album. Don't think I will ever tire of this music. It is uplifting
1, Saved his Best for Last: This album is a must for all Harrison fans
1, A Final Gift from Beatle George: Its too bad that George took so much time off from making music in the last years of his life. This is such a good group of songs
1, Part Nick Drake
0, Bogus: There is nothing going on here. This guy is hero to the art school crowd. But listening to his precious conceits is boring. Having just seen him perform in David Byrne's review of contemporary hippie-wannabes
1, Monkees #2??: What can I say?I grew up watching this show
0, Doesn't Make the Grade; Not a Bang - Just a Whimper: When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999
1, The book: An excellent discussion on theoretical and practical uses of serum protein electrophoresis.
0, View it as a series of B-sides and it's worth a quick listen: Yes
0, Esto no es salsa...........................: La musica de Victor Manuelle es floja y no se puede clasificar como Salsa. En realidad es un sonsonete recyclado en cada disco. Como Boricua e instructor de baile de salsa puedo decir que las personas se frustran tratando de bailar salsa con la musica de Victor Manuelle. Les digo que si quieren escuchar y bailar buena Salsa escogan la musica de la Sonora Poncena
0, Couldn't finish: Characters are flat
0, Boring as it gets: This book was just plain boring. I really liked Grisham's older work
0, The King of Torts: The story just seemed to go no where. Just about a lawyer who took an underhanded deal to make a lot of money and just kept on doing the same thing when other opportunties came along while missing his girl friend the whole time inspirt of the honey on his arm. Of course he lost all the money
1, No Real Insight into the Legal World but a Fun Read!: I enjoyed reading this book although I was hoping for something more. As an aspiring lawyer
0, Big Disappointment: Unless you want to learn about mass tort law
0, Bad: I really liked the way this novel started out
1, Not the best Grisham
1," Different from the average Grisham novel.....in a good way!: King of Torts is a little different then the ""average"" Grisham novel. In a good way. While I love novels like The Firm"
1, king of torts: This is an excellent book. It was very realistic and believable. I highly recommend it.
0, Terrible
0, Grisham Off-Peak: This book has the appearance of being churned out quickly
0, Where's the climax?: I started reading this book and liked it very much. Then it ended. With all the build up and the foreshadowing I thought that the climax of the book would be great
0, disappointed: I think Grisham has lost his edge. If this was supposed to be a thriller
0, Worst Grisham to date: This has to be the worst story line Grisham has put into the public domain yet. I have read all his previous books and keenly anticipated another legal thriller but I could not actually bring myself to finish it.What multinational firm in their right mind would go out of their way to find
0, Grisham Falls Flat on His Face: I am a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books except the 2 that he wrote recently which were not lawyer based. After his first 4 books Grisham was by far my favorite author but he seems to be no longer giving a good effort.King of Torts starts out OK with some promise but the last two thirds of the book is very mediocre
1, What do you mean? This is Ralph at his Best!: Just to clear things up
1, Favorite Disney Movie: This movie is one of the all time great Disney classics ever made
0, Not a true BD: The transfer is not that good. The aspect ratio is SD with bars on the sides. Total ripoff.
1, Child's movie: this was a purchase for my toddler
1, Excellent: I purchased this DVD for my 16 year old daughter who loves Disney's classics. She enjoys viewing it by herself or with others. Its great to still have some of the old classics presented through modern technology.
0, SCARY! SCARY! SCARY!: I have to admit that I was REALLY scared of this wovie. I actually had to leave the room ( since that was my first time watching it.) The witch ( whoever she was?) Was REALLY frightening. I was SOOOOOscared that I had to sleep with the covers over my head.
0, what is this????: This Disney movie was rather terrible! I thought Snow White's voice was quite annoying. It has some things outdated. It doesn't compare to my favourites: Cinderella
0, Can not get it to play.: I loved Snow White and was so excited to get this movie in Blue Ray and see how great it looks and it won't play. We have done the updates and still nothing. I am very sad.
0, Not Happy: The delivery was VERY fast. We got the DVD about a week before they expected. However
1, Absolutely Stunning!: Video - 5 out of 5Audio - 5 out of 5I can't put into words how amazing the blu-ray version of this film looks!!!
1, One of disney's best films !: Get a hobby whoever said that they were the only one who hated snow white and you you head over heels you best go head over heels for this movie ! This is disney's 3rd best !Bottom line ?This is one heck of a movie !
0, Eh-So SO: The DVD worked well
0, bluray packaged as dvd: i was really disapointed with this product. i bought it because it was a 2 disk dvd with bonus bluray disc. but that was not so. it is a 2 disc bluray with 1 dvd packaged in the dvd packageing
1, one of the best classic movies of all time: Every parents should have this movie in their collections for their kids. A classic story of prince charming coming to the rescue to save the lovely snow white.
1," A Disturbing Little Book: You've heard stories referred to as a ""Psychological Thriller."" This is ""Philosophical Horror."" It's well written"
0, Zebra to Elephant...: Give me a break! The title is offensive. Who would want to read a book with such a title? Certainly not this introvert. Maybe one of those stripe changing zebras? I'm an introvert
1, where is the gate?: some see this as the beginning of the end of swedish death metal. some see it as the beginning AND the end. its all here: the crunch
1, The best series I have ever read!: Margaret Weiss' best work was done in this series. Never before have I ever felt any kind of emotion or related to the characters in a novel as I did with the Star of the Gaurdians series. The emotional ups and downs and the care given to bring out the personalities of the characters actually make you feel as though you are there. This series blows Star Wars away.
1, great: This film
1, One of the Master's best: This could be Hitchcock's greatest film
1, The best: Along with Rear Window
1, Great romance and espionage story: An American spy
1, tyson in the ring: I've just recently purchased 'Tyson' DVD (the James toback movie)but of all the Tyson videos/Bio's out there
0, Disappointing: So
1, A good primer for the topic at hand: I was really hoping for a more detailed time line of the events leading upto the ENIGMA and what eventually lead to the first commercial computers during the late 50s and mid 60s. The author spent a great deal of time detailing the mathematical advances and controversies that spurred the technological advances we see today. Overall the book was mildly interesting
0, still yawning...: Ledisi is less than average...there
1, Soulsinger: My brother was in Oakland
0, Nice concept
0, Keep the headset
0, Not compatible with Toshiba E740: I bought the card because it said that it is compatible with PDA.I first had some troubles with transfer large files. Then had trouble with backup(back-up) of the Toshiba E740 pocket PC.After chatting with Toshiba online support
0, GREAT - IF YOU NEED A BIG PLASTIC PAPERWEIGHT: What a peice of junk! Almost immeidtaely
1, live: this collection of live material is great.the only complaint is that sometimes it sounds like the vocals are not loud enough.this shows why randy rhoads was so great. a must buy
0, Choking Hazard: I dont know how the little freak did it
0, Disappointing <sigh>: These polemical
0, Worst phone I have ever used!: The voice quality on this phone is just horrible. Little did I know
0, Its not that good.: This phone has a couple of serious shortcomings that make it less than ideal for home use. The worst is that if any station answers
0, Heater Cover: The cover was very hard to put on and take off
0, Very shallow view of Italian business culture: This book provides a glimpse of the Italian business culture that is hardly worth the price. I was better served by Passport Italy
1, Simply the best.: This recording will put any other rendition of Strauss or Hindemith to shame. Brain plays with a lightness
0, Repeats from other collections: I'm so disappointed: I'd thought this was a Maeve Binchy collection I hadn't read yet
0, Victoris Line
0," This is ""Remastered""? You Gotta Be Kidding! A Terrible DVD...I Returned it to Amazon!: I was looking forward to watching A Farewell to Arms starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. The words ""Remastered Edition"" caught my eye and I ordered it -- without reading any reviews.Alas"
1, a delight and totally enjoyable: I smiled and laughed out loud so much with this one that my roomate couldn't wait for me to finish so she could get her hands on it. It's one of the better young adult books and totally believable. I had more fun with this book probably than anything else I've read. Couldn't wait to read the 2nd one!
0, TERRIBLE!: I wouldn't make my worst enemy sit through this entire movie! I would say this is definately one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did I buy it? Reccomended by someone. I don't talk to them anymore!
1, You just cant get enough
0, OK Metal: Alright attempt to follow up of the Classic original. It was entertaining and the music was alright
0, A Waste of Time: The appeal of the original was that it was an animated version of the magazine. The appeal of the origial magazine was the mixture of styles
1, The best violinist in the world!: This CD is one of the first classical music CDs I ever bought and still one of my favorites. It was the first CD of Nadja Salerno-Sonnenburg I ever bought after seeing her profiled on 60 minutes many years ago.I have several CDs of Itzhak Perman
0, not what I thought it would be: I put this on my registry
0, Why is this still on the market?: I use it for lightweight items because everything else kept falling out and/ or caused the velcro straps to come undone. This thing needs LOTS of improvement and I don't understand why they haven't been made after all of the complaints. I found it at Target for $4 and it helps to keep baby's nursery organized but it is temporary. There is NO WAY I would pay full price for this thing.
1," ""It's hard to tell the singer from the song"": I discovered this c.d. at random in a used music shop.........I'm glad I did. It's a keeper! This is a great album to 'be with' when you're blue. Hazel expresses so much in her huge voice with careless statements like;""...starin' at that worn linolieum tryin' to trace the lost patterns 'round his tears...."" ""...we sometimes drive away the ones who care"
0, AVOID WASTE OF MONEY: I bought this CD thinking it would relax me after a long hard day at work
1, Moonwatcher's Memoir: A Diary of 2001
0, the second rock n roll swindle: this cd
0, Not Bad
1, By far the best!: As a violinist myself I can only say that this is the best recording by far
1," Creative MuVo Tx FM 512: I have had the TxFm 512 for almost 2 weeks now. It's a breeze to add/delete songs to the unit using ""drag and drop"". Both W2K and WXP recognized the unit w/o any problem.I have problem plugging the unit directly into my machines' USB ports due to the ports location and orientation"
1, This should be required reading for the depressed.: Darcy Dancer live's among the Irish aristocracy. This seems to be something of an oxymoron
1," Key in My Ignition: R.Kelly is a musical genius! Rather its a remix of a remix or famous colloquialisms that we've all heard before (esp. us from Chicago)like ""up off in college"" or a nice grooving/grinding beat"
1, Great book
1, Very True!!!: Okay
0," Are you joking?: A friend of mine gave me a CD entitled ""Gabriels Groove"" and told me I had to listen to it because it was the most awful creation known to man. I didn't beleive him"
0, how is this considered music?: I wonder if they know what rythem or a beat is? I have been playing music for 8 years now and I can't even imagine how they wrote this piece of garbage. Garbage is actually praising this CD because it seriously is worse than my dog's vomit. Buy a metronome so you can keep a f**king beat. This isn't anything new or experimental. It's just atrocious.Also
0, Ok
0," Shark bagless: What a piece of junk! My maid brings her old upright because she won't carry this heavy machine upstairs and it really doesn't clean at all. After a new years party we had some spanish nut halves on our hardwood floor and the vac wouldn't pick any of them up on the hardwood setting with the brush/beater turned off. It would barely move them. If it can't pick a half of a peanut up why even bother wassting all of those watts. After my first test run on the carpet there was nothing in the cannister. Guess my maid's must have cleaned up every spec of dust before I tried it. Another review stated ""wish we had negative numbers."""
1, great movie for a laugh: my husband wanted this after seeing it on television.it is definitely funny and not for young kids.
0, How to become a co-dependant racist heroine: Okay.I LOVE fantasy. Good ones. This isn't badly written and the world is intriguing but Meredith
0, Sounded to good to be true: I tried this device on 3 computers. xp
1, Good for family devotions: This has been a useful addition to our family devotion time. Gives us some thought provoking questions to prompt us to think about what we've read in scripture.
1, It's Homemade: Reminds me very much of the first American Music Club album: excellent songwriting
1, For family of fans: Notwithstanding a few glaring factual errors
1, Great magnet!: The die-cut was very lifelike. It's heavy and well-made
1, Would make a great movie: I read this many years ago a a teenager
1, great photos: My husband and I went on a 4-month camping trip throughout the southern states and took hundreds of photos with our 6.1 Digital Concepts camera -- amazing photos
0, Surprisingly Amateurish: I love R.E.M. and I particularly love the R.E.M. songs that were recorded under the I.R.S. label. However
1, An Good Supernautral Ghost Story.: A Family of Four (Karen Black
0, Ha Ha Ha (but no ones laughing): After reading Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in English class I came to appreciate the book. Upon reading the first thirty pages or so I thought that the book was easy readying and should not be read in an 11th grade English class. As I read more of the book I say the true meaning
1," ""Angela's Ashes"" without the redundancy: I read ""Paddy Clarke"" soon after reading ""Angela's Ashes."" While I know that I'm comparing a novel to a memoir"
1, exxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxccccellent!!: I just loved this book....it gave me a good time and it is just hilarious.....
1, A Real Irish Childhood Vision: A superb exploration of a childhood character in the Irish setting. Brought through an imaginative focus upon the growing pains of such a wild creative mind. Easy to relate to with such memories of a forgotten childhood.
1, Perfectly plotless: In his fourth novel
1, My Favorite: This is definately my favorite musical Christmas CD. I was so happy to find it at Amazon
1, Garfield The Movie: I was very inpressed by the service I recieved from this company.I recieved my DVD in 3 days and in perfect condition as promised.I will definetly order from them again in the future.
1, Great Family Entertainment.: Well done
0, Why Did My Little Brother Drag Me Into This Crap!: I Hate this movie it really sucks dont get it on DVD or even freakin watch it
0, As bad as the duck...: Sometimes it is not a good idea to turn a lovable cartoon character into a full length feature film. This was one of those times. From the beginning of the film the story plodded along
0, Oh
0, when jennifer love hewitt is a star of a movie...: you know you are in trouble. i can't believe they took a small piece of my childhood happiness and made it into this piece of cat litter. i hope children who see this do not imagine this is the garfield that has been a staple of comic strips for 20 or so years. (...)
0, unadulterated junk: My son has been watching this and I find it unspeakably insipid. Silly stories
1, Garfield: My grandson loved the movie and begged me to buy him the DVD for his Birthday
1, a natural journal with fox in the forest: This movie shown the pure and natural heart of the little girl which can attract the fox to get closer to her.
1, Farewell
1, Another Great PT/Brion Collaboration: This is another great collaboration between director Paul Thomas Anderson and musician Jon Brion. First
1, So Damn Good!: Anyone who says Punch-Drunk Love (the movie or the soundtrack) isn't absolutely wonderful should be ...well
1, Perfect for DX6I
0, Great music
0, Worst movie in years: I haven't seen such a negative
0, C'MON DOC WHERE TALKING CLINICAL DEATH
1, Excellent Indie Album: I can't believe I am the first person to submit a review of this album. This is an excellent CD. The Masters of the Hemisphere are (were as of Nov 2002
0, Bad design - drives me crazy: Push buttons on the rim are exposed and active even when the cover is closed. They cannot be disabled. These buttons control ring profiles so that the phone will change to silent without warning.
0, Please Help Me!: Hey people i have a question for anyone that knows of any information on the Motorola v600 camer phone from cingular. Could anyone email me telling me why the v600 was discontinued and when it will be avaiable for purchase at cingular stores.Please email me back i really want to know. Email adress: mdsteele189@kc.rr.com
0, Worthless--Try the State Dept Website: If I could figure out how to get my money back for this item
0, bad dream? badly written !: First
1, 23 Minute in Hell would be enough for anyone!!: I believe with all my heart that what I read is factual. I believe Bill Weise really did experience this. What a horrible thing to go through. But also what a joy and relief it must have been when Jesus Christ lifted him up out of the inferno. After reading this book all I want to do is live more for Jesus Christ and tell other people what they need to do in order to be saved. Truthfully we can't really grasp to what Bill went through and mostly we will not be able to fully understand it. Only believe that it did happen. Is it fact or fiction? You decide.
1, Eye opening: I have read other testimonials about hell and this one is just as terrifying. It's difficult to imagine an eternity of being confined to this place. Truely disturbing and scarey. Definitely makes one think of their fate when we die.
1, Awesome insight!: This is a great book that explains just a touch of what eternal life is apart from Christ! Wonderful read for those who do not realize the absolute eternal life that hell will be.
0, What Would Jesus Say?: In Luke 16 a rich man in hell asked Jesus if he could come back to life and warn his family. Jesus said
1, Enjoyable and easy to read: This is an excellent and well documented account of one man's trip to hell. It was very easy to read
0, Unbelievable...and people are buying it.: I received this book as a gift
1, Surprised
1, a little too simple: I agreed pretty much with all the posts for this story. Cherish was sweet
0, (yawn): Dorthy Garlock's Love and Cherish has an insipid meandering excuse for a plot. She drudges along a well worn path through historical romanance: the lovely but tiny young maid falls in love with the huge life-harden man and in turn wins his heart. I love a good roamance with a happy ending
1, Buy this CD!: I bought this album about 2 months ago and have listened to it everyday. I'm a big Anthem fan
1, Excelent Album !!!: This is a great album from Vicentico
0, Disappointing: Sr. Miño (b. 1949) is an excellent guitarist from Seville
1, like it: Came late to Miles and his Jazz and I don't have a strong music background but I do like this as well as most of his work. For me music that allows me to concentrate while being entertained.
0, Schizophren-X: Perhaps instead of calling this album 'Song X' a more appropriate title would have been 'Schizophren-X'. The notes are so disorganized and scattered that it obviously gives the listener some insight into what an auditory hallucination must be like. There is absolutely nothing groovy about this recording. Quite frankly it is down right frightening
0," X-out Song X: What are you people thinking? Has the world gone mad? This is NOT jazz. I can play better than this and I don't even play saxaphone. Someone came up to me the other day and said ""Hey this is great stuff!"" When I told him that they weren't even playing music whatsoever"
1, Old school at it best!: I really enjoyed listening to this cd
1, favorite Watch.: I can truly say that I am fond of watches
1, Good: The price was reasonable
1, Awesomness: I wanted a long cable to connect my computer to my tv from about 12 feet away and this worked perfectly.
0, This was a big disappointment for a Belkin product.: The signal was so degraded on this VGA cable I was startled. I have had many Belkin products before and have never been this disappointed. The ghosting was terrible and totally washed out. I can't send it back because I cut five feet of the cable out to try and improve the performance...didn't work. I purchased two of them and they were both bad. Do not purchase this for any reason. I purchased a Rosewill from Newegg and was completely satisfied.
0, Serious disappointment: Hoping to fill my tv screen 60 led
0, A Simple Product that Didn't work Right: I bought this cable to connect my netbook to my bedroom tv. The cable itself is thick and appears to be made of quality materials
0, Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 4000: I bought this set for my husband. We've had no problems with the keyboard
1, The best keyboard I've purchased: I have always been a fan of the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard because my hands seem to be less tired after hours of typing. Although this one seemed a little flatter
0, Very Disappointed: i ordered this item in December. I noticed that when I received it that the mouse actually is the 5000 instead of the 4000. No big deal I thought. I've later realized the the keyboard is the Wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000. I can't imagine that these were meant to be sold together.The mouse doesn't seem to work with some online games.I hate that the keyboard has no lights to show when the Cap Lock and Num Lock are on or off.
1, Wild and out review: Wild and out is one of the funniest shows in America and is hollywood at it's best. Sometimes it's really funny
0, Theological concerns about this study: We ordered this latest book in the Sisters Bible study series in anticipation of the same quality of previous excellent studies in this same series. However
0, Not accurate: I tried all the strips in the kit. The results did not correspond to a more elaborate test I did afterwards to confirm the rather questionable results from this kit. If someone is serious about testing his well water
1," Best of its category.: I recommend this thoroughly interesting and informative book for anyone attracted to ""Making friends with the sky"". Beneath a Vedic Sky is easy and enjoyable to read. It contains all the basics you need to know in order to begin"
0, AC Home charger+car charger review: I purchased this product on August 2 2012
0, Try something else for your car: If you were going to use this product for the car charger like I was
0, LOUSY PRODUCT
1, Good: Don't know how it works because I bought it for somebody. Never heard from them so it either works as it should or it doesn't hence the missing feedback.
0, did not work: This product was cheap to buy... probably because it does not work!! neither cord worked
0, Piece of Junk: The first shipment came to me completely destroyed - specifically it had been crushed into about a dozen pieces due to crappy packaging. The company said they would send me a replacement at no additional cost. They did. However
1, good value: Good extra cords to have at a good value. It didn't cost a great deal to have the extra cords on hand for when they loose one.
1, Thats It!: Exactly what I wanted! Product delivered as shown. Pretty light weight
0, Opening scene is a dramatic masterpiece: Erik Swanson's portrayal of a young boy too preoccupied with fishing to recognize the beauty before him is astounding.
1, this bra is my favorite: Really. It's my favorite piece of clothing. I own 4 of these
1, Spiritual Omer counting: I am finding this book very very useful; every day is presented a new and profound insight into how we conduct our lives. I force myself not to look ahead
1, Uplifting
0, The wrong device: I used the splitter to send the signil of the dvd player and satilite box to the big screen tv. Forgot to turn off the dvd player off and the next day I could not use the splitter on side that the dvd player was on.
1, Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders: This is an excellent book. I am using it in a Pastor's Thrive Training group. They have also enjoyed it. It is a challenge to wade through some sections
1," Good tricks book for the beginner: I have been a mediocre fan of the ""Dummies"" series. They do a decent job at teaching the basics on a subject.Where these books tend to shine is teaching a subject in an enjoyable format to the beginner. There are a host of beginner guides out there"
1, First Rate Characters: I LOVED this play. It's characters we're brilliantly created. My favorite was by far Beneatha. This play demands emotional involvement. You can't help feeling depressed for the plight of the family because the characters are so REAL! Of all the plays we've read in my AP English class this is by far the best. It seemed very Shakespearian (another timeless playwrite) in its excellent characterization
0, This book sucks: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is boring
1, A Raisin In The Sun: A Raisin In The Sun
1, A story of reversion and redemption: This story was one of the most fascinating plays I have ever read. In particular
1, Definately an eye opener!: This book is an excellent resource for those who want more information about SV40. It is ridiculous that the government sat on this info and because of it
1, Fun gift: I bought this as a gift for someone else
1, Excellent Mystery: When I received my copy of this book in the mail
1, exquisite album: Contained in this CD are some of the most beautiful versions of the great timeless songs of Rogers and Hart. Coductor John McGlinn's orchestrations are flawless
1, FABULOUS!!!: This is an updated
1," V: Season 1: If you're thinking about buying ""V""... Think no longer hit the ""Add to Cart"" button! ""V"" is a great show staring off with the Pilot (the whole season is worth buying just for it!) and the next 3 episodes are sooooooo awesome. And the season finale is terrific! Can't wait for season 2 beginning Tuesday"
0, Just Goofy: I was very intrigued by the previews for this show and the first half or so of this pilot was just as intriguing. But unfortunately the plot took a turn for the worst as it transitioned from intelligent to goofy. I was surprised at the ending
0, Another good guys vs bad guys show--unrelievedly: Unfortunately
1, WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS INCREDIBLE CD: I love music of all genres: r&b;
1, He Sure Is: I love this album!! Never gets old
1, great debut album: this is in my opinion not only a great debut album but one of the best Craig David has ever recorded. the US version CD contains the same songs of the UK version with 2 added songs
1," I love this guy!: Craig David's ""Born to Do It"" is awesome! His voice is smooth as silk and his beats are kick booty! Two-step is seriously makin' it huge here. I mean N'sync used a little two-step on there album and they were inspired be Craig David! Criag's album is worth every penny. GET IT NOW!!!"
0," NO ORIGINALITY: The album is only worthy for the catchy ""Fill me In"" and the latin-influenced ""7 Days"""
1, A Rare Talent: Craig David's debut album
1, Craig David- Take a listen.: Craig David has bought a new sound to R&B music. He along with others has made music come back to life again. With his mix of garage and two-step
1, Excellent Purchase: I found the cd to be and EXCELLENT purchase. I love all songs on cd
0, He's lucky he's good-looking...: because this album is a piece of garbage. It has one or two memorable parts but for all the waiting
0, GAG REFLEX!!: This album is just horrible. Justin sounds like a girl singing (and hes not even good at that). Plus he broke up with Britney Spears
0, What the hell is this
0, Thanks
0, serious disappointment from a michael jackson wannabe: i was seriously disappointed when i picked this one up. i'm an nsync fan
0," Doesn't ""Justify"" the Hype Surrounding Him: This is definitely a mediocre album. He's the most blatant Michael Jackson wannabe there ever was. He doesn't even TRY to be original. Could ""Rock Your Body"" be any MORE similar to Michael's 1979 song ""Rock With You""? Doesn't ""Senorita"" remind you way too much of Michael's 1983 song ""P.Y.T""? Justin"
1, good album but groundbreaking? COME ON: this album is a like a modern day michael jackson off the wall record but with hip hop elements from no other than timbaland and neptunes. You can still love a CD and acknowledge that it was inspired by old school music. I myself love old school r&b as well as today's r&b and hip hop so naturally it was an enjoyable fusion for me that adhered to my musical tastes. I actually checked out this CD expecting nothing and I ended up liking it a lot and can't wait to hear the new justin album
0, the king of flop: justin will never
0, Who does he think he is? MJ?: Untalented copycat/wannabe of the legendary genius that is MJ!He does not write those rubbish songs and he does not have a voice. Justified is a Neptunes album featuring Timberlake.Now he labelled himself the New King Of Pop. Everybody knows who was
0," GOD HELP US!!: The song ""Cry Me A River"" has to be THE worst song of the past ten years. It's just beyond listenable. Painful to the ears. A total assault to the ears. Does this guy think he's the next Michael Jackson? Justin Timberlake's falsetto vocals on this track are just embarrassing. And it's pretty bad when the backup vocalist on your songs are better than your own. I think the female singer who sings ""talk to me"
1, This is a good CD.: I don't own this CD yet
1, 3 WORDS: OH - MY - GOD!!: this is the second review i am sending in after reading reviews from amazon
1, cutie pie: he is talented
1, Wow!! Brutal!!: I can't believe it. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect Justin to go full-on metal. His guitar playing is absolutely amazing - such speed and dexterity. His bandmates are no slouches
0, Horrible: I still haven't recieved my CD and it has been a month. I guess I'll have to contact the seller again so that I can get a refund
0, i can't stand the guy: but several of the tracks with their musical production were well done though I've heard it all before with MJ. I credit the neptunes and timbaland for their musical genius but it should have been invested in someone who's actually talented. I heard some of the songs were given to mj but he didn't want them
1, Give credit where credit is due: This was a well made cd. I don't like all the songs
0, Making it shut up....: This horrid lad - all over the tv and radio. *cries*. Cant bear it. He is a ex-boyband member (what could be worse
0, Cucumber bar soap: I tried this cucumber soap because I read that cucumber is good for dry skin
0, What was Garmin thinking?: This case came with my c550 StreetPilot and while the GPS unit is quite good
0, WARNING-NOT A CARYYING CASE: The photograph for this product is incorrect. This is just the protective cover that only goes around the unit itself and is included with your purchase of your street pilot. You need to look at:Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case for StreetPilot and GPSMap 176 (010-10231-01) systemsInstead...
0, Worst Purchase!: I had to return this book. It is outdated compared to the other bible dictionaries out there. I wouldn't waste my time purchasing this book. It doesn't contain much information. I wouldn't want this dictionary if it was given to me free. A regular dictionary may be better than this one.
1, Daily ritual: My son watches this on Netflix at least once a day. At age 27 months
0, needs improvement: Having taught Kindergarten for 9 years I can say that this video is cute but not as good as previous Leap Frog videos. The Letter Factory is a much better presentation of the letters with emphasis on letter sounds (needed to learn to read) vs. letter names. If you buy only one leap frog video I would recommend the Letter Factory video.
1, little leep leeped right into there hearts: I hve a daycare and the children are in love with little leep and his movies these are all a hit with them and me thnks
1, the best album: after hearing the song collide on radio I had to buy the cd and all the songs are great. I think he has one of the best vocals
0," wasted pages: The title promised an inside look and stoveside excursion into the heart of Africa. Two entire pages devoted to ""How to Boil Corn"" caused me to throw this dog out with grabage. Regretful purchase....."
1, Looking For an Echo: Interesting story line; music fantastic! If you love late 50's and early 60's music
0, Not what my dad was looking for: Bad acting
1, Terrific selection and terrific artists for Saint-Saens: This is one of our favorite CDs - we bought it for the outstanding recording of Rhapsodie d'Auvergne which is a lovely piece - very well done
0," LOOK CLOSELY!: Look closely at what you're ordering here. Very Very Misleading. The photo show a gallon of ""Shed-Stop"" for Dogs. What you are ordering is actually Shed Solution for Skin & Coat. These are different products.If you are used to using Shed Stop and like it and are looking to re-order it this is not the products.Ingredients are different. See other reviews saying the same. Hopefully Amazon will take it back as I didn't realize the old switcheroo until I went to open it."
1, Big
1, Must have for any library.: Dr. Midell has produced a simple to read
0, what the hell is this: first off i'm mad at amazon.com for not having a slot for 1/2 a star. Because this album is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is by far the worst commercially released album i have ever heard. did anyone even listen to it when they mixed and mastered it????? I'm not going into how great they were in the 70's or how good the songs were in the 80's...cause it would only cheapen the experience..I'm totally mortified by this album .look at bands like the roots
0, sick
0, Nothing new here: Book isn't worth the money
0, Crapfest 07: I am a huge harry potter fan
1, Better than Iridium
1, Bizet's greatest opera?: OK
1, This cds awesome: I like this cd very much
1, Worth every penny: This is the first album i've ever bought for the beastie boys.I decided to check it out eventhough the reviews given to the album wasn't that encouraging.When i bought it
1, da bomb: I loved this cd. espacially intergalactic. I bought this cd and never stop listening to the cd it was tigggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtttttt
0, They Are A Disgrace To All Of Hip Hop: This album is so awful that I sold it the day after I bought it. I think the Beastie Boys should go home to their mole hole... Beastie Boys get P.S. For some real Rap
1, Their best ever in my humble opinion.: I have fond memories associated with this album. It's my favorite Beastie Boys release by far. Quite a masterpiece really. Still holds up after all these years.
0, Not the best thing I ever heard
0, Swing
1, a most excellent album: the beastie boys have done it again.... they've created another good album. a variety of sounds are seen on this album
0, The Beastie Boys can never duplicate Paul's Boutique: In an attempt to return to their original hip-hop
1, fantabulous: They still got it going. These guys will never go old. They got some fresh grooves for everyone to enjoy. I just can't stop listening to it !!!
0, boring: very uneven and uninspired.they try to take on to much.they still are a good group but this disc goes nowhere near there 80's highs.
1," Exellent Follow up to ""Where Shadows Lie"": This is an eclectic release with songs that range from mellow and melancholy"
0, Inflatable Poles: Tons of fun for about 10 minutes until the pole ripped the plactic and deflated. Then it wasn't much fun!
0, Waste of money!: Right out of the newspapers and inaccurate to boot! Just an effort to make a quick buck. Book is so thin that it makes a good coaster though!
1, From a non-*N Sync fan.: People who aren't fans of the pop group *N Sync may be wary
1, You will be sore!: Such a great workout! Guaranteed to make you sweat and feel sore! Great workout DVD and you feel great afterwards.
1, This will get the results!: My biggest trouble area is the whole stomach
1," Great workout: Jillian Michaels is slightly obnoxious in this DVD because of people evidently saying her workouts aren't difficult enough. That may drive you crazy but that being said the DVD is a really great workout. I've done levels one and two and both are difficult. One thing I will say is that Jillian gives you the name of the exercise but doesn't do ""an example"" to show you how to perform it. For beginners who don't know the exercise lingo it may be hard to keep up. Also"
1, Read the Recommendation before you begin!: I got cocky and started with Level 2. Big Mistake. You can't really follow through since she goes by the moves quickly (some of the moves were new to me).I ended up getting irritated half way through the workout and wasted a workout day.So - Read the Recommendation and Do level 1 first!A note about her 'twitter' comment - I understand that she wants to get the message out to people that if the workout was too easy
1, Yoga Zone:music for yoga practice: When searching for music to practice Yoga at home I was lucky enough to find this CD and one other hard to find CD ... I was very happy when I listened to this CD
1, Ah To Be In England In The Spring...: This charming
1, A perfect piece of literature...: From the moment I first picked up this novel
1, I have fallen in love with this book!: Well
1, Every young woman with romance in her heart should read this: This is a book you will read many times through your life. There is joy
0, Not captured enough: I know plenty of people will disagree with me
0, Very Disappointed!: I was very disappointed with this book. First of all
1, The Decorative Art of Leon Bakst: I've been doing art for about 3 years now and recently started drawing dancers. So this book was great as a resource for costume drawing. A bit wild
1, informative: After reading the little book lots of times I got the hang of it. I still have to refer back and forth to the rear cover to read the codes for publishers. I use it all the time.
1, Pocket Guide to Identification of First Editions: This latest edition of the Guide is bigger and better than ever
0, My bad: Because I love the Agatha series and Hamish books by M.C. Beaton
1, Lady Fortescue Steps Out: I enjoyed all the individual characters
0, Average: This compilation is not bad
1, this book is great!!: This is the first book by P. C. Wrede that I ever read
1, I love Dealing With Dragons!: I had heard of this book. I wasn't sure at first which book was first
1, Dealing with Dragons: If you like the fantisy type you'll love this book. The story is really interesting with many twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book incudes a princess who is unhappy with her life and runs away to find something more. Along her way she meets many creatures like a witch
1, Wonderful Story! One of my favorites: A princess runs away to find a better life away from all the proper behavior in her castle. She finds dragons caves and becomes a dragons princess and quite enjoyed it
1," ""I'd rather be eaten by a dragon..."": That's what Cimorene says when she hears she's being married off to this boring empty-headed prince who only cares about swords and tournements. A nearby talking frog hears her and asks her what she is going to do about it"
1, Great Tale !: Cimorene was a bit out of line compared to her other sisters. Although she was pretty enough
1, book on tape Dealing with Dragons: We loved listening to this book. The kids were totally into the characters
0, This is a horrible ripoff!: Metallica doing Thin Lizzy? I guess that once the creative well runs dry
0," This CD is an outright lie!: The record company that put this CD out is telling an outright lie to the customers. The CD ""supposedly"" contains the original recordings of Judy's greatest hits. However"
1, Read at least 4 examples: What you see is abnormal writing. The well-being in special
0, Not worth your money: We thought that since this product was made out of canvas fire hose material
1, Better than most: Out 18 month old dog typically chews toys into pieces in < a minute
0, Not very strong or durable at all: I've yet to find a soft dog toy that my Springer Spaniel won't destroy. I bought a few of these hoping they would work. My dog did love them
1, Great for Biologists: Extensive keys
0, Dissapoint for this book: I read the recommendation from Amazon
1, Not just for Christmas: I have been listening to this album for almost 10 years. I wore out my tape copy from constantly studying to it in college and had to replace it with a CD. It is wonderful all year
0, Dangerous Product!!!: I purchased the Vtech 2421 as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It worked for 3 days and then stopped. She then let it charge for 24 hours before attempting to use it again and when she tried
1, V-Tech expandable phones: I have this set. I actually have the base one with 2 expandables. I love it
0, Grat success for an awful playing: Why is this low level saxophonist so well-succeeded with famous cd-labels? It's a mystery
0, There are really good classical saxophonists
1, Awesome: I have a tub that is about 6 inches higher than a normal tub so I use this every bath time and it saves my knees and elbows!!! I just store it in the tub when I'm not using it. I highly recommend this product.
0, Purchased on-line
1, Mesmerised
1, Great book!: Another great book in this series. I had never read any of Burrough's books before starting this series
1, One of the great
0, Standardized beauty: 2 1/2Not an entirely unsuccessful disc of pop-rock from these sensitive Swedes
1, We do like kent: Yes. this is like good music...swedish music
1, you dont know what you're missing: certainly a great sounding band... kind of like a mix between radiohead
1, Thank god
1, World Class!: This is by far the best book on this topic. Hard to live up to theblurbs
1, I love this book: This is a book I read over and over again. I picked it up the for the first time when I was 15 years old. It was required reading in English class. Being a cynical teenager
0, Book Review for English class.: do not recommend this book to anybody for a number of reasons. First of all
0, Well written but can we say rambling and slow???: This book has no point! George Eliot was a great author and wrote it really well
0, I hate this book: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The entire thing is practically one long sentence.
1, Well written book: This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people
0, great writer
0, Sluggish at best: I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep. It does have a theme and a moral
1, Ah
0," Don't Buy: This thing couldn't find a stud if it were placed on top of one without a wall seperating it. I get readings all over a wall like there are studs everywhere. A true piece of junk. I followed the instructions and nothing worked. The only reason I give it one star is because I can't give it a ""no star""."
1, Songbird: I absolutely love this CD. It took me forever to find it and was lucky to locate it at Amazon. It arrived in perfect condition! I may need to get it again soon as I listen to it so often!
0, ALL OF JOHN WAYNE'S LONE STAR-MADE WESTERNS ARE THE SAME: A YOUNG MAN NAMED RANDY [JOHN WAYNE] GETS ACCUSED OF MURDER WHEN HE WALKS INTO A CORPSE-FILLED SALOON. AFTER A WOMAN HELPS BUST HIM OUT OF PRISON
0, secondhand !: The translator that i recieved 
0, not what I thought it was: I needed a translator because I am attending Spanish language school in Central America. I bought this and thought it would be good for what I needed it for. I regret buying it
1, Translator: Product was just as describe
1, Just what I needed: This charger is just what I needed for my Garmin Street Pilot c550. I was tired of turning on my computer just to charge the GPS after a long drive. This just plugs into the power socket and charges the device very quickly. You can also use the device while it is charging. One month old and I'm very happy with it.
1, Order a larger size!: I ordered a 36 because I wear 36 Levis and I have to use the very last hole on the belt. I should have ordered a 38
1," This is the book I was looking for: With all the UML/OOP books on the market none of them are of a ""modeling to coding"" style - until now. Jacquie Barker explains concepts very well (something that is very difficult to do especially with Java/OO). And this book will show you how to model"
0, Big disappointment: I got this book and went through it before I took a Java programing class because the premsie of it is that you should learn object design before programing language. Without a knowledge of Java
0, Good explanations but a faulty premise: Being new to both Java and OO
1, It shows you the picture on the box: Many books give you the pieces of the puzzle
0," Endangered Feces: I got this out of the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. It was worth every penny and less. Lorenzo Lamas's career has managed to dig below its nadir. to. In a career of bad project choices I think that Lorenzo Lamas has reached his peak. I'll bet Steven Sagal passed on this. Did I say passed? I meant to spell it with an ""i."" The dialogue was Gawd-Awful. There were chunks of exposition that were there just to fill in the backstory for viewers. It must have been as excruciating to act in this embarrassment of a film as it was to watch. Doctor Frankenstein couldn't bring this script to life. I have training in hazmat and even I wouldn't approach this if I knew how toxic it was."
0, Pathetic: Couldn't pay me $18.49 to own this. If you want Hollywood to up the quality level of movie entertainment
0, What a piece of junk: Lets get a very poor computer simulation of a giant shark jumping out of the water and bring down a commercial 737 airplane. Wow!!!!SURE LOOKED REAL TO ME. Everything in this movie is bad except Debbie Gibson (She's pretty) but she can't act. She should have stuck to singing. Lorenzo Lamas must have had some important bills to pay and was desperate for money. Why else would he or anyone else want to be in this trash can of a film. You want to see the movie. Look at the cover. That's about as good as it gets
1, excellent: I have 20 years with something like this
1, Great Product: Great product. I have used Nivea cartridges for my Norelco shaver for 10 years. Couldn't live without it.
1," Poetry for everyone: This was a wonderful collection. I read it all the way through at once and then went back and read each poem more slowly. They were all good and I espically enjoyed ""Light at the End"
1," The Catastrophist represents the new wave of Irish writers.: Ronan Bennet has written an Irish classic. It is not Joyce's ""Ulysses"" nor does it even remotely resemble ""Angela's Ashes"". There is no famine or sectarian violence but rather the heart and soul of the Irish diaspora. The famine and troubles of Ireland are evident in the narrator's soul as his internecine relationship with his Communist lover spins wildly out of control. The historical background of the Congolese civil war provides a palpable feel to the book. His search and pursuit of his lover into Patrice Lumamba's Congo is not contrived. I would recommend this book to anyone and I hope that Ronan Bennet writes another soon."
0, Junk: Wretched little ditties by Cutesy-Pie Paulie
0, Great Ideas!: Great ideas although the one project I wanted to do which was the beveled glass ornaments looked simple enough but
0, Poorly Made: My 3yr olds broke this toy the by the end of christmas day. The microphone stand snapped off and the seat doesnt hold up to movement while sitting on it. You'd think the manufacturer would realize 3-6yr olds dont sit still.
0, Broken almost out of the box: The microphone stand broke at the joint the first time a kid over the age of three touched it. I would rather visit the dentist for a root canal than have to deal with Kids Station customer service again. There is no way to order the part online or over the phone - requests have to be sent in in writing
1, Awesome toy!: My boys
0, Broken Mic and Mic Stand: Agree with all other reviews. Kid enjoys the keyboard but also gets frustrated when the glued together mic stand breaks again and again...the mic itself only works intermittently...this also causes frustration. This would get a 1 star but because she enjoys it for the brief moments that it works and before the mic stand collapses
0, I can't believe this is a little tikes product: This is the worst little tikes item I have ever purchased. I don't care if it only cost $30. With a name like little tikes you expect a lot better quality than this. We own many
0, died fast: I got this drive with other components as I put together my home PC. The drive worked great for ~6 months and then it just died. I could not burn anything but coasters
1," Tasty: I didn't realize ""plus"" was higher in fat and calories"
1, Very Nice: This CD falls somewhere between pop and pop-rock. Easy listening
1, Best lube ever!: This lube is great for any purpose. My wife and I love it. What makes it perfect is it isn't sticky at all
1," Snowflake Bentley was a remarkable man!: I ran across a book of ""Snowflake Bentley"" snowflakes many years ago. Imagine staying outside in the cold"
1, Tough read
1, Decorate Your Garden: Lots of gorgeous color photos showing ways to spice up your garden with objects such as steel wire garden furniture

0, Great magazine
1, THIS BOOK ROCKS
1, totally aquarius: i knew this book was good because i am aquarius and it said real and good stuff about me.and also about my friend who is a cancer and a libra.
0, Dont waste your time it aint as good as you may imagine: First of all i thought this was a good album. I liked the singles Gimmie the light and Get Busy but that was about it.I was under the impression that with 20 tracks and a good beat this may be a good album guess i was wrong cause these layed out songs will put you to sleep my advice is to not buy this load of crap and download the singles cause that is the only thing good bout this cd and this is the truth.
1, Good Breakthrough Effort: If you like contemporary Dancehall music you won't regret picking up this album. Its fun to listen to
0, Umm: Yeah... usually if you wanna be a success in US you'd wanna know how to fully speak English first...
0, YOU ARE NOT BLACK SEAN PAUL!!!: I get so sick and tired of all these wiggers that are coming out of the woodwork now adays.This no talent loser is the justin timberlake of reggae.This album is boring and sean pauls voice truly annoys me.There are no good songs on here and it plainly sucks.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
1, this cd is awesome: i dont understand why people are sayin anything bad about this cd. if you buy it
0, WACK WACK WACK: This guy is not Hiphop he is an embarasment to the world of Hiphop. I am beyond tired with Daddy Yankit
0, This is NOT Reggae: This is NO Reggae. Benes Hammond is real Reggae
1, Another Must Have: Expensive
1, Will is back!: Ive been a Will Smith fan since I heard Miami. Ihavent bought a CD since Big Willie Style but I did enjoy the singles. This CD is truly great. Here is my opinion:Here He Comes--Great IntroParty Starter --Really good song 8/10Switch-GREAT! 10/10Mr. Nice Guy-10/10Ms Holy Roller-9/10Lost and Found-10/10Tell Me Why-10/10I Wish I Made That-8/10Pump Ya Brakes-9/10If You Cant Dance-9/10Could You Love Me-9/10Loretta-9/10Wave Em off-8/10Scary Story-7/10Switch R&B; Remix-5/10(original better)Bonus Track-Switch Remix 8/10
1, Will Smith; Lost Or Found: While there are several excellent songs on this CD
0, Should have stayed lost: I like Will Smith as an actor but that doesn't change the fact that he can't rap to save his life. This isn't rap
0, LOST AND FOUND IN THE TRASH!!!!: I guess all humans cannot hear the same because this cd is complete TRASH!!!! I had no idea that Will was still rapping.
1, Better than the last two albums: I really enjoyed this album very much
0, Waste of Money!!!: I bought 1
0, Function is good
1, good stuff!: this book is really interesting... particularly if you're doing a project on propaganda or nazis. It gives insight on often neglected areas of politics- music. The accompanying CD is also a plus. The songs are really interesting (if sometimes distasteful).
0, Difficult: My first Barbara Vine book
1, Reggaeton de la vieja escuela: Si te gusta lo que el reggaeton ha dejado y representa para sus seguidores...este album (CD) tiene esa energia que se requiere para ese perreo!Yo vengo siguiendo el reggaeton desde su comienso y para mi Hector y Tito son unos de los pioneros que han hecho de este genero
1, So You Want To Learn CSS?: This book has to be the best Dhtml/CSS book on the market. I have gone from knowing nothing about CSS to learning how to create effective pages using this wonderful new tool. FrontPage users: don't be afraid of investing some time with this book & learning CSS- with the new CSS/Dhtml features in 2002
1, We REQUIRE our employees to read this book!: As a Web Design firm
1, My son loves this!: It is the best of the best intros for the wrestlers! It's pretty rockin'! (Generation gap included!!)He doesn't watch wrestling any longer(outgrew it)
1, super light
1, Definitely worth it: These gloves really do the job for me: keeping my hands warm on chilly days
1, Great product
0, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD:: I was very disappointed. It was extremely repetitive
1, Not Self-Help
0, All Jerry
1, Results of Deliberqate Intent: I am livng proof that if you truly have the intent on achieving an objective it can happen. It my take time
1, Great choice for those looking for a life changing approach to life!: I have read a few of Jerry and Esther's books
0, Buy something funny instead of this album: The album just isn't funny.It's not smart
1," This is comparable to Mr. Show: David Cross's ""Shut up you f**king baby is a very funny cd. it has to do a lot with things like politics concerning 9/11"
1, Excellent Satire: If you liked his HBO special
0, Isn't comedy supposed to be funny?: If you lined up all of the humourous material on the 2 CD's
0, I'm not sure I have the same CD....: This CD is by far the worse comedy CD I have ever listened to. Period
0, A Christmas song by a german boygroup: I think that the boyz aren't better or worse than for instance he Backstreet boys. But there songs are usually a lot more catchy. This is a ballad but it's by far not their best song.The single includes 5 songs. The radio vrersion
1, Very well made musical film.: Pink Floyd The Wall is in my eyes
1, Great movie. Very disturbing.: First of
1, The sum of Roger Waters' aggression and frustration.: It seems that the tighter the grip Roger Waters had on Pink Floyd
1," The Best Rock Opera Ever: What more is there to say? This movie rocks. It is an excellent film adaptation/complement to Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" album"
1, loved it: perfect for the time pink floyd was on top gilmour on guitar is always welcome and the best of the best. the movie is good but I onlt got it for the music. since I love floyd
0, Pink Floyd The Wall: I can not watch the film as it is the wrong regional code.I do not recollect any instructions regarding this when ordering this
0, Horrible: A lousy movie
0, This movie screwed my life up: This movie screwed my head up.You probably have to be stoned to wach this.I will never look at anything the same again.
1, DVD version a must-have for fans: This DVD has lots of great extras as well as an impressive menu interface. I think it's worth for the commentary provided by author/writer Roger Waters in and of itself.
1," An excelent gift for any floydian: This edition of Pink Floyd - The Wall contains a saucerful of secrets (not to be confused with ""A Saucerful of Secrets"")"
0, Not the Same: I am a huge Pink Floyd fan but I have to admit
1, Good movie to watch: I remember I first seen Pink Floyd: The Wall back in my sophomore year of high school when I was 16 years old. This movie takes me back when I started listening to Pink Floyd again in 2005
1, An Audio/Visual Masterpiece!: The Wall has to be the most awe inspiring Movie ever put on film. The haughtingly beautiful music and stunning visuals would be enough in itself to classify this as a monumental achievment in movie making. Add Pink into the mix with his tormented mind and his own emotional rollercoaster and you have one of the true masterpieces of all time. I can't wait to see and feel this movie again on DVD.
1, If I had my way
1, Same as the last DVD release but still a great film: If you are a fan of this film
1, What A Film!!!!!: This is one of my favorite films
0, Was hoping for more.: I bought this based on the good reviews posted here on Amazon but was very disapointed. While it was great to see legendary racers like Hill and Stewart
1, The Mitford Years
0, Poor durability: While this slide is a lot of fun
1, Comics come to life: I was pleasently suprised by the quality and presentation of the formerly paper story books on the small screen. The voice acting of the characters is suprisingly good given the cheezy
0, Disappointed: the title of the book is very attractive
1, SONIC DVD REVIEW: I think that this is a great series and I am really glad to finally own it! Plan on buying the Sonic Underground series very soon! Anyone that is a fan of Sonic needs to buy this!!
1," The only good Sonic cartoon.: I loved this show when I was a kid. I would wake upe very Saturday morning to watch it. I hated when they stopped making new episodes and the ""Adventures of Sonic"" show came out and was just a silly show vs how dark this one was for a kid's cartoon.I got it to watch with my girlfriend's son"
1, this IS the biggest jaw dropper since the sixth sense: the skeleton key stars hudson as caroline
1, What you don't believe...well
1, WOW! It Was Actually Good!: Hey I can't believe it. I saw it
1, Fun: I was a student of Tulane University for five years and in that time got to soak up a lot of Louisianna atmosphere. I graduated a few months before Katrina
0, More Hollywood horror: If it wasn't for the great cast
0, The KEY to NOWHERE: - There is no suspense and no thrilling.- There is too little material for the actors to work on.- My friend and I watched it in the theatre. What a waste of money.
1, it was actually good ...who would have thought...: Chilling and SuspensefulThis movie was amazing and frightening. It's about a woman living in an old mansion where she faces ghosts and hoodoo
0, What the...: The Exterminator was one of my favourite 80s revenge films. Violent & gritty
0, Night Trilogy is better: This is an author I hold with great respect. However
0, I could not make myself finish this book: I have read- and loved- several Anne McCaffrey books
0, Poor Quality: This book was very hard to understand. It had sections that were poorly organized with a total disregard for extensive examples. Examples that were shown were not only short
0, Wasnt' What I Expected: when i opened the package i was expecting an assortment of drum stick wraps...cause that is what the picture is. What i got was single package with a design that wasn't even pictured in the ad
1, Great For Model Railroading: I'm using it to glue foam roadbed to Styrofoam and it works great. I only put the glue on the roadbed and it's holding great.
1, Different Folksongs: A very pleasing collection
1, Last Christmas: I love the song
0, Intersex is NOT transgender: The author of this book incorrectly includes infants born with genetic conditions under the transgender term. Intersex conditions are those in which an infant is born with sex chromosomes or sexual reproductive organs that are not exclusively male or female. Their condition is about sex
0, Warning: Only 1 Ladytron Song on this Album: I was pleasantly surprised to see a new Ladytron CD in the record store so I grabbed it and bought it. I was deceived. This is an album of songs which influenced Ladytron not a Ladytron album. I am so disappointed. There is one song by them on the album but that was available prior. Be sure to look at the song listings prior to jumping on this. If you like compilations
0, AWFUL: My title sums it up. This movie struck us as sad and drawn out. The ending though satisfying is preceeded by a series of rather shocking scenes. It caught us totally unawares. I shall never watch this movie again.
0, Lid doesn't seal.: I needed an outdoor food storage container for my dog. The first one I received the lid would not fit. It would not snap shut let alone provide an airtight seal as it claimed. I received a second one and at least the lid would snap shut on the front. However
1, The best: After spinning for 15 years and owning a handful of decks I have a pair of these in my home studio and I love them. I use them for spinning as well as hifi listening and they excel at both.
1, very delayed
0, Duets?: First the popular singer sings
0, Didn't work for me: I looked forward to this CD but on listening found it very disappointing. I don't think Pavarotti's booming tenor blended at all well with any of the other artists
0, Needs to Strengthen Itself: This book was not very well written. I thought that the regimen was way too easy and that the programs moved along at a terribly slow pace. Also
0, Heat? You gots to be kiddin'.: If you love
0, The Heat is not what it warmed up to be: The heat is by far not one of Toni Braxton's best album's. I loved Secrets
1, Toni's Back!: It took a long tome for Toni Braxton to get back into the music secne again. But now that's she's back
0," Spanish Guitar...typical Toni by far.: I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially ""Speaking In Tongues"" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what ""Speaking in Tongues is)"
1, Ooh Ahhh La La La - Toni's Done It Again ! AND ...: I LIKE IT ! It is so refreshing to consistently hear good music from an artist. I think it starts with a smart artist who knows how to choose good writers to work with and good music to sing to. It definitely works with this album. I had to listen to it a couple of times before it grew on me but when it did - I fell in love with it. I like the instrumental
0, poor quality blades: The first blade out of the pack separated at the welds immediately. I'm on the second one now. For this much money they shouldn't fall apart.
1, A most necessary tool: For anyone who has been in the need for a tool that will do precisely as described then this is the one.. I had a RotoZip tool that I used with minimal results and with the cost of the blades and their limited life span I was glad to find this tool. If you ever had the need to do a flush cut or a plunge cut through a 2x4 or a stair tread I would suggest giving this tool a try. I now use it for just about any type of cutting
0, Multimaster Blades: I've had my Multimasterm for six months. I love the tool concept and I have been using it quite a lot for a Kitchen and Bath remodel. My only complaint is that the blades dull very easily and are very expensive to replace. I just purchased another set of e-cut blades and one is already dull after cutting through a couple of nails.
1, No other choice: The Fein replacement blades are so expensive; but they work. Have been unable to find another product that does the job as Fein. Unique expensive product that works.
0, Fein Multimaster E-cut 1 3/8 inch sawblade: I tried my brand new Fein Multimaster just out of the box with the Precision E-cut 1 3/8 inch blade to trim some 5/16 inch bolts. After about a minute of buzzing the bolt and little cutting progress
0, Not the right connection: Using the search tool provided by Amazon I selected the Year
1, Nice album.: I like all the songs on this album. I often use it to warm up before a dance workout. It's nice combination of slow and fast music. Gypsy Caravan rocks!
1, Cats Eye Stud Earrings: Product looks exactly as represented
0," Nostalgia was better than this album...: The songs sounded better in my memory than the actual tracks on this album. I don't have the ""original"" recordings"
1, to what we shall believe...: The Box was one of Canada's greatest pop bands circa 1984-1990. They put out 4 studio albums
0, Knorr Garlic mini cubes first ingredient is salt and then MSG: Monosodium glutamate (MSG) can trigger headaches and other symptoms in some people.Aw...then we get some garlic powder among other fillers after salt and MSG. There are much better
1, It works!!!: You can actually improve your visual acuity and ditch your glasses. I'm living proof!!!!!Practice reading-scanning characters on a calendar/Snellen card/etc... concentrate on distinguishing the boundaries character-background (they should be in contrasting colors
0, Missing the eye exercise Chart!!!: I heard about this book from Dr. Mercola
0, Don't buy this book - get this other one instead!: This book will not help you improve your vision. Buy this other book instead: *The Myopia Myth: The Truth about Nearsightedness And How to Prevent It*.
0, Are these people crazy?!: I'm not kidding
1, 4.5 stars. what legends are made of...: upside: i usually dont go for the supernatural/horror genre
1, Great Book: Fantastic book
0, NOT so great.: I purchased this book since the movie was good. I figure the book would be even better. I was so wrong. Of course
1, Matheson's Legend: Matheson is a master craftsmen of the sci-fi and horror genre. This novel is no exception and is my favorite thus far. Only four stars though because the ending left something to be desired
1, I love this book!: This book surprised me and intrigued me from the first page to the very last. You really feel like you are inside the head of the main character. I enjoyed the psychological aspects of the book as well as the overall feeling you get when you read it. It made me think more about human nature and I shall be reading it again. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
1, Phenomenal: Matheson is the godfather of modern vampire horror
0, I Am Legend: I was under the impression that this was a novel. The book doesn't let on that it was a compilation of short stories. So
1, I Am Legend-Hell House: Fast paced. I couldn't put I Am Legend down. Hell House is my favorite haunted house story. It is not appropriate for young adults
1, An amazing read: This is a hugely absorbing and very intelligent read. What would happen if the world as you know it ended
0, Blah.: This story neither gathered my attention
0," 30-Year Audiobook Listener: The ""I Am Legend"" disaster-wipes-out-most-of-mankind story is mildly interesting"
1, A recording for the principles: This is a fine recording if you admire the voices of the three principles: Hampson
0, Poor quality and extremely disppointed: I bought this custom for my son. Before I placed the order
0, Jedi knight costume: Very disappointed with this purchase. Velcro hanging off. Not well put together at all
0, Poor workmanship and design not similar to the picture: I ordered this costume for my boy's starwar birthday party but was quite disappointed with the followings:-1. The workmanship of this costume is poor.2. No seam sewing.3. Not true to size
1, great made in usa quality: a great tool for those of us moving endless amounts of snow. Should last a lifetime. way better than foreign made disposeable junk found at your local mega mart.
0, Boring
1, Beautiful Shoe: As usual Aerosole has made another unique fashionable yet comfortable shoe. I bought the gold color and get comments everytime I wear. Although I would not want to go all day shopping with this shoe
1," Deeds for California Real Estate: Book is very helpful and provides all kinds of sample formsand websites to download forms needed to change existing deedsor create new ones. Very easy to ""do it yourself"" and save $."
1, Couldn't find another place to ask
1, A must read: This is a superb nostlagic story of a boy and his childhood. It describes his beautiful village
0, Why do y'all like this book so much?: I read this book a few years ago for my English Class
1, Memories: it has been about fifty years since i read this book
0, An Unnatural Book...: A grave disservice is being done to the earnest and hard-working Cryptozoologists worldwide everytime a newcomer to the subject cracks this book open. Not only is the book inaccurate in the valid facts it contains
0, Very Bummed Out!: This is a great concept. I thought my two year old would enjoy riding a scooter like her big sister and the picture looked very durable. However after assembling this toy we were bummed out
0, without a box it couldn't be returned: My 20 month old daughter recieved this scooter for Easter from her grandparents. They were being helpful by putting it together at home before giving it to her. When she sat down she became very frustrated by the fact she wasn't going anywhere. She had the right idea
0, No Good - Waste of money!: It's boring
0, I agree - Wheels Suck: My daughter received the scooter for her second birthday and luckily we have a gift receipt. It will be going back. The toy is very well made. However
1, Dance Party Music: I first heard this album in the parking lot across the street when there was a block party. It rocks. Jive Bunny is a disc jockey who uses parts of both Big Band and rock music to create a lively synthesis. It's one of those CDs you could put on when you want to pick up the moment. Unusual blending of big band and Little Richard works well. You may not like every cut on the album
0, Love the concept! Hate reading it.: Yes
1, The review...: Greetings All
1, As funny now as when it firsted aired: I love these old TV shows. This did not disappoint. This DVD set will appeal to all ages. I can't wait until the rest of the sets come out along with the (2) full length movies that were created at the same time as the show was running. I highly recommend.
1, One of the Best: I was really happy to see this series come out on DVD. In my opinion
1, Read This One!: In some sense VAS picks up where Richard Powers's groundbreaking The Gold Bug Variations leaves off: assume that the structure of language is reflected in the double helix
0, damn 50.: Its not worth buying. this is exactly why people bootleg cds. dont get me wrong
0, Someone Tell me: After 2 years
0, too much mainstream: we've heard all of this once why would we wanna hear it all again on his 2nd CD with worse songs? just a thought
0, *Insert Pun about massacre-ing music here*: Eminem's music was not too bad
0," one star for a f*****: THIS ""MUSIC"" IS PURE SH*T AND I WISH SOME ONE LIKE SID OR COBAIN COMES AND PUT THEIR GUITARS IN THESE GUYS' AS**'S"
0, Suxs my soxs: Yea...this is by far some of the worst music (if you can even call it that) I have ever heard. I mean he doesnt even write his own songs ( as I have heard from MANY people). Weve heard it all before you say a couple rhymes and get real big...when are they gonna do something new.
0, Fifty be juicin': come on people...look at the album cover
0, BEST RAPPER EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: 50 CENT IZ DA BOMB!! HE IZ MY FAV RAPPER OV ALL DA TIME!!!!! HE IZ EVAN BETTA DAN EMINEM AND KAYNE WEST WICH R OLSO GOOOOD!!!!! DA SONG CANDY SHOP IS DA BEST SONG EVA!!! AND I LOVE HIS KLIPS!! PICK UP DIS ALBUM AND HIZ PEVIOUS GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN DEY R DA BEST ALBUMS OV ALL DA TIME!!!!! FORGET 2PAK AND PABLIK ENAMY DEY R POZERS AND R NO MACH FOR 50 CENT!!!!!If you are a 50 cent fan then you probably believed that. All I have to say about this album has already been said
1, SHUT UP: SHUT UP!!! Stop dissen the album just cuz he goes after Nas
0, I'm not even jokin w/ this score: I popped this CD in w/ an open mind. I tried to like listening to evry gangsta rap cliche in the book
0, horrible: This album takes the word horrible to a brand new level. It is a prime example of what is happening to rap. The only thing 50 raps about other than himself are his material possesions and hoes. This is the worst album I have ever listened to.My friend burned this for me right after it came out. I listened to it once
0," Terrible: This album is terrible. 50 Cent feels that he can put out anything and it will sell. There are no songs I can vibe to except ""Hate It or Love It Remix."" ""Piggybank"" is the worst diss song I have ever heard. Please do not buy this album"
1, It's AIGHT.: I have no idea why people been dissin this CD
0, just under average: i gave this album less than 3 stars because it has more bad songs than good ones.i think there are many tracks 50 shuldve left out.some of the songs aren't bad and have a real grimy feeling to it like get in my car
0, No: This album is less signifigant than a hair on my left nut. Am I the only one that notices that 50 doesn't even try? It seems like all his verses are all one word. And I'm no fan of anyone he disses
0, Disgusted: I am not really into Hip Hop but I can tell that you 50 is trash and he only cares about money. I cant even fathom why people compare him to Tu pac who was brilliant at what he did and was a true poet with his words. He is to rap what Madonna and Michael are to pop and what Elvis/The Beatles/Aerosmith and so on
0, Dirtier Grimier
1, Break it down: hey guys: break it down for what it is. I listen to eminem because of his lyrics. I listen to 50 for the same reason. This CD has been bashed and praised. Listen to the entire CD
1," Entertaining but not Thought Provoking.: Well after the humongous success of 50 cent's first ablum it was gonna be nearly impossible for him to top it and naturally he didn't. What he did do was put out an enjoyable and highly entertaining cd. The lyrics and flows are sub par but he makes up for it with sticky chorus hooks that you'll be singing for days. At least he knows his strengths. I think my only problem with the cd is the infamous track ""Piggy Bank"". As diss songs go it's not ""Ether""..it's not even"
1, This CD is hot from start to Finish: I think most people can agree that this isnt as good as GRODT. But give credit were credit is due. This CD will be one of if not the best rap albums of the year. Every song is hot and his lyrics are sick
0, Horrible.: This CD is horrible. 50 Cent really has gotten into the brains of children and alienated them into a sick world. Don't buy this CD...dont support communisim.
0, I GUESS THEY WOULD GIVE A RECORD DEAL TO ANYONE THESE DAYS. TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have never heard such garbage. Nuff said.
0, This Album Sucks: Listen people
0, Sigh: Can aftermath disappoint me anymore? First Eminem drops his worst album ever
1, Better than the first: wow this cd is The best. It might have some bad songs but Gatman that was funny and My toy soldier is a great song along with outta control
0, 50 Cent - The Massacre: Sorry
0, Pathetic: This album is a pathetic example on how mainstream music has gone to hell in the past five or six years. I don't normally listen to rap
0, YUCK Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)'s Free Me album is way better: I have bought all the tune in tuesdays this year and so far the best one is Emma Bunton - Free Me. Former Baby Spice From The Spice Girls. Now If Emma Did a Better job than 50 Cent than he's got a Problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0, 0.0stars: The worst put together album of all time. I like real music. This really is absolute crap. If you like this you are obviously a white kid from the burbs.
0, 50 Cent Is The HUSTLA: Well of course this album is suppose to be bad. 50 Cent has already made his riches off his first album. He knows that he has drew in enough hype to sell his records no matter how terrible they are and he's going to use that to his advantage. People need to realize that the music industry is corrupted. Music has become nothing more then a money making scheme that diminishes people. You think 50 really cares what people think of this album? I don't think so. Obviosuly he doesnt care about the album because it's trash. He is getting paid regardless and he will continue to get paid because he has someone else always promosing him this and that if he keeps doing what he do.
0, whack......: first this guy is nothing but a snitch. Second the game rips him and all of G-unit on 300 bars and runnin and 50's best comeback was 300 shots with 8 others on the track hahahah how whack and it couldnt even touch games diss. All you lil whack mofos think 50's hard he aint nothin but pop music and he will never be one of the best mc's. if you want real music you should have picked up AZ-A.W.O.L. instead of this bs G-G-G-G-G UNOT
0, Given a chance.: This collection of rhymes is repellant
1, STOP ALL THE HATING!: You can hate it or Love it. It does not matter Shady/Aftermath/G-unit is running rap period..50 makes hit records. He has a talanted crew and no one can mess with them..As far as Piggy Bank goes Jada and Fat Joe were dissing 50 for a while on the mixtapes he is just responding..Plus this will help Jada boost his sales since he cant seem to hit the million copies mark..If he is so good why cant he sell a million? Fat Joe sucks and should not respond to 50. And make was not loyal so he is OUT! what a stupid move on games part he should have kept quiet and and not got involved with 50's beef.
0, I can't believe how dense some of you people are...: Vlad
0, Weak: This cd don't even compare to Get Rich Or Die Trying. He say its better and Tony Yayo say its 10x better than the 1st one too. That's why all the stuff happened to hype it up like they did the first cd and it worked. But this cd is WEAK so don't waste your time or money.
0, Not worth your money: I hate Fat Joe
1, 50 comes back for another round: Since his first album sold 11 million I didn't expect this could top it and I guess everything has lived up to my expectations. The album is fairly solid. Its got some really strong songs namely
0, Deserves 0 Stars: meaningless pointless no good full of cursing music. need i say more? if you wanna hear some great music
0, Doesn't even deserve a full sentence: its garbage!
1, Good
0," This album sound like his last one: This CD was worse than 50's ""Get Rich..."" Jada tells it how it is""You ain't get shot again yet"
0, Wow the talent here is amazing!!!!: When will you inner city thugs realize that talking into a microphone over a drum machine is not music. Werd to your mutha yo. Peace in the middle east G money posse. Booyeeeee!!!
1, A Musician Plays Beethoven: For years
1, Low cost USB M-F cable: Plain generic cable that works perfectly. Cost about 1/5 of what you would pay at a name-brand store but without all the fancy packaging.
1, A really good read: Highly recommended. I am from California and as much as I didn't want to think that we will hit a snag in our social progress as being 'out' and that the community would once be ashamed of who they are (prior to the island development
1, Must read: Uplifting
0, Very difficult to follow. Highly advise to find another book: I am a 4.0 engineering major and I found this book to be one of the worst I have come across. I spent more time trying to figure out how the author got from point A to point B in his derivations than I did learning the material. It is not clearly written. Find another book!
1, Decent boots: I switched out my military issue jump boots for a pair of these Bate's zip-sided Enforcers. The construction is solid
1, A good place to start: This book is an excellent starting point for those who wish to tackle the 70-029 exam. However
1," Excellent overview of a ""watch"": The more I read"
1, Romance that whispers to your heart: Unforgettable is so different from Ms. Smith-Brown's last book Plantation. A romantic suspense that kept me--as they say-- turning the pages! A warm
1, Fun
1, Huge Rosie Fan!: I Love Rosie and this is the best Christmas CD of 1999! I can't wait until next Christmas for her next CD!
1, Works good!: My boyfriend is a drummer and he's really hard on his sticks. AND despite the fact that he's an amazing drummer he's still really clumsy..hence his sticks flying out of his hands in the middle of a gnarly breakdown... these sticks help him from throwing them at his bandmates and helps protect the sticks aswell!
1, The first Berenstain Bears book.: This is the first Berenstain Bears book that I got for my daughter when I was expecting her brother. She loved it and now I have gotten it for my granddaughter who is waiting for her little sister to arrive. My daughters said that when she read it to her it brought back good memories of when I read it to her. Love this book.
1, This book is good for small children.: This is book is good for small children
0, Do Not Buy This Edition: This 2010 General Books edition of the Belloc classic is terrible quality
1, this is a good book!: I never wanted to read this until I borrowed it from a friend. Now

1, A must have: A wheelchair cushion is a must have

1, A Christmas Story for Kids.: MY FIRST STORY OF CHRISTMAS is a book geared towards younger children that tells the story of Jesus' birth. The book is written in a very simple and straitforward manner. Other than the usual vocabulary associated with Christmas (manger
1, pleasure: This is a fantastic movie. Am very happy with the quality of the film and higly recommend this product. Have not been disappointed with anything I have bought from Amazon.
0, Do not pay to download this!: Do not pay to download this article. Why
1, Love Those Hounds: This is another favorite album for me. You're not going to get better from an artist than a song like Running Up That Hill. And as someone who has a lot of inner struggles
1, Awesome album!: I am a more casual Kate Bush fan
1," Holds Up Remarkably Well: Kate Bush is often compared to Peter Gabriel (she even sings a duet with him on ""Don't Give Up"" from his SO album). The comparison is epecially appropriate here: HOUNDS OF LOVE has the theatrics of early Genesis and the world-beat percussion of Gabriel's later work"
0," Not her best by a long shot: This album always leaves me with mixed feelings. ""Running Up That Hill"" I find tedious and repetitive (though it's the best song here). The entire first side sounds like an introduction to drum machine programming. To my ears"
0, Low quality product: My nephew really loved
1, Fun for Star Wars fans: This is a great little cape. My son didn't take it off for days. He even slept in it! It is very lightweight and not very durable so be aware that the description is not acurate. Still
0, Might as well be written by Castro himself: This book is propaganda pure and simple. I had to read this for a poli sci class last semester and it is horrible. It begins with the increaing interest in Marxism and socialism. And then goes on to profile che guvara and Castro and the implications for socialism after the 5 billion dollar subsidies dried up after the early 1990's.Don't waste your time buying or reading this extremely short and biased work. Their is no information and only tiny philosophical reasons why communism didn't fail after the U.S.S.R fall. Very short and biased and contains nothing of substance. Also very expensive for what amounts to propaganda.
0," A Major Disappointment: I preordered this book based on its advance publicity. It was a major disappointment. Written in the style of an extended ""People Magazine"" article"

0, I couldn't watch the whole movie: This has to be the slowest
0, Would not recommend!: While I was serving in Iraq I had purchased a Coleman air mattress and it did wonders for the whole year that I was there. Once I returned I purchased another Coleman but in a bigger size for the guest room in my apartment which also did wonders. I am staioned in Germany and often travel to the states to visit my family and decided to puchase this Intex air mattress as something I could sleep on for whenever I'm there visiting. BIG MISTAKE!!! The first night I slept on it there weren't any problems

1," Fir those not wanting to read a TON about this album: For those not wanting to read 12 pages about this album.Read this. Its a very melodic and great NIN album. The lyrics are in rule in power to this album unlike past albums where it was a combonation of creative music and lyrics. Trent did a great job with ""right where it belongs"". The plot of that song pretty much sums up the albums plot and overall message. In other words its worth the money. Seeing is u can find that amount in change in your couch."
1," ""sunspots cast a glare in my eyes"": My opinion is this is a good summer album"
0, KILL ME! KILL ME! KILL ME!: I am an avid fan of Nine Inch Nails. And simply put this is the most worthless album next to an avril lavigne album. I am no music connoiseur. Not even sure if i spelled that right. But comparatively
1," a step down but satisying enough: as a long time fan of NIN i consider this to be a step down from previous works but still found it satisfying enough.trent uses techno beats but still seems to make it work.i guess why i give it only **** is because it isn't as memoreable as other albums.the lyrics didn't speak to me as much and eventhough it's almost an hours worth of material it seemed to me to go by too quick.now this isn't neccessarily a bad thing it's just that...maybe it's because to me most of the songs are 'same sounding' and not as easy to be able to tell from apart.i know this sounds like a negative review but i still do like the album.i guess it's just one of those albums that you'd expect more of from trent.i almost want to say that it's more ""poppy"" than past material"

I had 13 of them and not a one fell.

1, Great ant-free double bowl - highly recommended: It was larger than I anticipated. Overall
0, She tried too hard...and the quality of the book shows it.: The author tried too hard to create five different personalities. Her methods of doing this were crude and obvious. I rushed through this book only to fulfill a promise that I made to read it. The book isn't worth a tinker's damn.
0, I must admit I was very dispointed with this book.: I began this novel hoping to read something new and different. I am forced to admit that I gave up after 290 pages. I know
0, TRY AGAIN CAITLIN...you can do it: There is no story and the characters are boring losers
0, somewhere short of fantastic: i enjoyed the book for the most part but it was nothing that i had hoped for and was quite dissapointing as the horror didn't arise until almost the last chapter and what was the horror was hardly imaginative or well explained. overall i would say that if you're looking for vivid writing buy this book but if you're looking for horror
0, WHAT'S THE POINT: I Saw this idiotic movie
0, some good laughs on a crappy pile: why this movie was made thats up for me to find out..but anyways the jackasses are here with more gross out and stupid **it that you may or may not handle and some will find it offensive..idiots will find it funny..because they have no taste whatsoever...the funniest moment would have to be in the beginning where Johnny Knoxville rents a car and then demolishes it and returns it to the owner running away...then it gets into real lame and crappy humor.....
0," ""better than Citizen Kane""??? i don't think so...: I watched the TV show many times... i stopped watching it when I saw one of the Jackassess eating his own vomit (yeah! you readed it well)...I can't believe that someone compared this gross movie (where the Jackassess eat their own urine) with Citizen Kane."
0, Good Music - Pathetic Film: The 2 stars is for the music alone. The movie is vulgar and pointless. I'm certainly no prude
0, Moderately funny at some points
0," Always check the reviews: I will ALWAYS check with the reviews here on Amazon before I purchase another ""Classic War"" movie. I purchased this at Suncoast video and was expecting an epic WWII movie"
0, War movie?: For the first five minutes I thought that this was going to be one of the best war movies I'd ever see
1, Well done!: A great debut by a new author --- charming and delightful. I look forward to future books by Gayle Callen.
1, Miraculous: If you can imagine a great Mozart opera
0, I'll give it one more try: I suffer from motion sickness when sailing in ocean swells. Looking for an alternative to traditional seasick pills
1, The best album yet!!: I've been waiting a long time for this album
1, Finally!: YES!! Finally KoRn's 5th album is out! I must say Untouchables is awesome! It is somewhat different from KoRn's previous albums because some songs are more melodic than hardore. However
1, nearly great
0, A good band gone to waste!: DON'T BOTHER GETTING THIS! IF YOU WANT KORN GET ANY OF THE OTHER CDS BUT STAY FAR AWAY FROM UNTOUCHABLES!
1, a BEAUTIFUL ALBUM: This is an aweasome album
0, Dissappointment: This CD is a pretty big let down. I was around for the 1st Korn CD
0, Another boy band?: Since when did N'Sync start playing guitars? Oh
0, Enough Already: I can wholeheartedly say that Korn represents pure hate better than any other band currently. Unfortunately
1, ~K o r n at its best~: Great album
0, sex change: Wot has happened to the band that i loved at album one has jonathon davis had a sexchange because he souns like a girl and the whole album this continues pure assult to the ears.
1, About Time: After a series of one or two hit cd's
0, Newer
1, KoRn is back and here to stay: This is deffinetly an amazing Cd. A major improvement from iSsuEs and Follow the Leader
0, Pure Overated Crap: I wish I could give this CD 0 stars.The Fake Metal band every REAL metalhead despises is at it again with another crapfest of thrown together hooks and neverchanging guitar riffs. The drums are slow as a fricken turtle and he couldn't go any slower with those clicky ass double bass drums. Johnathan's voice couldn't get anymore annoying. He sounds like he has a twig up his ass and I want to punch him because he sucks. Fieldy is a pretty good bassist
1, KORN - THE UNTOUCHABLES.: This Korn CD rocked!!! Here To Stay is easily my favorite song on this album. I also love Thoughtless
0, Absolute GARBAGE!!: Korn is like alot of some cool fans before TRL decides to market them to snotnosed 13 year old kids who claim they are the greatest band
0, Same old
1, Untouchables: Untouchables is I think probably the best Korn album to come out since their self titles album. The 14 tracks on the new CD are heavier in the instruments and the singing by Jonathan shows that korn can change their style and make it sound great. I love this album and all of the songs are great to hand bang to. If you love Korn as much as I do then you will buy this album and you will appreciate the style that korn has created.
0, What were they thinking?: This is the most horrible cd by korn definately (Issues ... too but at least had 2 good tracks on it). Old school korn lovers will hate this album. The old harder stuff by korn is awesome....this just plain ... There isnt really a good track on the whole cd. I dont know where korn is goin with this new ... sound but they need to bury it.
0, A very un-Korn Korn album: Don't get me wrong; I love Korn to death
1," STILL TO THIS DAY: I still listen to this cd today as well as all the others. I have made my own Korn greatest hits cd and can't stop listening to it either.""Untouchables"" is one of the best albums they have had in a long time.

1, Back to heavier Korn
1, Untouchables Review: This CD
1, KoRn will never lose it: This is the Epitomy of all things KoRn. They add a new style but keep the KoRn mentality. This is definatly an all time great it has every emotion you can think of. It will always be remembered as a great album that lived up to its hype.
1, BEST KORN CD OUT OF THE FIVE: ... When Untouchables came out
1," The Evolution of KoRn: This is a beautiful record and obviously shows how far this band has come along in their musical and personal journeys. To say that this record ""is not true to the KoRn formula"" would be the same as admitting that you have never truly listened to a KoRn record before. If there is a ""KoRn formula"" it would be: NO LEAD GUITAR"
0, P.U.: I remember when Davis was interviewed for this album
1, Zelda Nintendo GameCube Bundle Review: This is an awesome game system. It has an amazing picture quality and it comes with a fantastic game. It is all around the best gamecube bundle. I like my Playstation 2 more
1, NICE!: GameCube is a must-have console.The best graphics of all the 128bit consoles!The best games of all the other Nintendo consoles!The controller is very confortable
0, Dual Disc CD won't play in many CD players: How idiotic. So far this CD ONLY plays on my computer. I have 4 other CD players
1, Wonderful!: I have played this CD nonstop for three days in a row now and I just love it more and more. The lyrics are splendid - witty
0, Disappointed in this: This cd is so bad. I only listened to it once and I never wanted to hear any of the songs again. It's almost as bad a children's cd and that is what the background music on it reminds me of. This is the kind of music that the Olsen twins would release if they ever put out an album. It is so bad. It's like she is partonising her audience with lame children like sing along songs. Please don't buy this without hearing it first. Someone got it for me because they knew I liked Fiona Apple and now I realize
0, Terrible pressing - avoid Plain Records Pressings!: I am completely disappointed in the quality of this release. This is one of my favorite albums and to hear to treatment this company
0, Fiona say it isn't so...: Maybe I had lofty expectations for this album
1, This book is a good for Nikon users; it's worth buying.: This book is very good
1, MAY BE THE ANSWER TO YOUR NIGHTMARES: The University of New Mexico (Albuquerque) did a study with a PTSD population who had terrible nightmares. The research was based on cognitive behavioral techniques and techniques from this book. Unfortunately
1, Perfecta interpretación: No tengo muchas palabras para expresar la genialidad interpretativa de esta grabación. Sólo escuchen el diálogo entre el Compositor y Zerbineta del Prólogo
0, So
1, A slice of history when baseball was a game: Not much I can say about this book. It's dated
0, learn a little first: It's probably a good thing that most conservatives don't have a sense of humor. They certainly won't use it reading this book. Go get Al Franken's book to learn something and laugh at the same time.
0, Not a good representation of conservatism...: As a conservative
0, Sad and Unfunny -- A Waste of Paper: Man
0, Tries to hard to please and falls flat: Al Franken's book was a blast that resounded because so many people took that fat windbag Limbaugh seriously. Mauro's vapid tome misses the wit and bite that Franken's had. The jokes here are entirely predictable and unfunny. Next time the conservatives should try finding someone with some verve and cleverness to write a humorous attack tome as this one just falls flat. Then again
0," They Must Have Placed The Wrong Cover on This Book: On the cover of my book it says ""Her (Iris Murdoch) wise"
1, Great case for the money: The case is very well made and has ample padding. Side pockets are roomy. Has a heavy duty zipper. I use it for a Marlin Model 60 .22 with a 3 X 9 variable scope. The case is big enough for the scope with no problem
0," Nice case...does NOT fit AK47 or 30 rd clips: Not sure what the rest of the people reviewing were thinking when they said this fits an ak47. Mine is squeezed in like a sardine. It does not ""fit"" it bulges out the sides and you have to wedge it in. This would work if you have a folding stock but not a normal butt stock. Oh"
1, great for the money: I read the reviews and was a little skeptical
1, Quality Case At A Great Price: This product was half of what most retail stores charge. It is padded on the inside to protect a scope. This is a great case for carrying to and from the range or for storing in a closet or under the bed. I dont know that I would want to throw it behind the seat of my truck and forget about it
1, single rifle case: I bought this in May of 2011 for an AR with a collapsible stock
1, Very high-value soft case: This case is great!-Thick foam padding on the sides AND bottom to protect your rifle-Five handy magazine pouches that close securely behind a velcro panel-A big
0, Not the same as pictured: I received a case that had one small zippered pocket on the side instead of the five magazine pockets that are pictured. The case would have been great if the magazine pockets were there instead of the zippered one. It fit my SW MP15MOE perfectly.I returned the item since the zippered pocket is useless.
1, Christmas Present: Got it for the fathet-in-law for Christmas. he seems to like it for his Ruger 10-22 SR. it fits well and holds his magazines.
1, Awesome: Great price for a nice simple rifle case. Fit my S&W AR-15 perfectly. Holds 30 round mags on the outside fine and shuts closed fine. no issues. You can fit the rifle with a mid-size / small scope. The bigger optics may have issues zipping up.
0, works i guess: the other day before receiving this today my friend sold me his new gun bag that he got al walmart for 26 bucks and is bigger better made and thicker padding then this one so i will be using that instead
0, to good to be true: This product is a piece of junk....the description suggests a much better quality item.The holders are not even bent consistantly.If it wasn't so inconvienient I would return it.
1, Great book even for advanced ActionScripters: I never review books on Amazon
1, Learning OOP in Flash? Get this!: Even if you have experience with OOP in other languages like C# or Java
0, book w/o cover: book took longer than I thought it would since I had paid for expidetited shipping. But included a holiday so I should have just sent it regular rate. Also
1, Grand Tour lives up to its name: I read the first edition of this book in 5th grade

1, Great workout.: I like this step DVD although you would have to be very
0, re: clinical handbook: no wonder the item was soo cheap
1, a compelling account with Haitink's trademark concentration and intensity: The review by Santa Fe Listener hits the nail right on the head.This reading is certainly not the standard pastoral approach favoured by most English conductors
1, Tasty Chunx Abound!: How fortunate was I to pick this album up the day of release! And What A Release! Lemmy & his Bruise Brothers fire off a few more rounds to nail ya down! Premier selections include: Shut Your Mouth
1, Very effective cleanser and make-up remover!: I bought this cleanser/make-up remover on a whim and am really glad I did! I am currently using non-waterproof mascara
1," Great jazz guitar & Diana Krall on one CD!: I'm a recent DK convert (thanks to my brother-in-law) but realized that I already owned a CD with her sultry crooning on it - and I didn't even know it! Mark Whitfield's soothing jazz guitar CD ""Forever Love"" has two long playing tracks with great vocals by (you guessed it) Ms. Krall. If anyone else knows of any other collaborations she's done with other artists"
1, Love Scenes Dian Krall: This is a very high quality 5.1 SACD recording which I played via my oppo SACD/DVDA/CD/DVD player
1, Lover of the finer things in life: If you're confused why 95% of listeners gave this 5 stars and 5% hated it
1, too awesome !!!!!: Her choice of song material is wonderful
1, Pinnocchio: A lovely story written by a true author. A bad disobedient boy turns into a smart
1, Loved It!!!: I saw Gunslinger Girl
0, Are you kidding?: Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Manowar fan. I put up with a lot ... from my friends because they don't like the group. I've gone to concerts by myself because no one would go with me. However
0, Only lasted two summers: I will say this trimmer ran great for two summers. It was powerful and easy to handle for this woman in her 40's. This third summer it won't stay running. I read another review with the same problem. Good trimmer for 2 summers
0, Trouble awaits: Once you have it for about 6 months it becomes the hardest starting machine I ever owned.
1, Hyperreal: L'Eclisse is shot in long takes in black/white. The picture and transfer is unearthly
0, The Book is Unreadable: This book has been produced in such a way that the words are unreadable. It is basically a worthless purchase
1, Hides my belly: I got this after I gave birth to my daughter and used it when I wear something that clings to my body. It works wonders at making my belly look flatter. It is hard to put on at first but after a while I got a hang of it. I am a size 0 from Gap and got a XS from here and it fit and works for me. It is hard to move and sit when you wear this but do make you look much much better.
1, Just Like Grandma Cooked: This book reminded me of all the traditional polish dishes my grandmother made. Just skimming through the recipes brought back the fantastic smells and tastes of her cooking.
0, This book could be a magazine article: First
1," This book I believe was a life saver. Iknow it helped us: My neighbors had some work done on their house and it ended up being quite a disaster. I saw this book advertised locally and bought it. I can pretty safely say that we eliminated some contractors because of the book that we might have hired. The one we did hire met all of the qualifications outlined in the book and we have a beautiful addition to prove it. I know that because of many things in the ""pitfall"" book we had a good remodeling experience. John Francis"

1, Creed knock off my a**: To the person that wrote the first review saying that OLP is a Creed knock
1, You won't get it the first time: Obviously
1, A watered down OLP: I bought Gravity eagerly when it came out. I was a little worried about Bob Rock being the producer (this being the same guy that ruined Metallica)
0, good idea but....: The idea of this book is great
1, Epic concert.: The concert on the first disc is definitely one of the best
1, ON THE CUTTING EDGE FOR ITS TIME...: A unique and magical meld of pop and classical strains make for an unusually compelling CD. The symphonic orchestration of the Moody Blues' music extends their range
0, don't buy kindle book!: I've made an error : don't read the one star comment! no figures for an anatomical book is ridicolous. I've paid for nothing.
1, No prescription needed -- now: After a horrendously exhausting day
1, Real good: I never could actually sit down to read those thick unabridged versions of classical lit.
1, All time great: One of the most beloved novels and a necessary component for any library. Print and format is fine for a free domain book.
1, Simply wonderful: Like all the other Jane Austen books I loved this one just as much. Jane Austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more. Trust me - you won't be able to get your hands off this classic that is still entertaining to read today. A book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
1, follow-up: Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund.
1, Student who LOVES P&P: Being a student (10th grade)
1, One of the best book I have ever read: I'm 18 and I don't read lot and I was waiting to read Emma. So I read Pride and Prejudice.I think it's a great book. I thouhgt that since it's an old book it would be boring. But it wasn'tit was great. I think the theme can still by applied in today's world.Go out and read it
1, Good so far: I am about 75% of the way through this book and can say it is enjoyable
0, pissed off: When I got this book for a Christmas I was not sure if I got the right one for my girlfriend. After she recieved it as a gift she did let me know it was the wrong one :( We contacted the lady who sold it to us and she said no return !! She was rude and I will not buy a thing from Amazon again . If you let losers like this sell things and not back it up why should I ever take the chance again ? I thought there would be a return policy. Guess there is not :( I hope no one buys from this lady again !!!
0, refers to LARGE PRINT EDITION - HarperCollins: I am returning the HarperCollins Large Print edition of Pride and Prejudice because the PRINT IS TOO SMALL for a Large Print book. I am distressed that it bears the NAVH (National Association of the Visually Handicapped) mark -- the font is clearly smaller than other
0, i would have rated this novel lower than 1*: this book was poorly written and i had trouble getting over the first page! i woke up after 10minutes and then realised that i had fallen asleep! i would recommend ppl to keep away from such a horror~ it hasn't got the right to be called a 'NOVEL'. i prefer lord of the flies. it's much more riveting~ now that deserves 5* rating
0, ugh: i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats
0, unrealistic: Of course
1, like giving your mind a spring clean: After reading so many modern fiction popular titles it is so refreshing to go back to a classic. Pride and Prejudice really is at the top of my classic favs list.
1, I still get deliciously lost in the language.: There is so much to write positively about the charm of this book. However
1, A great read: I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy
1, Enjoyable read: Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and
1, Disappointed with the illustrations: If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone
1, One of my all time favorites: As a fan of other types of literature (Stephen King and Steinbeck
0, get the free version instead: Another of amazon's bad moves is to remove all ratings from the free versions so they virtually disappear from searches. Maybe put them back guys? This is totally available for free if you search by title instead of author. This is a classic.
0, Unfortunately edited version: I love my Kindle
1, Amazing: For those of you who think that this book is boring that just means you arn't educated enough to understand it.And no I am not an adult. I am 15 years old and I loved this book so much. I have seen the movie to with Colin Firth who is so fine. And he has the most beautiful smile.But if you don't know the meaning of vex you shouldn't be juding a intelligent book
1, Absolutely loved it.: I'm not a big reader
0, Overwritten
0, An Amazon Con: An email solicitation acknowledged me as an International Amazon customer
1, Years to LOVE!: I took me years to read this book! It started when I was 12 years old
1, Classic: This is an excellent book
1, Far better than expected.: I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.
1, Pride and Prejudice is really a good book~: In my view
0, Fit for a coffee table: This book would be perfect for a coffee table. No one would ever with to talk about it. When I read it in high school I thought it to be the most boring book I ever read. I didn't care about all the people trying to be married
0, Definitely a chick book...: I tried to read it
0," This is what happens when writers are allowed to slack: This book may be considered a ""classic"" but it isn't. It may deal with ""emotions"" and ""the human spirit"" but it lacks the qualities of true literature. To be blunt"
1, Humorous
0, noisy...: This is not a good recording. Too much noise andthe voice sounds muffled. The discs are CD-Rs
1, Its a romantic book of how opposites attract.: This book is witty book which portrays a mother who is over anxious to get her 5 daughters married and trying to compete with her neighbours Sir & Lady Lucas to get her children married of before their Charlotte. Their eldest daughter Jane meets the rich yet charming Mr Bingley. Elizabeth the more level headed of the 5 Bennet daughters. Falls in love with th proud Mr Darcy. This is a book which should not be missed just because you are prejuidced of classics.
1, Jane Austen's best: First Jane Austen's book I've come across
1, Read it because she's great!: I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun
1, Great book!: Love this book! That's all I have to say about it. I knew the story really well
1, Is a classic: One of the best classic books around. A love story of classes and impossible love. I would recommend the book and see the movie.
1, One of my favorite books: This is an absolutely wonderful book! It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels
1, The best book second only to the Bible!!!!!: This romance captures you right from the beginning. Miss Austen
1, Essential.: Pride and Prejudice is my second favorite Jane Austen (Sense and Sensibility is number one) and has as fantastic characters and plot. Both are classics
0, Get the free version!!!: Do not waste your money on this! I thought i would get a book that looks like the original 1813 edition (ie.
1, Gunslinger Girl II: Great movie it closed out things from the series. I would tell anyone to get this movie. I just love it.
1, Incredible: I chose this rating because I love that the book came on time and in excellent condition and I love the fact that I passed my class with flying colors after using this book.
1, great toy: my cat loves to scratch this and I usually put in some cat nip to encourage him
0, I hate it when: the picture shown for the product doesn't represent what you will get. I ordered a two pack of these and only got one. Will never order anything else from the company that makes these.
0, Beware of misleading product description: Just received the package and was surprised to find only 2 pads. The product illustration clearly shows FOUR pads
1, cats love them
1, Great item
0, Useless.: I purchased several of these to put files in
0, Disappointing: Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers. I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times. At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com. First
1, Pretty good goa: This cd is great for the price and has some pretty good goa. Not as good as the first cd
1, till we meet again: what a wonderful first class mini series spanning two world wars and playing in some of the most exciting places in the states and europe. Hugh grant as Bruno 
1," Judith Krantz""s Till We Meet Again: The movie was almost as good as the book. I had to reread the book after receiving the movie just because I liked it so well."
0, Poor customer service: Item is not as nice as it appears. Company was completely unresponsive. Don't recommend.
0, Lots of gore but not too much more.: This movie delivered gore and all that but the script is stupid
0, Horrible low budget stinker: This straight to dvd movie is about as low budget as it gets. At first I thought one of the supporting characters had killed her off. Then the movie moves ahead like it never happened. Most of the special effects look very fake and cheaply made. They are so fake it ruins the hint of gore I was expecting. The main character actress does a fare job but this about the only redeeming quality in this hole movie.
0, Wrong item: I received the wrong item and can't get a reply back or anything. This has been very frustraiting and a waiste of my time and money.
1, Awesome!: This game is really fun and it works well on my super old PS2. Fast delivery made it more enjoyable.
0, PS2 Madden 2007: I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see. However
0, Another trip to the well.: Waiting in line to buy the new Madden every year is like waiting in line to buy a new calendar. Sure
0, Helping yourself is never easy: The workbook is designed to help you through the Six Steps of Inner Bonding
1, the master grimoire of magickal rites &ceremonies: This book is alive with magickal energies when in my hands book feels alive really produces magick to work with.
0, Poor: I am an avid fan of classic radio
1, Better than other brush-type picks!: These are the best I've used. I have implants and these are very effective in gently removing food particles. The soft textured material is easy on the gums
1, Fantastic Live Performance: Learning to Flinch is a fantastic performance by Warren Zevon back in 1992. I especially love that the liner notes give you not only the words
0, Item shipped was not the item ordered: The item I receved was not the item I ordered. The covers shipped only cover the lower portion of the screen. The item pictured covers the whole screen.Very disappointing...Chris
1, Sailing Through Six Sigma: Everything is first-class in this publication
0, I'd rather have my mind.: This is pretty sickening. The title says it all -- losing your mind
0, Mark Knopler & Dave Edmunds The Booze Brothers by Droop: If you are buying this CD for Knopfler
0, Great idea but not a great product!: Replaced our old tank water heater 2005. We are on our 3rd unit Power Star AE115. The first 2 were covered under warranty but finding someone to replace it was a hassle and each time cost $175 to reinstall. Now #3 has died. I'm done. Back to the old reliable tank water heater. Too bad because I did like the endless supply of hot water. You can not have 2 hot faucets going. So
0, AE125 PowerStar - No Thanks: We are about 7 or 8 months into this water heater and have had it. We have fiddled with the temperature control enough. This weekend I am going to buy a old reliable conventional unit. We haven't had some of the horrendous problems others have reported. I think if I had
1, Bosch AE125: I bought online and installed it myself using compression fittings - very easy to do. Total cost $650
0, Major Need of Product Recall: Heating element is submerged in water 24/7 becoming ionized and shorts the electric circuit. We have had 2 units in less than 25 months. Bosch blames consumer for hardwater and will not honor warranty. This unit should be recalled. This is a very common problem ignored by the company. Avoid this product.
0, Cheaply done and inaccurate: Unfortunately
1, Amazing. For women
0, Terrible at any price: The puzzles are not well thought out and must have been done in a hurry. Every other Hanjie book I have done is far better than this one. It's not even fun.
1, New Battery: I bought this battery for my daughter's laptop as she is back in college. Getting the right battery ordered was easy and the battery arrived timely. Plugged it in and charged it. Working fine. Good price. Satisfied customer.
1, well documented brings Victoria in a different light: Brings Queen Victoria into a very different light 
1, gift: I did not use them
0, Not worth the money!: It didn't provide any more information than the instruction manual that came with the camera did. Only advantage is the size and shape of the book which feels nicer than holding the manual.
0, DO NOT BUY BOSCH PRODUCTS: We purchased a Powerstar AE 115 Electric Tankless Water Heater
1, The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings: This is the greatest CD or album in my opinion that has been recorded. When I was a very young boy I heard the first release and when I heard it I was completely enthralled. I am still enthralled. Dolphy is incredible
1, Zevon is the best: While this is not his best work
1," Transverse City - one of Zevon's best: A terrific record - almost as good as ""Sentimental Hygiene"". On some tracks"
0, The Prince And The Pauper by Mark Twain is a classic novel.: Since the prince and the pauper know nothing of each other's life works
0, A waste of time: This book reputes itself to tell the secret history of British media baron Mr. Maxwell. A better account and although a work of fiction a more plausible account can be found in Mr. Archers `The fourth of Estate'. Maxwell had connections with Israels Mossad and he did have many high level contacts in Israel and he was involved in dubious behavior with the Russians but this book goes one step to far and simply creates relationships that did not exist. Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad. In fact Maxwell simply failed in business and probably committed suicide. This is an interesting account but should be read with an eye of suspicion.
0, Not made very well..: My twins love helping daddy around the house so I thought this would be the perfect toy for them to play with so dad can have his real measuring tape back. The concept is great but the measuring tape is a mess
0, Don't buy this: So annoying ever time my kids pull the tape out they want me to wind it back up. Boring toy
0, Free Advertising: It works
1, Good: The product came on time and it fit what i needed it for. I use my power washer often and i have 1 of the most powerful models you can buy
1, Star Child Enters!: Paul Stanley's first solo release is full of the sond style he would tackle in 80's Kiss.Mature love power ballads and riff-laden rock.Paul had been up to this point the leading songwriter in Kiss;this release had the best song structure out of the four solo albums.However
1, 1/2 of Kiss on one record.: We know the true meaning of Kiss was Paul and Gene
1, extra gentle: I bought this originally for my children to use and I was happy with how it cleaned their faces
1," Just like in the movie!: Excellent size and quality. If your child is a ""Toy Story"" fan"
0, no dice: I was very disappointed in this. For local (Atlantic City) color
1," Remember the 70's?: ""Remember the Titians"" is a realistic feature that triggers a lot of emotions"
0, Could have been better: Don't get me wrong. This is a fine soundtrack. But ANY 60s compilation CD would suffice. Given the rich orchestral themes which were played at length throughout the film it is a pitty that a film score wasn't released in addition to the soundtrack with the 60s songs (as was done for For the Love of the Game).
1, A Question of Priorities: UFO Vol. 1 contains the very best episode of UFO ever
1," If you own a Boxter or dream about owning one read this book: James Morgan nailed the ""Boxter Experience"" on the head. As a Boxter owner"
0, The Worst DVD that I ever bought!: My 14 month old daughter loves animals and we have the entire collection of the babyeinstein series
1, Perfect thickening yet washable mascara: I love this mascara! I have used it for several years and when I try other mascaras
1, Current Obssession: Loudermilk: I have no idea whatsoever how I heard about this band
1, This Rocks!: Killer album. It's hard to tell you what my favorite songs are
1, Best book on hardest thing to do in all of sport.: First read this book when it came out . Totally demystifies process used in hitting a baseball and tilt odds of striking the ball in your favor. Used it to become better hitter. Used it to teach younger sister how to hit(.750 HS avg.)!When hitting you will know what to do rather than simply reacting to whatever is thrown. Should be required reading for all those instructing youthful hitters.
1, Great book: Ted Williams has written the best book on hitting. He stresses the importance of hitting according to your style. The key is getting a good pitch to hit and not making it easier for the pitcher to get you out.
1, Wait until the end.: Well
1, Sleeping Beauty: This is a very good soundtrack! It is one of my very favorites! You feel like you are right in the movie while listening to this.Lady and the Tramp soundtrack is also very good.
0, Lame version of the single!: I was so disappointed when I saw this video
0," Not as great as I thought it would be...: I bought this book after it had been hyped up in ""The Sondheim Review"""
0, A Prosaic Study of a Poetic Composer: Secrest's bio is still unfortunately indispensible for any student of the man behind the musicals
0, Oh
1, Beautiful and mature performances from a gifted prodigy.: The great cellist Rostropovich took a special interest in the exceptionally-gifted young cellist
1," Nice Compilation: A little deeper than a typical ""Greatest Hits"" compilation"
1, Awesome 70's tunes!: Karen Carpenter died way too young. She and Richard made beautiful music together. Great love songs for romantic evenings
1, in love with them again: one of the best albums i got.... and now are streamed on my iphone 5 with amazon cloudand it only costed me 1.99 (when it was on sale)
1, And Then There Was Karen!: There were a lot of voices being heard during the Carpenter's era
1, Uncle Milty Olve Drab Travel Vest: fits well for this heavier female
1, she loved it: I bought this vest for my fiance. She is a photo guru and has been in desperate need for a photographer's vest. She loved it. It provides room for everything she needs and then some. Comfortable
1, Cargo Vest: This is terrific! Just what I was looking for. I had to look up why there's a cotton patch on the pocket (it's for holding fishing lures). The vest fits perfectly and is just what I needed. It will hold everything. I don't need my backpack anymore.
0, So-so singing: Her songs are good but she fails to do them justice. Her voice is so airy and ethereal that it lacks body and she sounds as though she is wailing away. The air plays a large part in her lack of control of her voice. In track 3
1, Great Acoustic Rock!: Love this CD! A friend of mine introduced me to them and I just loved the CD. The harmonies are well worked out and the back and forth playing of the guitars are similar to groups like Guster and Vertical Horizon.
1, Good product: I like the pops not as nice as the drops! They do work
0, Can these guys solo in more then one key? NO!!!!: I opened for these guys in Vegas and let me tell you these guys ARE NOT PLAYING ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES JAZZ!! The band I play with does music ranging from Holdsworth
0, Too many inconceivable coincidences.: The book started off with a bang & Kleenex needed. It then fizzled. There were too many inconceivable coincidences. And how long does it take for 2 people to realize they love each other! Surely their actions could speak louder than words even if they couldn't say them. I mean my gosh how many times did they have to save each other. To me it was ridiculousness & I had difficulty finishing it. Don't waste your time on this. There are too many really good romance novels out there. I have nothing against this author. One of my favorite books was by her
1, good read: This book was worth reading once. It's not the type of book I would read over and over again though.
0, Worst walkthrough I've seen: This is the worst walkthrough I've ever read. The sections are incomplete and misinformed. The book gives the same item multiple names. Information is given twice on the same page and one of those times is always wrong. Weapons are not located correctly
1, All the right stuff: This book is a straight-forward approach to strategy guides! Not a lot of info you don't need
1, Hot Water Quick: Hot water in 2 seconds - oh
1, Very Convenient: Shipping was fast and unit was packaged well. The unit is slightly larger than I expected (2.7 gals) which made for some customizing in the under sink area
1," ONSITE WATER HEATER: Did a good job. For what I bought it for ...a remote sink... it heats enough water to wash your face and hands when needed. Does the job. Its a little larger dimentions than expected. I had just enough room...another 1/4"" or so I wouldn't have been able to fit the space!! Replaced the cord with a different one to reach about another foot of length. Shipping was fast and packing was good no damage. YES I wood recommend. Update: about a year and a half later: Still works great"
1, Bosch GL2.5 gallon POU heater: Worked as advertised. The thing I would like to see built into it is a low water pressure shutoff. This would save the heater in case there was no water in the coil. I had to install an external one. The heater I received had an external temperature control rather than having to take the cover off to adjust it
1, SAVE that H2O!!!: When you have to wait for hot water and it seams like minutes....this point-of-use mini hot water tank is your answer.
0, Disappointing: I have read about Charlotte and Maximillian as peripheral figures in many other books and was looking forward to a book about them alone. Boy
1, History of Radio: Great documentary for anyone interested in history of radio. Was purchased for my father who worked in radio and TV in the early days. Heard it was so good my husband had to get his own copy.
0, Preposterous & Vile: Absurd premise made even worse by repulsive plot. All I can see is a creepy 40 year-old male screen writer who has never had a girlfriend thinking
1, WOAH!: I remember seeing a trailer for this film at the movies awhile ago
0, train runs off it's tracks: Could have been interesting
0, awful and unwatchable nonsense: The equivalent of the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre
1, A triumph of the good villain?: What makes this movie to be a movie as I see
0, Candy don't taste so good anymore...: I can see how feminists would be all over this. 14 year old nymph gets back at an older masochist. Or is it the other way around ? I really wanted to like this film
1, A great controversial movie: I really loved this movie. Its a twist on the normal abductor abductee senario. You're not quite sure what's going on at first who's the bad guy and who's not and as the movie progresses you kind of have to decide for yourself. I thought it was pretty strait forward but I know my brother was pretty pissed about the ending and the main female character. I think this is one that is probably going to piss a lot of guys off and women are going to like. Also you kind of have to pay close attention when they talk because the main point isn't super strait forward and they only mention it like 3 times. In the beginning you see the missing poster briefly
0, Mediocre coverage of a fascinating subject: I found this at a used bookstore and it looked interesting
0, New York Times and Guardian UK
1, A very nice surprise!: This game was a nice surprise. The cut scene movies they had were very cool and the game play was pretty fast paced. From training you guys to throw fire to flying around in a hotair ballon
1, I'm impressed with the results: I met the author in Oregon and spoke to him at length about hypnsis and his weight loss program. He was very helpful and sincere and supportive of my weight loss needs. I have tried many other weight loss hypnsis programs from Amazon and was hesitant about getting another. He gave me the confidence to purchase this tape and it's worked! So far I have lost 17 pounds and I feel better about myself than I have in years. I highly recommend this product and will keep you up to date on how much I ultimately lose.
1, Great for both bath & luggage: I first found this brand/scent at a little shop in the Cincinnati airport. I loved both the body wash and these bath salts so much I tried to ensure any connecting flights I had in the future went through that airport so I could restock. Since the shop didn't have internet or mail order
0, Works well until it fails: I bought the GT-100A door closer along with the open/close status monitor in December of 2009. I installed it myself and everything was great until January 2011 when the door stopped closing automatically. It seems the timer has failed a month after the warranty ran out. Poor quality product in my opinion. The documentation is not very clear on how to troubleshoot this issue so I unplugged power to the garage door closer and started from scratch to confirm that the unit has experienced a failure.
0, Easy to install but unreliable and unpredictable: 10-minute install
1, Works Good: No issues. Installation was easy. Product arrived as described and early than expected. No complaints here. I have installed a K&N in my BMW a couple years ago and these things pay for themselves in the end since they have a lifetime warranty... Good Buy.
0, vERY BIASED IN THEIR VENDORS!!: All vendors in the book pay to be reviewed. Some vendors are not reliable ..do your homework..check out everything before you take their word!!
1, Early Reznor: This album reflects the sound of late 80's music
0," Avoid: To quote Trent Reznor on this reissue ""NIN fans"
1, whoa: wow 
1, ah
0, What's the point!: No bonus tracks
0, I'm not angry
0, Buy the remastered one instead: Pretty Hate machine was a great album
0, Ushering in a new age of banality...: Firstly
0," Ok.. one more time.. this is garbage..: *sigh* I've listened to this again and again.. trying to find how people can like it.. and I can't.. it's horribly awful.. and I have a high tolerance for all music... bleh.. ""Dead Elvis"" is still one of my all-time fav cds out of hundreds.. but this cd is a HUGE disappoinment... Dirge is good.. for 2min.. then you just want it to end.. the songs all lack the nice deep groove the first album had.. this is randomchaos... hard to listen to.. and bad repeating vocals thrown in.. a few songs near the end start to be nice.. but run off and end quick... I bought this cd for $18 the day it was released.. then found it for $3 a few days later used... so now i have 2 poor copies.. (I felt bad for the used one) if you can get this cd for pocket change.. try it.. otherwise.. get Dead Elvis and hunt for better stuff... Death in Vegas has left the building.. d=\"
1, Haunting
0, Disappointing: After receiving our Thomas Ready to Run set which didn't work
0, Had to return: I gave this train to my grandson for Christmas. The wheels-?motor started squealling and stopping on the track shortenly after he started playing with it. I had to return the train and have still
0, Action game - Not strategy: This game reminded me of 'missle command' at an arcade. You don't have to have any strategy
0, a good water saver: My well produces 6 GPM. I have a tankless water heater and I waste water until the hot water arrives. I put the 4 gal. ariston in series with the water heater for the downstairs shower-it works great- instant hot water. I also put a 2 gal. ariston under the kitchen sink. They both save us water. The tankless water heater heats on demand so every time you turn the valve you fire up the water heater. In the kitchen I hooked the ariston to the cold water (it takes too long for hot water) Works fine for me since I do most of the dishes by hand. The fridge has cold water for drinking. These heaters are easy to install so it can be changed in about 5 min. Bill CA.
0, Lousy Support: We installed this unit about 4 years ago
0, Each story seems unfinished: Michael Chabon is a very talented author
1, Creative and exciting short fiction...: When I first came across this book in it's initial paperback printing
1, Absolute best: I have been using this cleanser for years now. I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers. On its own
0, made problems worse: I bought this to clear up some clogged pores on my forehead. I used it every day for 2 months and the problem only seemed to get worse. Once I stopped using this my forehead was cleared up within a week
1," Classic Survival Story: This is a very good book about surviving as a POW in Vietnam. Itdoes get a bit lengthy at time when he is discussing the attemptsto ""correct"" his attitude and he describes the same philosophya few times too many but it is an extremely in depth look atthe philosophical and mental problems faced by a POW in Vietnam."
1, Interesting character interactions: intriguing and confusing: I throughly enjoyed this work of Emily Bronte's (which I believe to be her only novel). I liked Wuthering Heights much more than her sister's
0, This book is painfully boring: If one wants to be bored into tears
0, a pure soap opera: Bronte does no follow up on any characters and leaves us grasping at what the meaning of all the action. For example
0," Wuthering Indeed!: Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid ""classic."" Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that ""wuthering"" is British slang for ""your eyelids are getting heavy"
0, Classic???: I just can't past the boring words to understand the plot. There is this guy who wants to take revenge on everyone
1, Excellent!: Recommended by several friends & was well worth the effort! Found this book to be timeless. Will reread it in the future
1, Good: I never had to read this in high school
1, Wuthering Heights: text
0, I Hated Everyone: All I could think about when reading this novel is what character am I supposed to be interested in. My answer was none of them. I could not stand anyone of the main characters
1, The epitome of love: This is the most devastating
0, A Horrid Disappointment: After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte
0, mixed: i dont know if i would love or hate this book because i couldnt read it because im not the best reader and have to sound things out sometimes and i couldnt understand half the words on the first page alone and so i had to keep looking in the dictionary half the time to under stand and so i gave up and deleted the book but other people tell me its a good book i just coldnt understand it i hope other people like it
1, Couldn't put it down!: This is one of those extremely rare books that it is nearly impossible to put down. For a week
0, Not my favorite: I know many people love this book
1, Classic: This was a classic novel with multiple layers and aspects that keep you interested
0, Dark and dreary: A depressing read about deception in all its forms. Very well written just didn't like the story but at the same time I couldn't put it down because I was hoping for something happy. Weird ending as well.
1, A Love for the Ages.: Who doesn't know a couple like Katherine and Heathcliff? Passionate
0, Product Description Misleading: Though the performances are very good
0, I didn't like this book.: I didn't really like this book
0, not me: I like classics but couldn't get into this one. The style of writing is not my favorite. maybe i'll try again later
1, Chilling: There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews
0, Swollen
1, Wuthering Height's: I enjoyed reading this book
0, Honest opinion of an intelligent
0, It was not the most exciting book I've ever read.: Even though Emily and Charlotte are sisters
1, Incestry: Absolutely loved the approach to this topic. Original
1, The Gothic Bronte: Wuthering Heights is a well-written book. The style and language are impressive. However
0, THIS BOOK WAS SHLOCK!: i hated this book with a passion! i felt no sympathy for any of the characters and i thought that it was pointless and boring.
0, bad paper quality.: I bought this as one of my collection of Classics. Everyone knows that the novel itself deserves a five star. However
0, I didn't like anything about this moisturizer: I purchased this moisturizer at CVS after trying neutrogena Ultra sheer liquid dauly sun protection which
1, Definitely in my top 10: I first saw this movie in the theaters
1, Solid 4.0 for a lighweight film: No wonder Mike is an old
0, Won't Work: The Rocket Rings are designed to fit both 110 & 130 BCD cranks. The crank shipped to me will not work with my (standard) 130 BCD road cranks. Although the holes are in the right place
1, a tender boheme: this is a good version of la boheme. what sets it apart is the tenderness between rodolfo and mimi
1, Awesome: This game brings me back to my high school days. I never had the opportunity to finish the game in high school. Now that I own it
1, GREAT GAME BUT......: This game is AWESOME.Once you get it you can't stop playing it
1, This was and still is top 5 all time: STRAIGHT OUTA COMPTON
0, meh: i thought i would like this album a lot more than i do. reggae and the beatles
0, Menthol Problematic!!!: Product did not work too well for me. Left my face very dry and caused it to peel. I could have lived with it since I use a facial cream after cleansing
1," I Love Mariah Always: Mariah does not absolutely not ""mime"" in this video. It's live at Madison Square Garden for heavens sake. Who will lip synch every single song in front of all those people? I don't think so. Mariah is truly one of the few artist who can sing live. I love you Mariah. *hugz*"
0," Get Real: Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols. I thought how she was doing something that she loved and didn't worry about having to ""lip sync"""
1, Before things went downhill for Mimi.: Fantasy - Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden was her last great concert. After her Daydream album
1, Still a Favorite: I read this book - glued to it - in high school -- and because I am fascinated by medicine anyway
1, NOT very difficult but You must have: The puzzle was a excelente hobie!!! if you are a lord of the ring follower you must have this puzzle
1, K&N intake & filter kit: Product fit good
1, this album rules: I love this album. It is one of the best rap cd
1, Bosch GL6 Point-of-use Mini-Tank Water Heater Electric: I put in a kitchen down stairs because my wife has problems with climbing stairs. I installed this unit under the sink area for use to the Dishwasher and the Sink. Plenty of HOT Water for all the needs. Very easy unit to install. The only problem was the Brass plug that came with the unit
0, Never got to use the product: Received the first product but the round cut outs from the manufacturer were not cut correct to accept the pressure relief valve and the stopper plug. Replaement sent quickly; however
1, Works perfectly!: I bought this water heater to replace a small water heater located in my garage to service my washer. Being able to mount it on the wall was very helpful. It was relatively easy to install and works perfectly with my new high-efficiency washer.
1, High-energy solos
1, Loving it...: This game is perfect for everyone. I think that I have played this game more than any of the other games that I own. It has good graphics
1, Black and Decker Stain Stick - Amazing Results!: For years I have been staining using a regular brush or even a roller with an extension. The results were fine
1, Paint Faster: The paint stick makes painting quicker by saving you the time it normally takes to evenly load a paint roller with paint. Cons: It takes a bit of time to clean the stick; the stick gets a little heavy when loaded with paint (can be solved by filling only half of the stick with paint when starting); and it wasn't long enough for me to paint the ceiling (maybe taller people will have better luck). Still
1, Ready or not
0," Listen to the bad press!: You cannot imagine how BAD this supplement is. In the process of plagarizing alternative ""house rules"
0, Gave up after first 5 minutes: This product works fine for the very first 5 minutes
1, Poulan 400E Electric Chainsaw: The product arrived in perfect working order and ready to use. Very powerful and fast sawing ability for both branches and logs. A friend who has a gas chainsaw said he much preferred using my Poulan electric saw. It is well balanced and easy to use. I do not have a problem with long runs of electrical cord. The longest I have used is 50 feet
1, Poulan Electric Chain Saw: My husband's gas-powered chain saw can be hard to start - especially on cold days. An electric chain saw can be the answer to the problem - as long as the cutting or trimming job isn't too far from home!
1, Terry
0, Do not buy if you have large yard: Purchased saw to trim some medium sized trees. Unfortunately
1, Husband Still Loves It: I purchased this for my husband from Amazon well over 1 year ago. It has had fairly heavy use
1, Worked well for a while....then died....but MY FAULT!!!: Bought this late 2008.....used it about 4 times. Nothing heavy...yard work with no more than an hour of total use. Took it out today to cut a fallen branch
0, Turn the small ding
0, Poor directions: I am a retired ASE Master rated Auto body guy....That said. I'd steer clear of this product. Poor resultsdue to poor instructions in my opinion.Due to past experience I knew what to do to even get passableresults.1. Clean out pit well!!2. Use a non-oil based solvent like 99% Alcohol to pre-cleanglass area.3. Retain a bit of resin for last step. They tell you in one stepto empty it into fitting
0, Not worth even a fraction of the cost: Knowing what is required to repair a windshield
1, Brilliant indeed!: I bought this today and I cannot put into words how incredible this Tosca is! Buy it and be swept away by La Divina!
1, The greatest Tosca ever recorded!: Period. I do not care what a Sills-Fanatic says. I love Nilsson's live Tosca with Carreras
1, what can i say: A spledid tale that I read again and again. One of my absolute favorites and a must read for anyone who read and enjoyed Watership Down (Tailchaser's Song is even better).
1, Very Good Fantasy Tale: This charactors in this book could easily be subsituted for human charactors. If have read Tad Williams Memory Sorrow & Thorn series you will see a lot of similarities. Don't let the cats on the cover scare you away this is just a straight up fantasy story using cats instead of people.
1, Absolute BEST!: I have read a lot of books
0, Disappointing: Tad Williams sets out to a great start
0," Another Stupid cat book.: I guess if you LOVE cats you might find this book tolerable. It is more interested in beating you over the head about how wonderful cats are than telling a meaningful story. An overly obvious take of on Watership Down except it is more interested in promotion of the ""humanity"" of kitty cats than in storytelling.Fritti is one of the shallowist fantasy characters in a long time. Provides a pethetic mouthpiece for the promotion of ""kitty cat philoshpy""AVOID AVOID AVOID"
0, Rust on a new wallet??: Plain and simple
1, Much depends on the instrument: I picked the recording based on the artist
1, The political history of the prohibition movement: In this book
1, Callas-None Better: La Boheme in its complete form is splendid no matter what
0, White bathroom cabinet: I was very disappointed with all of the hardware that came with the cabinet. None of the knobs worked. I Ended up having to go to a hardware store to get new knobs. The screws that hold the hinges were also striped or were not the right size. The doors do not hang correctly. I checked on line and on my receipt to see if there was a customer service phone number. I couldn't find one. I was very disapointed.
1," Excelent Teaching tool: I bought this album for my infant daughter and she has exceled in so many ways. she has show a huge improvement with her attitude and is always asking to listen to ""Tia"". in the car"
0, Hit and (mostly) miss.: After the disappointment of Carol Shields' last book
1," Great book for ages 2-8: This is the ""Old MacDonald"" of books. I would not wait until age 4. Read it to them early and soon they'll read it to you."
1, An excellent description of a seminal event in history.: Well written
0, No Book No Explanation: Placed the order in Nov. but never got the book. After one month
0, Not up to LP standards: This book had a number of problems
1, Elgar ... Cello Concerto + Sea Pictures.: Incredible ... incredible. You get the classic 'Cello Concerto in E minor' of Elgar
1, no need for more versions: I have throughout the years been keeping on buying newer versions of many classical masterpieces
0, Read With Me DVD - too slow to respond: I purchased this for my 5 and 3 yr old daughters - it took some patience to set up
0, It never worked!!: Well I bought this for my nephew and I never could even get it to program. There is a recording that is supposed to guide you at one point but it never came on for me. I followed the instructions and looked at the troubleshooting but still no voice. I am going to contact the company tomorrow.
1, Scanner Rocks: Great scanner. Small footprint. It has jammed a couple of times but resets easily. Easy to use. Scanner rocks.
1, One of the most influential books of the 20th Century: What more can be said about this work which has the distinction of changing the way late 20th Century man thinks? (Well
1, Extraordinary!: Barbara Tuchman has added a perspective that will prove invaluable through time. This is one of the best books I have ever read.Not only is it essential reading if one wants to understand World War I and the geopolitical and military situation that influenced the remainder of the 20th Century; but is also a book that gives extraordinary perspective and life to the individuals who guided and influenced Germany
1, Terrific Military History of the Start of WWI: I picked this book up after having read it decades before. The writing and analysis remains as crisp as when I first read it. I believe the strengths of the book are in the great amount of details provided about the military blunders that occured on both sides during the first month of WWI. Its really an always-topical cautionary tale of how egos
0, Strong anti-German bias: This book has excellent military analysis and I can see why it has many admirers. However
1, a delight in every way: In the Puccini oeuvre Butterfly was not one of my favourite works - until I heard this version. Wow!! Callas is exceptional - drama
0, Once again

1, great size
1, Thumbs up for Mommy's Helper: I was looking for something to keep my little one from sticking things in the electrical outlets. I was pleased to find this cheap package of outlet plugs. They are easy to insert and easy to remove. I will feel confident knowing that my little one won't be able to plug anything into the outlet with these neat little covers on them.
1, Nothing Special!: What can I say...nothing special about these outlet plugs. They are your basic
1, Best out there!: I have tried several that my daughter has easily removed. These are the ONLY ones that she can't remove! I even have a hard time getting these off if I want to use the outlet. Hands down best ones out there!
1, Great product!: I actually bought these to further seal my outlets after adding insulation behind them. These covers are well made and stay in the outlets pretty tight.
0, A Dracula who has dined on more than blood: Count Dracula's diet consisted of blood primarily drawn from the necks of lovely Universal starlets. Lon Chaney
1, Excellent pot!: I've been using Le Creuset for years
1, Surprisingly terrific: I own six books on men's style so far. The only other author to whom I gave 5 stars was Alan Flusser.This book is expertly organized. The information is clear

0, The non - cutting edge .p: Good to look at 
1, Ethical Living: This is a great introduction to ethical living. It is easy to read and very amusing. The information is simple and easy to understand (I think implementing it is the challenge!). If you've read other books on ethical living or magazines such as the ecologist
0, Wish I could give it -10 ( minus 10) No truth in advertising!: if you look at this ..it is 3D and appears to be faceted..be not decieved it is FLAT!This dissapointment would have been enough for me to score this low but the minus numbers arise because of the return policy....you have to jump through hoopes- slalum; climb everest; and oh.... in case you were thinking of sending the item back in a far superior package i.e. bubble envelope- because you threw out the rinky dinkey rubbish cardbord box that it came in... the joke is on you! So dumpster diving time!!!!What a shame! Never AGAIN!!!!
1, Wait a minute....: First.. I totally love this movie. Have for quite a long time.. and have been waiting patiently for it to be released on DVD.... only to discover that upon the release date Feb 21
0, A complete travesty: DO NOT buy this if you are a fan of the original US version released in 1990. The cutting of lines/scenes really retracts from the movie and overall rushes the movie past key character development and plot emphasis. The original was funny
0," Abysmal: What do you call a comedy that has no laughs? ""Erik the Viking"" is the cinematic equivalant of a dead pigeon carcass. They cut 25 minutes from the film's original 104 minute running time to 79 minutes. Reviewers who have seen the original version call this one a butchery. As far as I'm concerned they can expurgate the other 79 minutes. Warts and toe jam have a greater purpose than this flick. Life is precious and I had to waste part of mine on this dross. Shockingly"
0, Four Seasons: My son is 10 months and has been listening/watching Baby Genius since he was 2 months. He loves Mozart and Friends and Sleepytime so we were shocked when he cried when we put in Four Seasons. He will have nothing to do with it; maybe Vivaldi is a little intense for him right now.
1, 3 slabs of freedom: This is a good example in that it's a bit longer than the similarly great SYR1 & more accessable than the way too long SYR4 which was too much for me [I crave weirdness but I haven't 'got' that 1 yet]. This functions as a sort of alternate extended version of side 4 of A THOUSAND LEAVES
1, Back to normal!: After the junk of SYR 1
0, Kong the 8th wonder of the world: Electronic Kong arms: I did not like the service I got when I bougth this product
0, Nothing close to designer style jewelry: I am extremely disappointed by this book
1, Maria Callas - what could possibly be wrong?: This seems to be a good quality recording and an excellent addition to any Opera fan's collection. I looked at the reviews from other people who have this set and was not disappointed in my selection.
0, So So: Sometimes it does' work and you have to reboot.Does not work with firefox.Does not work with anything but Internet Explorer.I like Microsofts a lot better but it wont work with 64 bit.Guess I'm stuck with this generic reader.I wished it work with Microsoft Money.
0, Software upgrades aren't free: This works great. Until a new version of Firefox comes out. Then you need a new Firefox extension to make the fingerprint reader work. Does UPEK provide this for free? Nope: they make you pay. So keep in mind that UPEK treats purchasers of this product as a continuing revenue stream.
1, More Mac Problems: The manufacturer published a new version of the Apple Mac software November 2
1, Easy to use and great security: I purchased the Eikon for my office as we really needed to take security seriously and not make security difficult. Eikon accomplished both. To log in
1, Insightful: I wish I had known this or learned about this in simple terms 24 years ago. This has been a life changing book for me. I hope my wife will read it now.
0, Not really worth it...: These don't really work for us. I don't know if we just aren't using them right. But if we want to wrap the cord up and still be able to pull the shades up or down
0, Falls apart when you touch it.: This is a horrible blind cord winder. I would give it 0 stars if possible. Every time I tried to open the blinds
0, Do I have to give a star..?: These things are complete junk and fall apart whenever you (or your child) touches them...which in turn causes a potential choking hazard for the young child. Save your money.
0, wind up: When I bought the product I was under the impression (mistakenly) that this somehow winds up and down (maybe with a spring or something). The product clears up any tangled cords by storing them in the little white container. However I found the term wind up (assuming it also winds down) misleading. It is almost impossible to 'wind down' or for that matter wind up without opening it and redoing the winding. As mentioned it does an ample job of getting some of the long cords out of the way.
0, I Beg Your Pardon: I am one of the contributors to this volume. I agree with Mr. Scott about the excellence of Mr. Krick's essay. Of course
1, Highest recommendation I can make!: I have became the biggest fan of Joan Sutherland lately
1, A good recording
1, Mozart vision of Donna Anna: Sutherland at the very peak of her incredible powers as Donna Anna has to be heard to believe. A true dramatic coloratura soprano with the most clear beautiful tone I've ever heard. The conducting is perfect. And the rest of the cast is ideal.
1, Everything You Ever Wanted to Know. . .: about soft furnishings for doll houses. I ordered four books on this subject and returned three because this one covered everything. It's the only one you'll need. Drapes and curtains
0," Decent enough... but SPOILERS: Does just about every romance have to judge the heroine on whether or not she wants kids? Really? Can we have a book in which the heroine doesn't want children and not have it be some sort of MORAL test or a crippling fear. (""Poor girl"
1, movie: i chose this rating cause i love this movie
1, Been looking for it: been wating forever for this movie to come out. This movie is what made me want to become a movie director.
1, Good reading: Although the movie was campy
0, Callas
0, Cat Toy: As excited as I was after reading other reviews
1, A wonderful book with a lesson!: All children should read this book to learn to be contented and grateful for what they have and not to believe that the grass is always greener on the other side. Simple but meaningful
0, Down For The Count: I didn't like this book. The art is ugly
1," Useful: Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes (cpe) has the gift of story-telling and this wise tale is about the cycles of life. For anybody that has ever ""burned it to the ground"" and found themselves waiting for the new green blades of grass to come again. Carve out a place for new growth in your life."
1, Cleaner Track list: I am just adding a track list that is easier to read:1. 3:56 (Can't Live Without Your) Love And Affection2. 4:23 I Can Hardly Wait3. 4:05 After The Rain4. 5:21 Tracy's Song & Only Time Will Tell5. 3:30 More Than Ever6. 4:27 (It's Just) Desire7. 4:41 Fill You Up8. 6:37 Interlude & Everywhere I Go9. 4:06 Bits And Pieces10. 4:20 Will You Love Me?
0, Uuhhh....: This Cd came into my way accidentally in a friend's house. It's glam in its worse performance
0," What NOT to read when you can't get pregnant: Suffering from the inability to get pregnant is a difficult and arduous journey. Reading this book was worse. Shame on Daniel Potter for trying to pass this off as helpful.Clearly all of your friends have written the good reviews. My advise to others is to look for books like "" A FEW GOOD EGGS"" ( Two chicks dish on overcoming the insanity of infertility) Now those women know how to be helpful!!!!!!"
0, Do not purchase this item unless it's for a 7 year-old: The sizing is described incorrectly. A XL = a 6 in girl sizes.Also
0, Never buy from Horizon Fitness!: I bought a Horizon CST3.5 Treadmill in 2006. Now it's broken. Horizon Fitness contracted his customer support to another company. That company charged me $99 upfront just for someone coming to my house to look at it. Then the guy who should come gave such hard time to make an appointment. He almost want to come to my house next year. I spent more than half hour for just set up an appointment with him. My money is already gone. Otherwise
1, Love it!: I just can't recommend the Firm enough to people! As a long-time avid follower of the Firm
1, A Cute Movie: I got this movie because Jamie Kennedy was in it and he didn't disappoint me. He gave a really good performance
1, The ultamite monster clash: Ive written many monster stuff on this site this my first video game review this was one of the best video game i have ever played 3 of the monsters are simaler to movie monsters buy this!
1, It works!!!: I was very skeptical that this would work
1, Fantastic product: For some reason
0, The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society: The book open my eyes more about this great organzation
0, Doesn't work well with XP: Initially it works well with XP until about the 3rd consecutive scan. After that is jams the scan cue and eventually will hang.My advice is to save your money if you have XP. Get a Hewlett Packard printer
0, Disturbing and Difficult Read...: I was a dedicated fan of Celine Dion before I read this book. Although I will always remain a fan of her music
1, Celine Dion My Story
0, Picture more elegant than product.: Picture has a much better presentation than the actual product. See it first before buying the watch. Hope it helps
0, JOIN THE 1-STAR CROWD: Same problem as the other 1-star reviewers - bought the 32XBR4 two years ago
0, Faulty Panel Assembly: I had this TV for 1 year and 10 months with no problems until a few days ago. My 32 inch XBR4 now is unviewable with colored vertical lines across the entire screen. I only used this TV about 4 to 5 hours a week at the most. I've done some research online and found that this is a fairly common problem with the Sony lcd sets sold in the latter half of 2007
1, Man
0, Sent wrong book twice
0, musical emperor's new clothes: This is musical emperor's new clothes. Nice and streamlined playing has really nothing to do with great performance. I would much prefer listening to Vladimir Horowitz' last recording (1978) of the d-minor concerto. His playing is so full of drama and colors
1, indoor digital antenna: Purchased this product b/c of online reviews. Unit worked great until Christmas Day. As I adjusted antenna
0, It's good---NOT: This game has some of the worst graphics I have ever seen. There is NO plot
0, The quality of the songs is excellent...but a waste of money if you already have the collection of CD's: Look....dont be just another fool parted with their hard earned money.....if you already have the cd's....of all the music THE BEATLES released.....you're either a chump...or your bankroll exceeds your common sense....I love THE BEATLES...but am sick of all the same material being duplicated to death....just anoth marketing hoax to keep the bucks flowing in
0, Not Worth It for Me: I picked this book up on sale
0, You can get these performances minus the applause: To the best of my knowledge
1, If we could be with you one hour tonight 
1, Krait is Great!: I bought BOTH the Krait and the Deathadder and have used both for several weeks. I like the Krait better because it is lighter
1, Ok for lower elementary: My husband and I have been on the quest to find junior encyclopedias for our kids. We have K-4 in the house
0, slow uninteresting read: I started this book on a long international flight and it was the only book I took with me or I'd have tossed it after 50 pages. It was difficult to read because the words didn't flow. A few times I couldn't even figure out what they were trying to say and had to reread a paragraph because of either typos or strange word choices. Around page 350 it finally caught my interest and the last 100 pages had some surprises and movement. But overall
0, bad Spanish translation: I like the story in English
0, It just doesn't work: The recipes have severe errors that make the instructions confusing or utterly impossible. I just had to throw out yet another batch of cookie dough after following a recipe from this book. I have now tried seven different recipes from the book
0, There are better books....: When I first purchase this book I was so excited tot ry many of the different recipes... but like many others I found them lacking. They never seemed to turn out like the ones displayed in the book
0, His recipes just don't work: This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work. I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out. I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart
1, A great book if you want to try something new: If you are looking for some different cookie recipes
1, Perfect Solution: High quality product. Thick plastic. Baby cannot slide the plastic cover over
0, basically unusable: I wanted to love these outlet covers
0, Great idea
0," Interesting Account of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: I like Justin Green's stuff. ""Binky Brown Makes Up His Own Puberty Rites"" is an excellent example of adolescent anguish. Also"
1, puts the lessons of joyce into a modern context: Call It Sleep
0, Not the book I expected.: I had high hopes for this book when I saw the writeup on Amazon. And was I disappointed. Gotta agree with the person who says this is opportunistic. It's basically a rehash of a dozen POTWs (Patient of the Week) and nothing new.If you want a better feel for how Dr. House might do it
0, I bought this not as a toy: I used this product for 20 minutes
0, Oh the HORROR: I had this book crammed down my throat when I was a sophomore in high school. It was by far my worst experience as a student - the material was far too abstract for that period of my development
0, great movie - tape quality abysmally bad: The people selling this VHS tape should be prosecuted for fraud. We could barely hear the dialogue due to a constant
1, A W E S O M E ! ! ! !: You have got to choose this phone - I have had it for two years
1, I'm glad I wasn't persuaded by the negative reviews.: I almost didn't buy this phone because of the negative reviews posted here. It sounded like there were too many problems with this model. My previous experiences with VTech were good
1, good for storytime: I agree with the other positive reviews. I just wanted to add that I used this book with a preschool storytime
1, Cute Book for Kids...: My daughter loves to look at pictures of babies so she absolutely loved this book. The pictures are really cute and go with a color. Great introduction to colors for kids.
1," The real Bounty Killer album: The Mystery speaks to the difference between Bounty Killer and most of his dancehall peers. His ability to perform on slower reggae rhtyhms has been a signature of his work from earlier tracks such as ""Seek God"""
0, DISAPPOINTING: I am very familiar with all these songs
1, A moving portrait of a remarkable man.: Elie Wiesel's life is a miracle. He not only survived the death camps as a child
1, Fine
1, With this album The Ox proved he could stand on his own.: What a great CD. Pete Townshend could not have written such hard rocking songs that have such a weird since of humor. You can not go wrong with this. It is made even better by the inclusion of Entwistle's remake of Neil Young's Cinnamon Girl. THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1, Julia Navarro rocks: This is a very well written book. It has all the elements to keep you interested from the first to the last page. The final it's very well articulated. In the line of Da Vinci Code this book is maybe even better. Navarro is a great writer and I hope to read more from her. Congratulations!. Highly recomendable.
0, Poor recording that never should have been made: Callas
1, Truly a Sample of the Best: Sizzla has too many good songs to fit all of his best songs on a double cd
0, THIS BOOK IS USELESS
1, A Real Eye-Opener into doctor manipulation of birth process: I highly recommend this book to any woman preparing to give birth in a hospital. RUN
0, OS tgermometer: Would not recommend this produst . Could not get the outdoor remote to broadcast (connect) to the main unit. OS recommends lithium batteries ( $2 + each)that would be an expensive temp reading.
0, Poor quality...: I did all the steps as described and I don't even live in a harsh environment.... Broke again after 4 months. Poor choice on my part.
1, Works like it says. Tried before and liked it.: I have used this product (or similar product) before on a 1970's VW bug and it worked. It was for my rear defroster. I needed to fix my Subaru with the in-glass antenna and decided to give it a try. It works great and improved my radio reception phenomenally. The antenna had a few broken lines. It won't make it look like original or new
0, No product-no sevice: Simple...Ordered and paid for the CD. CD did not turn up. Got my money back from Amazon. Company did not fufill our sales agreement. Don't buy from this company!
0, This is not a mount kit: This product (SM5346) is a steel mount with no rubber bushings
1, Highway to Heaven-Season 2: I enjoyed this Season also
0, The Angel Returns: This film had a good plot
0, Worst DVD transfer in my collection: First let me say that this 1-star rating is only for the DVD transfer quality----it's just terrible; everything else about the movie (story line
1, A chilling film
0, Poorly constructed chest expander: The rubber tube is easily untouched from the fixture when you pull. This is because the ball inside both ends of the rubber tube is squeezed out of the tube.
1, great for it's price!: This bedding set is great.Honestly i thought that it was going to be bad quality because of the price but its really good quality
1, Dope.: It was real nice to see this nicely made film in the comfort of my own home and not in the basement of my crazy aunt's house on an old betamax player and black and white tv.
0, Not a great choice...: I found the book to be rather difficult to use. I felt that much more of the book could have been devoted to personality tests and relating them to your career. The tests that are included in the book are often shortened versions of what is available on the internet. If you are not very good at evaluating yourself this may be helpful
0, not as good as GTA 3 
1, Rarely does this happen!: Rarely does a hugely epic rock band like Genesis have there lead singer quit
0, Great album ruined by poor transfer: I loved this album when it came out on LP in 1976. I owned an import copy on the Charisma label
1, i didn't know how good post gabriel stuff was!: talk to nearly anyone that's into early genesis and they'll tell you the The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is the last good thing that they put out. however
1," All Your Worth by Tyagi et al.: This is a good book for providing a disciplined approach towardsaving for the future. The authors ask that we monitor net worthcarefully and discriminate between the ""must haves"" versus thosethings that are extravagant or ""nice to have"". Survival over thelong term is the key. Managing credit card debt is acondition precedent to savings. The authors warn against emotional spending "
1, Guilty Pleasure: J-Dramas are my guilty pleasure
1, This movie is intense
0, Come on now: Did I watch the same movie the other reviews watched? The acting was par
0, Gore: Apparently Clyde Phillips thinks gore is more important than good writing. I don't see how anyone would want to waste their time reading a book that starts out with someone getting their eyes gouged out with a spoon.
1, A great way to eat!: I've been hearing for years that I should eat more pulses and legumes
1, even better than I remembered: I hadn't heard this record in about 15 years when I recently picked up the CD (Captain Oi version). What a great record! Total punk rock but with real R&R; roots. The band is so tight
1, Absolut SkaRaiRapFunkRockSoul!: Had the great fortune to see them live in Montreal this summer uring the jazz fest. Live
1, This was a pretty good movie: College student Jake Lo (Brandon Lee) stars in this good movie. He was a average college student until he became a important witness. The FBI has him under protection.This movie is awesome if you like martial arts and action. It is worth seeing.
0, not what I expected: These light bulbs came quickly and I was happy to put them in
1, Shakespeare meets Pulp Fiction: This is a really great interpretation of one of William Shakespear's most famous works. Set in current times it works better than you would think. The direction
1, A Colorful Interpretation of the Classic Text: Let me start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It's one of those movies that should be approached with an open mind
1, This is the best movie ever !!!!!: I loved this movie so much !! I watch it at least once a week. Leo is such a good actor ! He is so incredibly HOTT !!! This movie made me understand Shakespeare so much better ! And it also made me get into it more when you watch the movie and not just read it from the book ! Leo made the whole movie Awesome though ! ! I LOVE LEO !! END
0, Disgusting: Disliked:Tybalt pointing gun in the face of a childObscene gesturesGlamorized gun violenceRomeo taking drug Mercutio offered himJuliet shooting herself in the headGlamorized teen suicide
0, Laughably bad: I have nothing against modern adaptations of classics
1, One of The Best Movies Ever!: Romeo and Juliet
0, romeo and juliet: I heard it was a great movie from a friend so i bought it. didn't like the way they spoke in the movie old english
0, You cannot be serious!: This is absoloutely dire. I've tried several times but can't get past the first 3 scenes. I'm glad I read the play before watching this or I would have been put off forever. To say it's a modern adaptation doesn't really describe it - it's more like a pantomime version with Montagues and Capulets not just as rival gangs but as owners of the town
0, Leonardo SUCKS!: the whole film is absolutely ruined by the actors who can't act at all. It's a nice try of Luhrmann to combine the postmodern scenario with the Elizabethan language
0, the gay romeo and juliet = a waste of time by !idee: reviewDuring the past week I saw the movie
0, Huge Let Down: This rendition of Shakespear's masterpiece is a bitter failure. The dialogue was awkwardly American. De Caprio has no business as Romeo. He has the look but not the artistic elegance. Danes is simply not attractive
0, Flashy 
0, crummy quailty: I love this movie and was eagerly antcapting buying this so when I saw a large department store had it on sale at a good price i bought it. I got home only to discover the disc very scratched and the movie not playable without skips every few seconds. I took it back and tried to get another one and opened it in front of the clerk only to find another one in the same condtion. Fox please make your discs better
1, Slipping-A Wild Ride!: Dean Koontz fans-check this out! Barri Bumgarner has created characters you can relate to
1, PS2 Glow Controller: I bought this for my daughter to use with her PS2-she loves it!She likes the color and the glowing light.It was brand new
0, Very bad indeed!: this movie is not a good movie! Lifetime may
0, Rather dissapointing.: Well I'd lie if I said other-wise. I like almost all of the Val Kilmer movies except this one. It sort of dragged
0, Second worst movie I ever saw!: It goes on and on and on. First he has an idiotic smile on his face so we'll know how happy and well adjusted he is. Then this film slips into soft-core porn. The pacing is off by about two-thirds (WAY too slow to hold my interest) and then they bring in a so-called therapist who is insulting and completely inappropriate and keeps saying
0, one of the worst movie ever made: this film was an absolute complete waste of my time. Val Kilmer acted out pure disrespect for the blind. there was no research into how a blind man would act given the circumstances. the story line of the film was a complete disaster and so was the romance (if there was any.)
1, Nice Slides From Amazon: I'll start out by saying that I've read a lot of reviews on these slides. Everybody complaining about the packaging! I think the packaging is just fine! I bought the slides not the way their packaged. The slides are high quality and very nice to use. I'm satisfied and think their a quality product!!
1, Great deal!: These slides were exactly what I wanted
0, Hearth & Garden Standard Round Table Cover: Totally unacceptable product. The elastic band used to keep the cover in place became non-elastic in less than 2 months. Now the cover can be blown off by light breezes making it totally useless for the purpose intended. A waste of money.
1," ""Pictures"" redefined.: For me"
1, Pictures Good; Romeo Is So Slow
1, Berlioz!: Oh Ms. Smithson
1," Better than that ""biggest loser chick"": Im selling most of my other workouts!I swear!Jari`s workouts are all you need.I recently purchased Ripped 1000 and liked it so much that I bought this one.I`ll be using them both weekly.I was`nt this sore doing P90X.I feel confident that these dvd`s will help me reach that ripped look that I`ve been trying so hard to get."
1, Amazing price and phenomenal cutting: For the price and the amount of scissors you get this is a no brainer. The quality is exceptional and the grip is comfortable for most of the scissors. The one's that fit my hands worst was the 2nd to smallest. The rest of them were fine
0," A ""Best Of"" No-No: Consolidating the accomplishments of one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history onto one CD is criminal. Rhino Records does a great job with their ""Complete Greatest Hits"
1, Fine performance: Sir Colin Davis plays it pretty straightforward here and there's nothing wrong with that. Complaining that this doesn't compare to Dohnanyi
1, All in all a good read.: The main problem I had with this book is Julie. She was definitely not the sharpest tack in the box if after 8 years of marriage she hadn't figured out what hubby was like! She was also way too obsessed with her appearance.I loved Mac & the scenes of him in drag were a scream!
1, GREAT STORY: This audio cassette was wonderful. The story was very good and the interaction between the characters was so funny that I found myself laughing alone. Try it
1, Just a excellent movie: This movie had to be the best love story I have seen in a long time. Its not so much a love story though
0, Dreadful: The only reason to see this movie is to admire Catherine Zeta-Jones' immense talent
0, Bad movie
0, Watch It Only For Connery: Entrapment is too mediocre to be enjoyed. Connery is it's only saving grace. The plot is weak
1, Guess who?: Easy to read. How do you guess who the right person is in this story? I kept changing my mind.
0, It dragggggged: This could have been interesting
0, What was I thinking??: I picked this up because it was suggested to me from Amazon. I do not know why. This is not at all my type of book. I like a romance the caliber of Nicholas Sparks ok
0, Geeeez...can't make myself finish it!: I read all kinds of things - and read a lot. This is one of the few books I'm not even going to finish. The editing errors
0, Bad characterization and very stilted dialog: This is the first book I am reading of this author. The writing felt very amateurish and I really cant believe that this book has such high ratings here. I wish I could get my money back!
1, Excellent book with lots of methods: This is an excellent numerical methods book 
1, The real deal!: This tape is not only a must for all students of Shorin Ryu Seibukan
0, Don't Buy This Book!: This book is lacking in substance. The text only contains 14 pages of information -all of it so superficial that it is of no substantive value. The remaining 60 pages consist of 3 appendices that are nothing more than sample condominium declarations
0, phlegmatic and didactic: I'm a big fan of Celibidache's live recordings from the 1960's with the Italian orchestras from rome and milan
0, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PERSON!!!: I was very disappointed when I went to play this DVD and realized it was a bootleg. The quality is horrible and the picture size of the film only shows up as a 12 by 12 square on your screen. Not quite sure how people get away selling these
0, Lousy rip-off of the first.: Save your money. But if you do want to see it
1, Hi: Greatest book ever I loved it!!!!!!!!!!! READ THIS BOOK OR ELSE!!!!!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing so awesome and cool and wonderful
1, Awesome book: This book was awesome and I wonder if max and fang will go out in the next book!!!!!!! ! So excited to find out!!!!!!!!!!!!
1," Angel: Several people have written that they feel the book is unfinished. It is the third in the line of books about Max and the other flying ""kids"". The first one is called: ""When the wind blows"" and the second is called ""The lake house"". Read them they are good...... And there might be more to come!"
1, Really Good Book!: Loved this Book I'm a first time reader of James Patterson and i absolutely love this book I will get the second!
0, Not a whole book: The book bounces around terribly at times. I understand following characters as they split up
1, Loved it!!: First of all I'm a Sunday at Tiffany's
0, Disappointed: I was very disappointed in this product. I was looking for a CD version of Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment to use in my classroom. Unfortunately
0," Simplistic and completely predictable: Though I enjoyed ""When the Wind Blows"""
0, Disappointment: Patterson fans expecting his usual enthralling work will be disappointed. This is NOT a sequel to The Lake House. Max in this book is not Max from the other bird children books. If you think you're going to read about Max and her babies
0, Absolutly insulting...: After a yaer of many different friends saying that I should read this book
0, Save your money for something else: This book is one of the worst I have ever read. Although it seems well structured and covers many materials
1, my grand son favorite movie: I brought this for my grandson
0, cheaper: you can find them at autozone for $8 each. its too expensive here. qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq
1, A must-have for Titans fans: What can I say? Lots of Pérez art
0, Not so good.........: If you have nothing better to watch then you might be able to justify your time spent on this one. Both main actors are rather young and haven't fully developed their acting skills at this point. Actually
1, worth waiting for....: I was looking for inexpensive patio chair covers that were a nuetral color and not made of cheap vinyl
0," ""Cue the Short Gangster!"": It's important in watching this movie to ignore the fact that Danny DiVito plays a gangster. ...Any gangster"

1, Rock for the new millenium: A stunning release by America's greatest undiscovered songwriter (remember Barbara Keith? she's back) and her primal rock trio. This band defines American rock for the new millenuim . These are songs that are rooted in the rock-country-punk tradition
0, h7605 chuck: Money would be better spent on a chuck with full grip jaws. This chuck threw ever piece I put in it. It was a hazard on my lathe. I have disposed of it
0, High Entertainment Value: I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact
1, An absolute must for doing business in Asia: I lived and worked in Asia for over 8 years. Fortunately
1, Tracey Thorn: This is Tracy Thorns best production yet
1," Sublime: This one took me several listens over a long period to appreciate. But patience paid off and I find it to be a very well crafted record with just the right amount of mix of brooding and sparkle. Tracy has one of the warmest voices in pop music and she hits her mark on ""Out of the Woods"". If you are a fan of EBTG"
0, Very Underated
1, Best Ever: Castle Endura is the best automotive lubricant ever created by mankind. I am not kidding. It sprays on as a liquid and and solidifies into something the consistency chicken grease after 15 minutes or so. It wicks around surfaces to places that are had to reach
1, Magnetic Board Review: This is an excellent educational tool for teaching you little one letters and spelling. The edge of this board and the letters are made of wood and the letters are painted with bright colors. But I have 2 problems with this toy. First of all
1, Fascinating story: This story is absolutely captivating. The author is a man who is unable to communicate except for his ability to blink one eye. The entire book was dictated in this manner after having suffered a stroke. I read this book from the mindset of a health professional and I found it to be very helpful for empathizing with the patient. It is important to remember that just because a patient cannot speak
1, Slip of a memoir: Gorgeously written
1, A terrifically well-scored movie: I loved this movie from the opening scenes all the way to the closing credits. Although I'm a big fan of both Williams and Cusack
0, AVOID at all costs: I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and really regretted it. I wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back. Even Robin Williams couldn't save this dog of a movie. I sat there thinking
1, great book: This book is a must read for anyone wants to understand the history of independent living and the Disability Rights Movement! Well worth the read.
0, Very short life: I bought this phone about a year ago and it was fine for the first six months. It has been dying in the middle of calls lately and it finally just died for good the other day. It is not the battery - I replaced it. It is just a low quality phone.
0, This is not Country Music's 500 greatest!: If you want to include the following records in a list of Country Music's 500 greatest singles:Atlantic city by Bruce SpringsteenHonky Tonk Women by the Rolling StonesQueen of Hearts by Juice Newtonand various other songs listed by Bing Crosby
0, Where's the movie?: You want a good tone-poem
1, great buy: The colors i got were not bad at all. I got a blue print that isn't too ostentatious. The top is a little too big for me and the bottoms are a little too high cut for my taste
0, wallstreet: This movie was not very good. The movie was slow
0, God-Awful: Utterly
0, surprised: I have to say that I was a bit surprised at the content of this movie. It should be sold as a porn product!
0, Just Waking Up: I should have listened to the other reviews
1, 66703 Airbed: I was very plased with this inflatable bed. It was easy to inflate anddeflate. The sheets I had on hand fit perfectly.
0, Why so expensive??: Why is this movie soo expensive? It is a very good movie but NO movie is worth $96.00!Is this a misprint?
1, folks with tom selleck: this is one of the funniest movies ever. i laughed hysterically through the whole thing. the worst things got for the main character (tom selleck)
1, Amazon and Grandma Save Christmas . . .: . . . for one very happy 6-yr. old grandson. I really did search everywhere for this X-box version -- not the 360 one -- of the Stars Wars II: The Original Trilogy. As it turned out
0, vhs used people: i already have done this but here i go againthe item i purchased said it was in excellent condition and therefore i paid more thanother selectionsthe item was received but the audio was horrible i have purchased many items from Amazon and havebeen very satisfied this was the first one that i was not - very disappointed with Amazon not taking ownershipand fixing the problem still to this date have not heard from the subsender regarding the problemwhat do i do now
0, Science Fiction Sex: Star Quest II didn't have much of a good dialogue or plot
0, be warned: The pen went together fine with a little assistance and looks nice. HOWEVER
0, One Man's Justice: A good looking film
0, Okay CD but not as good as I'd expected: I had heard so much hype about Fantasia that I expected her CD to be better than this. Contrary to reports she is not and never will be another Whitney Houston.
0, Dreadful: Just dreadful. didn't even make it home and I was dissapointed. I ended up playing my Clay CD instead.
0, Fantasia Burrino: I can't believe that anybody would think her voice is good. I think she needs voice lessons
0, PURE
0, Well.......: All i have to say is...Fantasia first single is summertime and diana's single dont cry out loud is completly destroying fantasia's single in the charts...Fantasia's next single is chain of fools....Diana's is dreams...looks like 2 of 3 diana's singles r gonna beat fantasia's
0, Different: I can't say I liked this at all. The songs all have the same sound although different titles. I was disapointed. Maybe the next run for hew will be better.
0, Enough already!: Another season
0, Bland and boring: This single has 3 songs. The first
0," Try Again: This machine keeps trying to pop out pop stars and is really failing miserably. First you have the Yelly Clarkson who turns every word into five. Then you have Ruben Snoredard. He's not street and he unsuccessfully tried to put hip hop elements in his ""muzak"" and that is totally ridiculous and laughable. Although Clay Aiken comes close to being the better of the three"
0, Don't like her!: I do not like Fantasia at all! Diana is such a better singer! Fantasia sounds like Mickey/Minnie Mouse! Her I believe is so horrible
0, ugh...: something is seriously wrong here. Fantasia Barrino has tallent
0, Wow: Right when I listened to her I believe song I though of a cat getting sucked up by a vacuum cleaner
0, GROSSLY OVERRATED...: I'm sorry
1, A music fan from Long Island NY: A Fantastic CD..... Fantasia put her heart and soul into this CD and it has all paid off. Listening to her sing brought tears to my eyes and proved to me that great things will come in the future from Miss Fantasia
1, AW GIRL~I can't get enough of you!!!!!: I have missed hearing her sing live since the ending of American Idol so much.It was the first season of it that I watched since Im not into generic commercialized music.But fantasia-Oh my God-Fantasia is a devastatingly talented young woman.Her voice transcends time.She could sing a country song
0, diana may have screamed on part of a song but...: fantasia
1, A True Talent In The Making: After winning American Idol in 2004
1," Simply AMAZING!!!!: I am not kidding - I rec'd this CD today and haven't stop listening to it! It has been over 5 hours and I having it on continuous play and still enjoying it.I can not believe how well this turn out (or should I say YES I CAN) - Fantasia is absolutely GREAT! Phenomenal is a better word - ""I Believe"" is just touching and makes you want to cry. ""Summetime"" is bluesy and just enjoyable. ""Chain of Fools"" is also off the chain! You go Fantasia! See will definitely be apart of my collection!"
0, Not Worth The Money: I am an Idol fan so I thought that I would give this cd a chance since they usually produce good music
0, I find her voice annoying: I found her voice annoying on American Idol and I find her voice annoying on this (I listened to it in a friends car). Her voice would get so annoying after only a couple of minutes if you hadn't enjoyed her on American Idol and already formed an opinion of her.
0, awfully bad!: There is no suspense
1, Ehhh: Oldie but goodie. Very interesting movie plot doesn't come up too often. Nothing like seeing actors that are awesome now starting up. Don cheadle was great in this!
0, Tommy Lee's had better: These 2 movies came out within months of each other and after watching Dante's Peak and I couldn't help but feeling disappointed by this one. Although it does have some great visual effects I couldn't get past all of the yelling. All I can say is did they have to kill the dog couldn't they have left that part out?
1, Better sound quality...: We bought this phone after my wife insisted that our standard Uniden 900 Mhz sound quality wasn't good enough
0, An OK phone... but
0, Just plain terrible: After listening to the tracks online
0, terrible.: most of the songs are pretty bad
0, THE WORST!: Dont spend your money on this! The whole CD is horrible! Jessica has gone wayyy down hill with her music.
0, Always a Fan...But NOT impressed this time!: I could do without this new CD. I just dont like this new style she is trying to go with. This album is nothing compared to Nick's. I wouldnt waste your money unfortunately on this one.
0," ""And the Band Played On"" should be pulled from the shelves...: This is a horrible CD; most of the songs are extremely cliche and breathily sang. It seems that Jessica Simpson just can't evolve and grow as an artist. Instead"
0, This CD is disappointing: In my opinion
0, Jessica try again!!!: it is time for Jessica to sing songs that fits a woman. This bubblegum type of music is just horrendous. The lyrics are the ones of a teenage girl. Sorry but this cd is a big disapointment. If you want something meaningful
0, Want to laugh...then listen to this album: A hysterical attempt at a publicity rushed album that is a total joke. Don't waste your money....wait for a few weeks
1, exquisite
1, Fast shipping
0, Product didn't work: This is one of my favorite movies
1, great: I seen this Movie when it first came out and its one of the few movies I dont mind watching again.
0, factory seconds/tastes great though!: These suckers taste GREAT... but after opening the wrappers
0, SPEED 2: LACK OF CONTROL !: Guy
0, Stupid in a funny way ? No: This movie is so awful
0, BAD: I loved the first Speed. I gave Speed ****1/2. But then I rented Speed 2 and I was so disappointed. I love Sandra Bullock espesially in the character of Angela Benett. The Angela in the first Speed. The character plain leads to a whiny know-it-all character. Sandra dows the best she can but the character will be never more. Also
0, this is exactly what is wrong with hollywood today!!: As a fan of the original
0, One of the worst movies ever!: Why
1, Not that bad as they all say: I found that this movie was not as bas as you read all the time. All right
0, Speed 2 -Cruise Control: Definitely avoidable. Sheer waste of time. The acting is very average and tze storytelling is very weak. Even Sandra Bullock has given an oridinary performance.If you want waste money
1, Impressive!: This movie
0, Dead on Arrival: This is the second time I've had a Uniden phone. The first one lasted just a few months. I should have known better; this one was dead on arrival. After charging for 24 hours
1, Brilliant!: This is one of my favourite movies. Like other reviewers
1, The haunting sound track 
1, Classic Movie: Clearly we are not here to provide an opinion/review of the movie Miller's Crossing (although it is one of my favorites and I believe everyone should see it). The blu-ray format for this movie was on par with the rest of the transitions. Unfortunately
0, What a dissapointment: I bought this DVD based on the recommendations in Amazon and the actors - I typically enjoy Gabriel Byrne films (Defence of the Realm is superb) and Albert Finney is a favourite.I watched the film and fell asleep (admittedly I was tired). The next evening I took another look. What a dissapointment. Quite simply this film didn't do it. Byrne was totally emotionless - took some severe beatings without so much a showing a scratch. Predictable film. Just lacking. Period.One to rent from Blockbuster
0, Okay
1, The title song is the best: I bought this cd because when I heard the title song in a new age bookshop
0, An assault on nature: I know virtually nothing about Sarah Brightman and have only heard one track on this record. That listening has left me so apopletic
1, Enchanting!: I'm not exactly sure why the opera purists are in a fit over this CD. Brightman herself never referred to this work as an entirely operatic piece
0, Pop music lovers STAY AWAY!: I have one word for you OPERA
1, Simply the converter: Before this cd was recomended to me
1, Time to say goodbye: I love every song on this CD
1, How to shake depresion: I have a bit of sadness in me at times. While driving home tonight to my shangrila in the Wyoming mountains (a 35 mile drive) I inserted this disk in my receiver and listened to Sarah's beautiful voice (and Bocheli's pretty good too). By the time I got home
1, I never get tired of Sara!: This is one of my favorite CD'S Sara Brightman. Her voice soars! It remains one that is played over and over again.
1, Hour of the gate: I previously purchased this item from another bookstore as paper back when the book was originally written. I love this particular series by Foster more than any of the other series is written since. The spell singer series is a strange combination of fantasy and science and has always fascinated me. It's been over 40 years since the first novel was written in this series and it spells still grabs me in.
1," Powerful. Works great: I purchased this dremel to widen my iphone dock so that it would fit the iphone 3GS. I know what you're thinking- just get a new dock. I am tired of being raped by apple so I saw this on YouTube and figured ""Why not give it a shot"". The dremel was able to shave the dock easily and with minimal effort. I was surprised how precise this instrument is. Once the grinded areas was sanded you could hardly tell there was any work done at all. For about ten dollars more than the dock cost"
0, Not my favorite in the series: As with the previous book I found this one very hard to get into. I guess as Betsy got older she lost a lot of her appeal for me. While I cherish the ones when they were in their elementary years. I found this one a real bore. It took me a week to get through it and that was forcing myself.The character Betsy for me was kind of silly. I could not relate to her. I understand she took the trip to get over losing Joe but she could never really stop thinking about him.Ms. Lovelace did a very good job of descibing the countries which a love to read about. One thing I can say is that this book made me want to go visit Venice.Most fans of the series would love this but to me I guess I was not really in the mood.I rate this a 2/5.FCC Disclaimer: I borrowed this from my local library. I am also an Amazon Associate. I was not paid for my opinion and what is expressed is solely my opinion.
1, The Best Cd ever: I loved Destiny's Chilc since I heard No
0, Destiny's Child: SWV and TLC you're not: Who are you trying to be Destiny's Child? Good question. They seem like they are trying to be a carbon copy of SWV
0, Horrible and seriously
1, Two good parts that give it 4 stars: I haven't seen the whole movie but just the parts I want to see. Such as... Ewen Mcgregor making out with Johnathan Rhys-Myers How hot is that!!!! It's great! and then to see Ewen Mcgregor ALL OF HIM bouncing around just mmm ehhh droooool yummmm eee whooo who cares about plot when you have TWO GUYS MAKING OUT?!
1, Eye & Ear Candy: SPOILER ALERTWatching two of the hottest guys making out
0," this movie is an angry ""spin"" on the real story: ""Brian Slade"" is the villain of the film. He is"
1, At last! An historical error!: Aha! I got you
1, Exceeded My Expectations: I own the entire 21 books in this series
0, New Bluray Video Butchered.: If you care about this film at all
0, Apple screws me for first and last time: Well
1, FAB: Greased Lightning is a great cleaner if you buy the right strength. The stuff sold in grocery/discount stores is watered down. You have to go to Lowes or a hardware store to get the professional strength. Be careful though; it will take the varnish and stain off of furniture and will ruin painted surfaces like kitchen cabinets if sprayed directly on them. You have to spray a damp cloth and then clean a painted surface starting at the bottom of the cabinet. If you spray it directly on your cabinets it will leave marks where it runs down. But for cutting gunk and grease it's wonderful.
1," Fresh perspective on positional chess: I picked this book at a recent Malaysian local PCMM open in Kuala Lumpur. I was interested in the title having read ""Excelling in Positional Chess"" by Aagard.The chapters started with analysing chess space: Strong Weak Squares"
1, I love these socks!: These socks are great! They keep my feet nice and dry when I workout; not so much as a drop of sweat! Nice! I also love these socks because the fabric doesn't pile even after several washing and years of usage. Love 'em!
1, VERY CANDID: I completely enjoyed reading this book. She tells it just as it was without any PR face. I really apreciate being able to take an in-depth look at how things function and I found the advice invaluable.
1, Came in stated condition.: I read the previous reviews and many complained of a strong
1, My Green Mat: I love this mat. I'm not a yoga expert at all
1, Nice Mat: This mat is very comfortable and has just the right tackiness to prevent sliding duing yoga postures. It's not as wide as I would have liked
0, for die-hard vincent perez fans only...: i have to say i was pretty disappointed by this film. afterseeing indochine
1, What An Eye Opener: I never dreamed there were so many different types of folds! Working on my present figure drawing with a smile on my face. Thanks to the author.
1, Great series and wonderful actress!: Anyone who hasnt seen this series is missing out big time. The sets
0, Disappointment: Good device
0, Navigator: Not what i expected to hard to set upHard to readWas not accuratetried to use it for land markings
1, A Real Suprise!: Being a collector of all things Native American I had bought a Ben Greene movie regarding Native Legends and during the pruchase phase it was suggested by Amazon that I might like POW WOW Highway..... Like It? I was thrilled and suprised to find that Pow Wow Highway was even better than my original choice. A well acted movie with an entertaining story line. Even had a legend thread thrown in to boot!A good argument for 'Never Give Up
1, Authentic: At the time of purchase I was dating a man who is 3/4 Cheyenne. He loves this movie - says it is authentic of Native American culture. He grew up in Lame Deer
1, Lost treasure: I had looked for a VHS or DVD copy of the Movie version of this book not realizing that it was created from a brilliantly written book. I stumbled across the book and the same time I found the DVD. The presented a very real and very spiritual view of life on a Lakota Rez. The problems are all too real
1, Seven dials Mystery is a fun movie: We so enjoy all of Agatha Christie's movies. The books are especially wonderful with no bedroom scenes or skin showing - the movies are sometimes not that way. What a talented and gifted woman. We are so glad we bought this movie
1, Great so far: Have only used a few times for tea bread and meatloaf
0, Not as good as I remembered......: I totally agree with the DVD transfer being really bad. But I also think the movie wasn't as great as I remembered when I was a kid. It seemed shorter and not as exciting. I am a fan of all the actors
1, magical cinematic expression: The story of Alec and Black and the strong bond between them was one of my favorite movies as a kid
1, I love this movie!!: I first saw this movie in 1994. I loved it then and have been trying to find it since. No one carried it (to obscure). Thanks to Amazon.com for re-releasing it on video. I still love this movie and will be eagerly awaiting it's arrival!The fight scenes are poetry in motion! Beautiful!
0, Only because it attracts so many new capoeiristas: I don't understand how people could love this movie as much as some apparently do. The fact that its the only american movie where the hero is specifically a capoeirista does not make up for the fact that the script is horrible and very little of the capoeira in the movie is actually worth watching unless you are completely unfamiliar with the art. For me
1, Oregen Scientific UV Sensor: This item is very useful for determining your burn time in the sun dependant on your skin type. It is relatively simple to set up for an individual user.Totally worthwhile if you are a person who works outside on a daily basis
1, DARN GOOD TOOL/INSTRUMENT: I have recently been exploring SUNGAZING and I wanted to be responsible regarding the care of my eyes. This monitor is exceedingly user friendly regarding UV readings with the added plus of giving an estimated time for being safe in the sun light. I also use the time function as I have recently dispensed with wearing a watch on my wrist. I'm interested in temperature as well but only in a casual way. The monitor is a bit slow in terms of adjusting for the temperature
0, Made me feel drunk...don't recommend.: This product gave me a headache and made me feel disoriented
1, Wooden acting and bad FX can't stunt the power of this film: A trash classic. A mute garment worker is raped twice within a few hours. She gets a gun and begins killing every man who makes a sleazy pass at her. That's it. The late Zoe Tamerlis Lund carries the film with a spooky performance. And Abel Ferrara gives everything a gritty sheen that he later perfected in films like KING OF NEW YORK and BAD LIEUTENANT.
0, Sturdy
0, Too small and fragile: I'm sure this may be a good buy for the right application but the umbrella would have to be very small in diameter. When I tried to install it
0, Not A Good Movie: This film
0, A good idea: gone bad. This film was not completely terrible but it is no horror classic
0, Trite Psychobabble: Over a period of decades sociologists have noticed an interesting trend: people who win Nobel Prizes
0, This book needs an extra chapter.: I think this book is ok if you are already familar with the task bar and menu. I use other microsoft office applications and understood some of the feautres that are similar. However the author assumes you know ALL the commands in the task bar and menu. I didn't know where some of the buttons and commands are that are unique to this applications. This book didn't cover the menu of project 98 clearly enough for those who have never used the application.
0," Great Series - 5th Season was was worst: A poor ending to a great series. One word to describe ""Disappointing""."
0," its written out of pure fantasy: I say very simple: this book is pure fantasy.Just read the 2 pages about the ""secret swimming pool"" (which for some reason is deleted from the audio version) and tell me if its anything more then ostrovsky's wild dreams?"
0, Disappointing...: One of the items had unsealed so there was soap and basket particles everywhere. Not sure whether to return it or try to clean it up.
0, Pin hole leaks: The chaise cover looks and fits great. However
0, Seems sturdy but tears easily: I was originally delighted with what appeared to be sturdy construction.After a few months
1, Good
1, The ultimate in 60's garage punk: Those people who discovered the Captain on Trout Mask Replica will be surprised as I was to hear Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band before they wrote songs with titles like Neon Meate Dream of an Octafish. Which is not to say this album isn't weird
0, Didn't work.: Disc did not play
1, Delightful romantic comedy: Keven Kline does a fabulous job. He's almost more believable as a Frenchman than Jean Reno! Watch this one with someone you love.
1, Formulaic but ...: enjoyable romantic comedy
1, Nilsson in his best period: Does humor belong in music? I think these album prove it. Nilsson in suberb shape backed up by great musicians like Bobby Keys
1, Baby Animals: This is a nice little book for babies that are just starting to learn how to turn pages. It's a small little chunky book and if you have an animal loving child this is a great book for them.
0, Don't waste your money!!!!: I used to use the original Bare Minerals
1, mineral makeup: This is the perfect makeup for people with sensitive skin. I have tried other mineral makeup products. This is the best. A little goes a long way. It is worth every penny
1, Wonderful Product!: I will never use any other type of make-up now besides bare minerals! The Matte Foundation is now a mainstay in my make-up collection!
0, Expired product...disappointed.: I have used this foundation for years and was excited to find it on Amazon since I'm a Prime member and could get it fast with my free two-day shipping. The product is new in the box
0, Preface to Marketing Management: Adequate as a required text. Would only buy it because it is required. The saving grace is that the title does say it is a preface to marketing management. It is not a primer on marketing management
0, Don't waste your money: This video is not a video for a young child just learning how to use a potty. It is more for the child who just needs some brushing up on how to have good potty hygiene. The whole story line is this 4yr olds birthday party. They make the trip to the potty fun. The message being that the party will still be there when you get back. The typical 4yr old dilemma
1, a captivating saga of yet another victimized woman's life: The title of this book threw me off. But when I read the synopsis
0, WARNING: The Very Worst of Kolchak!!!: Understand -- I am the world's biggest NIGHT STALKER fan. I saw the premiere at age 11. I own every single episode on video
0, Not for the long haul: We purchased this in January 2011 and already there are 2 rips in it. We will need to purchase a replacement one. The material is medium weight- thought it would last longer than 1 3/4 years.
0, DO NOT buy this product.Waste of $$!: DO NOT buy this item.WASTE of $$$.Totally cracked and ripped within 3 months of purchase due to sun exposure.Isn't this what the cover is for---sun protection?!Once covered for the season we didn't even remove the cover from our patio furniture until 3 months later and only uncovered/recovered patio set about 3 times before noticing major disintegration.We handled cover VERY carefully---damage is obviously from sun damage here in Southern California---dried
0, Nice to look at
1," You need to read the whole book! Starts slow....: but is well worth the wait. If you've read Ms. Dain before then you know that she is a good writer. This book starts slow. I should say the first few pages are intriguing and then the next 25 are slow. This is called ""building the characters"".If you put the book down at this point then you really miss out on the whole story. Elsbeth's ""Period"" plays a small part in the beginning of her unwanted marriage to Hugh of Jeruselem. Maybe someone didn't continue on but the story of an unwanted marriage and trickery on Hugh's part are what the story are about."
0, Nasty
1, My favorite Genesis album coupled with a great bonus DVD: Duke is my favorite Genesis album
1, Rachel Ray Skillet: I just absolutely love this skillet the only problem is I now wish I had purchased the 12 inch instead of the 10 inch.
1, Miracle On 34th Street: Usually a remake of an original does not pass the test of being better. This one certainly does surpass the original although both versions are great. If you like Natalie Wood then the original version is for you. This one with Richard Attenborough will certainly warm your heart. The entire cast was perfect for this movie. Enjoy!
0, Horrible Remake: I believe this is the worst remake ever made! It doesn't deserve the name! The original movie was about a little girl who didn't know any fairy tales. She didn't mind because she didn't know any better.In the new movie she seems like an abused child! That is only one of the things wrong with the feel and look of this horrible thing. The cuteness of the original is completely lost in this movie. I really really hated it. All the fun and sweetness of the original is completely missing in this one. What a shame this movie was ever made. I feel sorry for people that see this movie first (or at all) before seeing the orginal!I gave it one star because I didn't have the option to give it multiple negative stars!
0, too cutesy: The original had charm
0, So Bad So Bad: Sometimes I like remakes but this one was so bad. I am 16 years old and was brought up on the orignal black and white version. And that was a great family classic. But this movie was so bad. Why
1, movie: This is a classic movie for all ages. I have been looking for it for awhile and found it on amazon when no where else seemed to have it. It came in perfect condition.
1, classic movie--still brilliant: This timeless classic is beautiful on Blu-ray and still carries with it the spirit of Christmas. A must-see year after year.
1, De Jong/Sendak perfect match!: I love all kind of animals and above all dogs
1, Very good family read aloud.: I recently read this book out loud to my family- husband and kids 8
1, A Good Beginning: I appreciated the inside view of some aspects of the Iditarod. Now I want to know more. I'd like to see a second chapter with personal information re: experiencing the days on the ride.
1, Subtle
1," a couple of good rarities: This compilation has an edited version of ""Figure Of Eight"""
1, deeply touched: THIS SHOULD BE A MUST READ FOR KIDS AND ADULTS..THERE WAS TIMES WHEN I HAD TO PUT THIS DOWN I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED AND INSPIRED HOW STRONG AND BRAVE THE LOST BOYS WERE..JUST IMAGINE YOUR CHILD GOING THROUGH SUCH TERRIBLE LIFE HARD TO IMAGINE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE ONES THERE AGE.THIS IS KIDS FOR GOD SAKE..NEEDS TO STOP..SADDENS ME
0, Animal HIde and Seek: Was disappointing in the quality. One flap was completely gone when received. Several of the flaps were worn pretty badly. I will not buy from this company again.
1, Useful: This book is very informative
0, HO Train: I was very disapointed in this item. It fell well short of what I expected. Even with the discount
0, WARNING: Fellas-Trust me here. Dont let your girl rope you into this one.Just say no.or else its...MEESSAAAA CHICKOBEEEE...for 8 hours.
0, More sterotypes from Hollywood: Why is it that Hollywood just can't resist those southern Appalachian stereotypes? This movie was based on a stage play that was set in the Pacific northwest
1, excellent movie: another fine performance for Liam and Jodie. the story is very touching and the ending perfect. good movie with your wife/sweet heart. some nudity is included but is not really needed to support the story line. too bad real life doesn't usually end as well.
1, Great performances: This movie is outstanding. I show it to my sociology class as a lesson on sociolization or the lack thereof and the effect on an individual.
1, Not a bad book: This work is not about rehashing the passion of Christ. It is more about how even the more stable among us can get caught up in hero worship
0, Pointless: There's not much of a mystery
0, Too slow and boring...couldn't finish it.: I got one-quarter through this book
0, RIP OFF: This company is a rip off. I never got my order and they still want to charge me for shipping. Also their schedualed delivery time was 26 days. I doubt I will be doing any more business with Amazon
0, Predictable: This was not a good Doris Day film. The script and plot were ridiculous and predictable. Just a silly movie that was not very creative.
0," DON""T BE FOOLED!!!! THE REAL THING.....: don't be fooled by its ""real"" price before sales I have no idea what they were thinking $$$99.99...!!??? So if you think that you are getting a bargain you are NOT"
1, Kick ass: It's so funny reading reviews from little kids who've watched these movies in 2000 and 2001 for the first time. I'm 21
0, Fo Rizzle
1, Absolutely Beautiful: Great lyrics
0," What happened here? There's not even ""Life for free"" :(: I was so excited to pick up this CD"
1, love this cd!!!: Dido rocks. i love every track on this album
1," AWESOME ALBUM: Life for rent is another awesome album by Dido. It is a bit more laid back than ""No Angel"" but in my opinion"
0, What happened to Dido?: My God
1, You'll love this cd!: Are you looking for a cd full of dance tunes
1, excellent: i actually got my hands on this album before the release
0, Trip-hop for 40-somethings: Its so sad that an artist like Dido
1, Dido is the best: I just bought Life for Rent today it was 15 bucks but I don't regret it at all.This cd is really good
0, WHITE FLAG BY DIDO (LIFE FOR RENT CD): I only have webtv and not a computer.The sound clips I've heard from different companies(AMAZON INCLUDED) are SO BRIEF
1, Life For Rent: This is an album that has grown on me a little more with each listen. At first
1, Soothing
1, Is there a bad song on this CD?: Perhaps it is the exact moment this music came into my life
1, Dido's Songs Are Beautiful!: I love how Dido has written an album that is popular-but not bland like some top hits are. She is never afraid of bringing her album into dark places (where I think the album becomes stunningly beautiful. Ex: Do you have a little time and White Flag)her voice is like the reassuring
0, God awful.: First published in 1961 as part of the Cool and Lam detective series
1, One Of Marcia's Best Albums: My long search is finally over. For years I've been searching for this album without success. Thanks to Amazon.ca. This album is among the finest that Marcia has made. Her rendition of certain songs are superb and I can describe this album with one word...SUPERLATIVE
1, wonderfully done: I especially enjoyed this book because he gave you an honest account of his rise to fame. His was not an easy journey and took a toll on his spirit and creativity. To see one of his performances you'd never guess the obstacles he had to overcome. It was inspiring and uplifting. Yanni fans will enjoy this look at the man and his music.
1, He's not the same as his music: It's amazing to read that this man who makes such wonderful harmonies is himself thoroughly self-centered. He's at peace with that - he's just self-centered! There are reasons he never married
1, This book forces you to sit back and be amazed: This is my first Vonnegut novel. With a quick pace and bizzare set of stories it kept me intrigued through and through. In my experience people either label Vonnegut as one of the best authors of our era
0, Vonnegut's worst: Of all the books in Vonnegut's body of work
0, Thinly entertaining: Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica? Maybe in l941 America had its mind on the war and movies
1, Excellent: I love this CD. I have been a fan of Bossa Nova for as long as I can remember
0," B-movie that could of: Thinking that since Wes Craven directed this movie that it would at least be semi-good since he directed such b-movies like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or spoof movies like ""scream"". Boy was I wrong. The idea was definately there. However"
1," The Book That Started My Fascination With Her Work.: I first heard about Jackie Collins during of all places an ""English"" Class and when I read the passage featuring Carrie"
0, defective?: Probably I got a defective one
1, Amazing: What an amazing little speaker. In fact
0, Unlike anything else I've seen - Worth Reading: Truly a unique book. Written by a large
1, Great movies
0, Great story if only the language was cleaner.: YIKES.. Saw this on TV a while back and there was no cussing. Bought the DVD and wow
1, Outstanding film that has been overlooked..: This is no doubt on my top 10 movies of all time
1, Insightful and Moving: When it comes to the world of finance
1, A moving tale about courage and hope: When September 11
1, IB: very good purchase for my daughter
1, Love them: This review is very deserving of 5 stars. My boyfriend needed a new pair of chucks for work that matched his uniform... we don't wear many other types of shoes.. Love chuck taylors! 5 stars for fast shipping
1, Chucks are Always awesome: Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse.
1, Converses are awesome!: What can I say? These shoes are insanely comfortable and go with everything. The more worn they get the better they look.
0, very good runner: I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years. They love the colors
0," Triad ""Remastered Edition"" of The Stranger is a lousy copy.: The Stranger is an interesting film"
0, DVD The Stranger: VERY DISAPPOINTED - DVD WAS BLANK!!! I ordered this DVD as a Christmas gift in early December. I was informed day after Christmas that the DVD was blank. Unfortunately I miss placed the shipping info
1, Classic Suspense: Good story
1," Outstanding!: I haven't heard her ""Revolution in Me"" album yet but i know it will hit stores soon. Siobhan Donaghy"
0, ...: It only comes to show you
1, I used this for the father-daughter dances at both daughters wedding.: I love this album. I have it in the original pristine vinyl from when it came out and in CD format for casual listening.I used to pick up my daughters and waltz with them when they were very small
1, A Most Satisfying Fall: Juliane and Ulrich really are legends in their time. She has the dubious honor of being the Queen of the Frigid and he has the sole distinction of being the King of Seduction. As the story unfolds
0, how does this get on a romance shelf?: This book is so full of rape and violence I wonder if it wasn't written by a man using a pen name. The main character gets brutally raped and then has sex with her husband in front of a group of people like in a bad porn movie. I felt like I needed a bath after this. How does this stuff ever get published as romance which is supposed to be love? Gross porngraphic and disgusting
1, The best book ever!!!: I thought and truly felt that Paula Danziger's
1, Real Cecher: I loved this book its fast paced easy to read book!! I read this book a long time ago..You feel like you are the main person
0, $150 of Repairs in 5 Years: We've had an earlier model range hood style Sharp oven for five years. We've had to replace the circuit board and it has gone through three door handles. There is no one in our household who misuses appliances
1," Bolivia: I read the danish version of the book because i was suposed to write an essay on the life of Che. After reading this book i found out realy what kind of person he was and he is as we call it in Norway ""KONGE"" (king)"
1, Fantastic Workout: This is not your usual Pilates DVD. It is a blend of aerobic and toning as well as strength training. You will definitely sweat. I really enjoyed this workout. It's a total 45 minute workout
1, Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates: Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates is a great workout. It is especially good for ex ballet dancers. The workout is fun and includes a great mat sequence and stretches for the back.
0, Surprised by small capacity.: I had been looking for a nine inch square baking dish
1, If you Liked Da Vinci Code....: The quest for the Grail is one of the most fascinating subjects in all of literature. John McLaughlin's book takes it in a direction that goes beyond what Dan Brown laid out in DA VINCI CODE--from the distant past into a possible future. The G.R.A.I.L. is a healing object which gives eternal life. The ageless keepers of the G.R.A.I.L influence major world events and world leaders from early in recorded history
0, No fun at all
0, don't buy: Whoever designed this product never used it. Almost impossible to line up the lid with the spin mechanism. The bowl is not perforated so all the muck you spin out seaps back into the food.
1, 'In Death' series: This is an awesome book as is the whole series. JD Robb is an amazing author! Would recommend to anyone I know.
1, Old and New World co-exist: This movie was a delight to watch. It's simple presentation of tradition and the power it holds trying to bond with the here and now. It shows that you can hold on to your beliefs and values and still find happiness. Beautifully acted.............camera work wonderful.......director did a great job.
0, Mistress of Bland: I love many of the actors in `Mistress of Spices'
1, Excellent service: This product arrived earlier than expected and was exactly as it was stated on the advertisement for it. Excellent service and I appreciate it. As usual
0, Main cord sticks to the side when plugged in: The way most outlets are installed on the wall
1, Perfect best little power strip: I love this power strip because it folds and there are outlets on both sides. Great for when I am on the go filming.
1, perfect: I am never traveling without this again. great for airports
1, For more than just travel!: After reading through the reviews it appeared that most people purchased this item expressly for travel. My motivation was different. Setting up a wall mount flat screen TV
1, Perfect for travel: I purchased this power strip to take to Europe. Combined with a plug adapter
1, I love this thing: I travel frequently with numerous electronics
1, great deal: travel a lot and never can find enough plugs in the hotel room to plug in my phone and computer this is a great deal
1, Great 80's movie: When I first saw this movie on video i immedaitally loved it. It had suspense
0," Very bad....: I don't understand why the producers of this movie chose Uruguay to make it look like a terrorist country. I am from Uruguay and the information shown in the movie is totally wrong.And some people say: "" but it's not a documentary"
0, Don't do it!: This is not the Seagal of the early nineties. Something has happened to him and it's not good. He's gained weight
0, Simply Awful: If you thought that The Foreigner was bad
1, Silence of the Lambs in the Ghetto: This is a fine
0, Braun's Great
0, not the best: Not one of the better ones. Really shallowly written. Sounds like a ghost writer (the ghost writer's first book in the series) to me.
0, remastered
0, sad: this plastic box 
1, Funny but typical: This seems to follow a typical pattern of Danny Kaye movies: a zero turns into a hero. However
0, Not much help: This book was not much help to me when trying to learn about music of the classical and romantic era. The text is very vague and poorly written
0, Interesting
0," Mediocre: After reading ""The Name Of The Rose"" and ""Foucalt's Pendulum"" Imust say this is a mediocre book for Eco's standards"
0, Pointless read with a handful of interesting tangents: island of the day before is a waste of time. I am a fan of umberto eco
1, A very good book- one story on top of another: This book is really wonderful. It all takes place upon an abandoned ship
0, A fantastic journey to... where?: Eco's style and fluidity are again inspiring. Oh to be Roberto! Some of the time. At times I find myself a stowaway
0, Write on but not wipe off: This product says write-on/wipe-off
1, Not quite the best: I was looking for recipes that was easy and none complicated. To many of the recipes had ingredents that were not alway in your pantry. I also have the next Lorna J. Sass pressure cookers cook book. This book is very much the same as this one. But it has much of the alike recipes.
0, WTF?: This is worse than terrible and it isn't 90 minutes
0, Why I won't buy it...: I have always wanted a DVD of this Nutcracker ballet company. But when reading the specs they said it won't play on recordable DVD's or PC's. I have a home theater system plus another DVD recorder/player so I don't want to take a chance it could be ruined or I wouldn't be able to play. Bummer!!!
0," Very Disappointing: I agree with the reviewer ""Diatonic"" - the prince looks like a lecher from Central Casting and moreover"
0, Not what it is said to be: If you are even thinking of getting this gun
0, Cute story
0, Crap bought from Amazon: I have never ever been sold just the inner part of a taper roller bearing!! Why have I been sold just the inner race which I thought was a fair price but now I have to source the outer cup separately making the deal quite a lot more. I ordered the inner wheel bearings for my RV at the same time and they have not arrived yt - I guess that will only be part of the bearing too.I will never buy from Amazon again.
1, An Excellent Horror Film!: One of my favorite horror films of all time. This film should not go unnoticed. A sleeper of sorts
1, I Thought It Was Laughable But...: A cool strong woman in Jada Pinkett Smith. A horror show that tackles religious themes. William Sadler (for me
1, This Movie is top notch in Horror cult classic status: Im a Horror buff and this movie ranks up there with the classic cult flims like evil dead and dawn of the dead
1, A work of genius: A work of genius
0, Any more than 2 stars and you are just an Amy worshiper.: She has a killer voice and backed up with the real world passion of her origional back was a match made in heaven. This new thrown together corporate money grabber depends on the briliance of Amy's voice to sell it. Just another example of hype for the masses. This album has no teeth. It makes great mall/elevator music though.
0, Wouldn't have bought a second album if this were their first: Fallen was a very strong album--heck
0," Disappointing: I waited patiently for years and finally they put out a new album. I was a huge fan of these guys because i believed ""Fallen"" was a great album. When their guitarist left i thought it was a big deal because his lyrics and musical contribution itself was a big part of this band. But the guitarist of Cold"
0, What the?: The tracks on this CD are so complicated and so intelligible that it requires a supercomputer just to analyze it. The Open Door simply does not make any sense. A CD is supposed to contain music. This CD is has no music on it. Maybe if we sent a radio signal of this CD to outer space we'd get a response from E.T. In the meantime
0, I don't see how people like this radio drivel: Bad..same as all the other radio
0, Atrocious: This CD is just a horrible follow up to a band that had a great unique sound. Gone is the heaviness and darkness that surrounded their first CD. Instead
1, wow: Service was fantastic! I received it BEFORE the date promised and I love this album! Top Notch service all around
1, Excellent!: Not sure where people get that this is similiar to any other music out there. Evanescence is a breed of its own and their music is absolutely breathtaking!Anyone who loved the first one should love the second one just as much.Love it!
0, Say goodbye to Evanescence.: TOD is a pretty significant departure
0, DIE CHUCKY DIE DIE!!!: Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: Oh
0, Who writes these movies?: If you're over 14 you probably won't like this movie. I was really into it when it came out over a decade ago
1, 41 Original Hits From The Soundtrack Of American Graffiti: This is a great soundtrack
1, Snow Drift Cutter Kit: Rate 4 given because I have not been able to use them so far this year.Like the weight and mounting.Anyone that lives with big snow falls.
1, A fun retro gas station: The Bachmann Trains Gas Station was easy to put together and I had it done in just a few minutes. You have the choice of using Shell or Texaco decals. It would have been nice had the windows and doors had clear plastic in them but for the price
0, Keep shopping: I have owned this blanket for less than a month so I cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability
0, Crude Tool: 1. Not a very well made machine.2. Trying to add all of the options is impossible.3. The expander cannot be bolted into the machine.4. The drill bits are poor quality and difficult to install and use.5. The handle to pull the drill bit into the material is hard to pull. No touch at all using the handle.6. The machine came all greasy and was difficult to wipedown. It was a mess.7. It was easier to setup my drill press and use than using this machine.
0, Very poor quality: When this machine went on sale for $145 shipped
1, Delta Mortising Manchie 14-651: I purchased this through Amazon and it came well packed and undamaged
0, Professional?....Not even close: This is an example where pretty good engineering is erased by lousy quality control. The machine work is extremely rough and the table and fence took hours of grinding and filing to get them half way smooth. Once the parts are smooth enough to be assembled
1, Great tool: I was torn between the Jet and this unit - especially after reading the reviews about the Delta unit getting broken in transit on more than one occasion. I figured that everyone seemed happy IF it arrived in one piece
1," FP38 Cabin Filter: This filter fits my 2002 Ford Focus SVT perfect.For some reason Ford Motor Company decided to ""cut costs"" and not install these from the factory. Instead they used a black filler piece which filters absolutely NOTHING. Glad I found this and it's not a bad price."
1, Love Jodeci: Jodeci has always been one of my favorite bands. Diary of A Mad Band is one of my favorite albums. They always deliver great music that is soulful
1, STILL FOREVER JODECI: THIS CD IS BASICALLY VERY GOOD AS FAR AS THE SLOW SIDE GOES
1, Good with some small changes: I have had the product for over a year. As noted by others the bag change is a problem (painful and dirty). I have a small shop area and this machine fit in space I had. I did add one of the separators that fit on a trash can and it worked fair for me. The bags seem to leave a little more fine duct in the shop than I wanted. I put on Penn State Industry oversized 1 micro bags which improved the working of the separator and the decreased the dust. All in all
0, Loud and unstable: If it wasn't for the really low price on this I would be very upset with the purchase. It's my first Delta tool and has left me disappointed. It is much louder than the other reviews indicate. Forget talking to anyone while it's on (in a small shop at least). It is also very top heavy and is extremely easy to tip. Hit one expansion joint in the concrete and down she goes. I'm trying to figure out a way to put it in the attic and run hoses because otherwise I can't see myself using this dust collector.
0," Time to throw in the towel: I thought this CD was horrible....Personally I think if your a old school G&R fan or an STP fan you will be throughly disappointed as I was...""Slither"" is one of the only decent songs on the CD (and I stress decent because it is not that great)...Maybe its just me but I really really thought it did not live up to STP or G&R type of expectations...Maybe a better producer would have helped..Want to hear a meshing of 2 bands for a good sound then go get AUDIOSLAVE...just click your back button and get as far away from this CD..."
1, Better than expected: This CD rocks
1," Pretty good rock album: ""Contraband"" by Velvet Revolver isn't as good as Guns n' Roses or Stone Temple Pilots"
0, Completely Uninspired: I bought this cd the day it came out
0, I was expecting so much more.: I don't really have much to say. I really can't praise this album.....at all.Since I had the chance to listen to it repeatedly at the cd store I work at
0, Lose Your Illusion...: I really try to like this
1," Excellent CD: I think I approached this CD from a different angle than most people. I heard the CD before I knew who the band members were! I told my friend ""hey"
1, Almost Every Song Is A Hit !!!: I love Guns N Roses and when I heard that Slash and Duff were going to make a superband I was hyped about it. It took me a few weeks to pick this up after it came out but when I did I fell in love with it :) Some of the best songs on it are Slither (the single)
0, It's OK: I really didn't know what to expect so I wasn't disappointed. But I wasn't all that impressed
0, good for getting girls to dance @ a party-that's all!!!: god
0, Contrafan: Come on...we BUY the CD and can't put it on our ipod!!Sure install software to create security breaches in your system.AND only 2 good songs...what a rip.1 star for the music.-1 star for greed. THIS IS A HUGE ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1, People judge the music: I was looking forward to this CD and I can say that I am not disappointed at all. While I am disappointed that it is difficult to rip into my computer
0, faded glory: I heard this CD initially from a friend's burned off copy
0, Not PC friendly!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Warning
0, A dreadful album
0, Overblown overhyped: You would think the the history of the artists combining for this CD would mean something new and exciting. NOT! Same old tired routines that these artists have been selling the braindead fans for the last few years. They aren't concerned with making people think with new and different sounds. They are concerned with selling to people that have no imagination!
1, Astra Yarn - Ombres: Believe it or not
1, Great
1, Apocryha: This a perfect addition to yourBible. It was once part to the Bible andgives the reader more to study and understandsome of the references to the stories it containsthat may be mentioned in other religious literature.
0, Robuster: For the money not a good buy.The book is old and can be bought at any used book store for a quarter.I love everything he has wrote and bought this book when it came out.It started me on the Burke bandwagon.Good book but way over priced.Save your hard earned money and buy USED.
0," Another that deserves ""zero Stars"" ...: Come on people"
0, Great for Senior Citizens: If you like boring music and cool video transitions this is the movie for you. I think the editor of this movie was having more fun playing with the transition effects buttons on his new PowerMac than actually trying to get people excited about climbing. Of you want to see the physical strength
1, Easy setup car seat good fit and easy to use: We have this seat and an evenflow.The good: This one is the seat that I choose to move from car to car (grandma etc) since it's fasten system is the easiest of every car seat I have ever used
0, lock-offs seem flimsy: I bought the britax because in my opinion
1, missed opportunity: I was waiting for this book to come out for a while and I got one of the first copies that came out. I am hugely disapointed. Ofcourse
1, Danner Pronghorn: Best Snakeboots you can own! When the Jackel snakeboot was discontinued
0, Did not fit Kohler toilet - returned item: Plumber could not install this handle on Kohler toilet. The color was right but the fit was wrong. I returned this item.
1, Product great
0, it never flushed correctly
0, Same as Tayama Air Cooler TC-998-BAD!: This unit is the same as the Tayama Air Cooler TC-998 and works as poorly.Only after filling the entire tray with ice and water chilled overnight does this thing have any cooling effect and even than
0, A piece of junk: The remote worked well but that was about it. It did not put out any cool air. I've since purchased a Ultracool with the same capacity (water and BTU reduction) and it works very well. It keeps my entire 29' Fifth wheel at very livable temps. For instance
1, Why is everyone bitching?: You're supposed to give GOOD records GOOD reviews...duuuuh. See there is SOME good hardcore that is creative. And now the mountain of imitators comes....agghh
0, Not impressed compared to Red Herrings: It is OK but I would expect much higher level for the author. Plots are no captivating
0, Perfect purchase: I'm a 57yo female with medium size hands. I love having all the different colors and strength. I've recently started martial arts and firearm safety classes. My firearm instuction mentioned I need to strengthen my trigger finger. This is an excellent way to do that. Smooth transaction. Glad I purchased.
1, Handy
0, Good Dust Collector But.....: This device works well as a dust collector but not a chip collector. I have tried to use it with a thickness planer but the chips clog on the intake opening cross bar. It works with my router dust vent okay. I assume it work okay with an sanding table. Don't expect too much from this.
0," Poor workmanship: The stone fell out of the setting the first time I wore it. Luckily I found the stone right away. I placed the ring and the stone in a small pocket in my purse as I had nothing else to store it in at the time.The ""gold"" setting was so flimsy that it bent out of shape while it was in my purse for a few hours."
1, $2.99 ea?: I'm still trying to figure out what people are saying here. 24 moozles at $66 = $2.75 ea. And yes that is each. But even at $2.99 each
0, Just wretched: An incoherent mess from an anvil-handed hack
0, The 700 Club is better than this film: This could possibly be the worst film I have ever seen. The acting is absolutely AWFUL.. I mean like the kind you don't even need to make fun of because it just isn't worth the effort. The cinematography is that of a 7 year old with daddy's video camera.. no worse than that. And the story is told in the refreshing manner of that...kid down the street who just got a new pack of Pokemon cards.I recommend this film to you only if your television only recieves The 700 Club.. and you have an allergic reaction to quality.
1, This is one of my favorite books: This book is especially helpful if you would like to quilt your own projects but find the bulk of a quilt too much to handle.The projects are fun. The pictures are great and the concept is easy.
1, Impressive!!!!: The quality of the Video is outstanding
1, Great: Love this thing and it works great. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when I got it it came with NO bag like the other reviewer got and it wasn't in the box. If I didn't know what I was doing I wouldn't know how to use it. It was just bubble wrapped in a big box with no directions. Over all I'm very happy.
0, Expectations dashed: I liked SG's first CD so much I went out and bought this one sight unseen (ear-unheard?). I disliked the slower ballad songs from the first CD and was hoping he would have at least an equal mix on the new one. No way. It was full of slow and boring ballads. Shaun

1, Nice cut: Great cutting saw
0, bad book: the book is poorly writen. fight of ideas. can not keep focus. waste of time to read it. I would rather stick with Harry potter.
0, boring: I didn't like this book. It was silly and juvenile in a bad way. I can tell it was his first book.
0, Junk: A jointer is supposed to allow you to put a square edge on stock (so
0, Put Your money toward something better: I'm on my second Delta jointer planer. The first planer was delivered with a bent in-feed table. The table was bent one half an inch down at the end of the table and had a large chip in the table top. It looked so bad I just look at it and shook my head in disbelief. I sent it back
1, Paranormal romance done right: A more engaging novel than the two previous in the Harmony series
1, Good Read: Well Done! Good story
0, An embarassment to all involved: Be advised that this was
1, Beautiful Cake Stand: Enjoyed this beautiful cake stand. Added to the cake very nicely. Bride and Groom were very pleased.
1," La Conjugaison por tous: Indispensable. It's THE reference for verbs and verbal grammar. I much prefer it to ""501 Verbs"" because (1) it concisely provides each unique conjugation pattern once and only once (which makes it easier to learn the pattern)"
1, Good Text Book: I needed this for a history class last semester. It came quite quickly and was very useful. This was an interesting book and did a good job of going into racial inequality issues in Detroit.
1, A well-written and unbiased look at the sad story of Detroit: As a resident of the metro Detroit area for the first 30 years of my life who finally fled last year
0, The Years Before AC/DC: Don't waste your money. I read other reviews after purchasing this item. All it contains is three early songs by Bon Scott with an image of Angus Young playing guitar. Note: Bon Scott was with another band or solo when he recorded these early songs. Your better off just buying a CD with his music. Also
1, A study in the might of the federal government: I was taught in school (the place where all my historical falsehoods began)that the civil war was a righteous battle to end slavery. This book gives a different perspective and exposes the federal government as the bully that I have come to know that it is. The constitutional rights of states are thoroughly explored in the states relationship to the federal government. The constitution has flaws in it by giving rights to some people living in the US at that time but not extending rights equally to all human beings. I wish by now that we could have evolved as a country to extend our belief in free rights to all people whether they are citizens or not and whether they are standing on our soil or not but we haven't. This book had some very interesting arguments on constitutional principals as well as examples of abuses of power by the federal government bringing to me a new perspective on the civil war that I was previously unaware of.

1, Review of Major Dundee: The disk arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.The film
0, It may be a fine comentary on the futility of war but it makes for a less than satisfying entertainment.: It's hard to tell what might have been without the reportedly significant studio editing and tampering with Peckinpah's movie. It would probably have been better. I doubt that it would have been great. There are some good scenes and good performances but overall the movie just drags along and then peters out at the end. It may be a fine comentary on the futility of war but it makes for a less than satisfying entertainment.
1, Hooray for Vintage Books!: This was the original book to the sequel before the author became famous. I ordered this after someone lost my paperback version.
1, Unforgettable Mama: I must say I found this book to be very enjoyable and quite a page turner. There were times I found myself both laughing out loud and weeping. This book can run the emotions. I highly recommend it as a great alternative to watching television.
1, Mother of a 3 and 4 yr old girls: Both my girls loved this toy. I needed something to keep them busy when I went out of town and I bought this toy and they spent hours playing together with this set. What I like most about it is all the stuff that comes with it fits inside of it and it is easy for them to clean up on their own.
1, Great Movie: I really love this movie. I watched about 3 times back to back. I like Kelly Preston because even though she was pretty...she definitely had a cute little potty mouth. I like the part when she wasted spaghetti sauce on her brand new pants...and she was cursing her butt off. I laughed so hard. Great movie!
1, A Secretly Good Film
1, A beautiful film: I like it very much.And i fall in love
0, I would not purchase this for someone else glad it was for my own baby: It arrived in a box however the plastic it was packed in once you opened the box was so dirty and black I just knew I would have to send it back however once I took it out the plastic it wasn't damaged or dirty at all just very wrinkle
1, Absolutely Fiery!: This is the perfect book for anyone who has owned
0, ok flick: This was one of lana clarkson's last movies before she was murdered by phil spector I believe. She deserved better than this very low budget flick which is ok at best. And it's not her fault it's just not the best done flick.
1, We wore out the CD!: Seriously. They say that CDs are supposed to be indestructable (under normal conditions
1, Does the job: Hi there
1, Bollywood at its best: Starts out appearing to be a light-hearted typical film
0, this product has issues: I loved it the minute I got it
1, Thought provoking: Life and death
1, Luminous!: A collection of well-crafted poems that take the reader across rural landscapes
1, Tajmah's Review: When I recieved the Norton Field Guide to Writing it looked as though it was practically brand new. No problems with it. I recommmend this product.
1, Great set -- does fit in knife block!: I almost didn't buy this set because another reviewer said the larger knife didn't fit in the knife block that comes with the 13-piece set. But I went ahead...and the knife fits easily in my knife block. I love all these knives
0, Violence doesn't make a movie exciting: I bought the film 'cos I wanted to see a realistic movie. This is not what I imagined.This is just violent
0, FOX LORBER EDITION IS TERRIBLE!: You are looking at an edition by Fox Lorber Films. I love this movie but this particular transfer onto DVD is TERRIBLE. The picture looks horrible and the audio is the WORST I've EVER seen on a DVD. Will SOMEBODY please issue a decent edition of Hard-Boiled or The Killer on DVD (yes I know about the criterion collection but I don't have $250.00 to spend on it now that they are out of print!).
0, Cory has better videos than this one ...: I bought this video but ended up returning it. It's not for a home workout but more a gym tutorial. Plus it is not done in Cory's normal style. Sorry Cory... If you are looking for some really good tapes by Cory
0, delta seven weeks and still waiting: If I knew what I know now I would think twice about buying delta products. Longer warranty does not mean that they can obtain the needed parts for service . For example I turned in my dp350 to an authorized service center 12-30-2004 for defective drill speed adjuster guess what? they could not obtain the needed parts til today 2-19-2004. Can you go without a needed tool for that length of time? Other delta products I own 
1, Great Bench top Drill press for the money: Purchased this unit as a gift for my father. I am very impressed with the unit. The drill press is plenty powerful enough for a home workshop and the variable speed pulley system is great. We have not had any issues with the spring coming undone and it looks like they might have redesigned the spring clip for the pulley. I only have two negative comments. First in order to lubricate the pulleys you have to remove six screws. It would be better if they had a hinge and quick release. The second issue was in the packaging and shipment. The box came destroyed with the styrofoam in several small pieces. The unit was not damaged and I fault the carrier for this issue.Overall a great unit and I am very impressed with all that you get for this price.
0, DON'T BUY IT!: I should not have ignored all the poor reviews I found on several sites about the variable speed control on this drill press. I figured they had tried to adjust it when it wasn't running. I took delivery on this drill press yesterday. The very first time I turned it on and
0, Flawed Design: After 2 1/2 years the bushings in the variable speed vbelt pulleys slipped on the spindel end and popped clear out on the motor end. This renders the drill press unusable and unfixable. The bushing and pulley are a single unit on the parts sheet. The problem is the alignment of the bushing and pulley are critical
1, Much Better Then Your Average Guide Book: This book povides a lot more then visitor information. I've read several guides to the Chesapeake Bay region and this is the only one that gives the reader a real feel for the area. Places an emphasis on the natural environment. Some guide books spend a lot of time on things around the Bay and ignore the BAY itself. This one has it all. I find myself going back to it often.
0," Needs a Warning Label: This book should carry a warning label that lets you know it's a 230-page infomercial for the Kabbalah Center. It contains little that hasn't been regurgitated from ""Rabbi"" Berg's work"
1, This guage is accurate!: Having had/used the Accu-gage Tire Pressure Guage - 60 PSI w/11 inch hose for a few months now
0, Naive introduction to the Gujarati language.: Speakers of closely related Indian languages may find this book useful
1," A warm and wonderful recording: I bought this album in the SACD format. The SACD format really does expand the sound stage reducing the ""listener fatigue"""
0, Pathetic .... Absolutely Pathetic: What a major disappointment
1, So soft!: My 1 year old does not yet know how to take the baby in and out of the pod but she does enjoy snuggling her baby when she sleeps. The materials used seem to be top notch
1, Cute plush doll.: We got this for our infant daughter
1, Cutest toy ever: I absolutely love this little doll. My baby is 8 months old and loves to hold and play with this little doll. It is so soft and easy for her to hold and cuddle with. It rarely stays inside the pod because baby loves to play with it. Really enjoy this product.
1, Precious!: This is in line with all the wonderful Manhattan Toy products. A precious little doll for a tiny baby.
1, The best there is to read!: An excellent read that penitrates the mind of a serial killer. What's more shocking is that it actually happened! Panzram details his life from childhood through the hardships of adulthood which made him the hardcore savage animal that he ultimately became. I loved every minute of this book! It's a shame that it's so hard to find though or I'd buy my own copy and read it every night before I go to bed. I suggest that anyone who wants something new and exciting to read should pick up this work and start reading. The public library should have it. Get moving!
0, Not good for my system: This product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. They Both were made in the citrate form. Unfortunately
0, Read Jung instead: I found this yet another rehash of classic Jungian psychotherapy. The writer was way too fond of his own voice. I found his endless repeating of basic tenants very iritating. If you have something new to say go ahead and say it just once.
1, Content excellent but let down by Kindle version.: The content is wonderful (though am I the only person who thinks Hollis' books all start to sound the same?). My matn gripe is that the chapters are jumbled in the Kindle version I've bought
1, My kids couldn't get enough!!: We checked this out from the library and my kids begged to watch it every day! We have a lot of kids videos and this was the first one that they didn't seem to tire of. We checked it out for probably 3 months straight. I will be purchasing this and the Rock N Learn Spanish video. We also checked out Rock N Learn: Letter Sounds and the kids loved it also. (My boys are 5
1," Soooooo comfortable!: This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned. I am a 34 G in the brand name Goddess but I am able to wear a 38 DDD in this bra. In my experience all my bras have had a painful ""break in"" period but this bra comes ""broke in"" right of the hangar. Ordinarily the underwire hurts my ribs for a while but the underwire in this bra doesn't really rest hard against your body. It's very unusual however very comfortable and provides nice support at the same time. Normally a sports bra gives a ""unaboob"" appearance but this sports bra gives nice seperation.When ordering keep in mind that the cup size runs large and the numbers run small. I highly recommend this bra."
1, poetry at it's best--you will give thanks: Lovely
1, nice book for a mini-retreat: Interesting writing style
1, I've read it 4 times now!: I've owned this book for years; I found a first edition in perfect condition at an estate sale & I've been hooked ever since! I've read it four times along with the others in her collections of books and I've spent a week up at Lakewood Camps in 07 and 09 and plan on going back in 2011. This is a great book and I can't recommend it more!
1, Perfect Meat Thermometer: It is very convenient to be able to BBQ one item and roast another@ the same time in different locations. When you know what the temps are
0, Bad choice: The first one of these I received from Amazon was DOA. They quickly sent a new one out(Thanks Amazon). The new will turn on but it doesn't work any better than the one that was DOA. My many complaints include that the unit easily loses the remote signal
0," Don't Work: I purchased this item just for the dual probe. I received it in the mail at my office I opened it up to test it and it 'seemed' to work just fine. I held one probe in my hand and left the other on my desk. The remote unit registered about 96 on my hand and 70 on my desk. So I pack everything back up and then last night I get it out to try it ""for real"" and I couldn't get the darn things to link. They would link for about 10 seconds and then the remote unit would light up like the forth of July and then be reset. Finally by the end of it all I couldn't get them to link at all. I ended up just using the transmitter unit to monitor temps (it has a small LCD window that displays only the temp). So the remote unit in my experience is just garbage.I did everything I could to fix it (ie new batteries in both units"
0, It's ok: I've had this for three years. It worked ok for while. Now the remote module won't communicate with the base thermometer
0, Cheap Product - Very Disappointed: This product is rated up to 500F. I was catering an event yesterday and preheated my grill to 325F and within two minutes of placing the meat and probe on the grill the wires burt and melted where the wire meets the probe. I can fully understand why this seller is rated 3 stars. I was cooking a dinner party for 50 and had to wing it on the meat because of this cheap product. It is a rip off for >41.00 with shipping.
0, Terrible: I ordered this thermometer based on what I thought was good reviews but this thing stinks. It takes forever to come up to temperature. I don't think it registers correctly. I wouldn't buy it again.
0, Returned the item: I had to return this item. It never worked correctly from the beginning. Setup was pretty easy. Simply follow the directions. The remote transmitter never worked more than 15 feet from the receiver. The transmitter unit never registered the temperature correctly. Transmission of temperature had a lag in it
0, No wireless Range: This had essentially no range for the wireless signal. Even 15 feet was too far for a connection
1, My BBQ Is Better: This wireless thermometer lets you cook two different items set for two different temperatures. The small black transmitter sits beside the BBQ while you remain fully informed of temps and times as you carry around the silver receiver or set it on the counter while getting the sides together. The buttons are less than intuitive
0, Avoid at all cost: This is the worst wireless device I have ever owned. You'll be lucky to keep the transmitter and receiver linked for more than 30 minutes. I even went so far as to return it to the manufacturer for a new one. The new one is just as bad as the old one. As I write this I'm trying to use it along with another brand (NU-Temp). The NU-Temp is on a pork roast and the Remote Check is on a whole chicken. The Remote check lost its connection with the transmitter after about 10 minutes. The NU-Temp is still working perfectly after an hour of use. Needless to say I will never buy this brand again.
0, Losses contact very often.: This wireless thermometer is a real dissapiontment. At 15 feet the reciever and transmiter lose contact with each other every 5 to 10 minutes
1, AWESOME & Easy To Use -- BUY 2: I bought this item lasy year and used it to make my Holiday turkey in the oven. It freed me up and allowed me to be with my family while cooking the meal at the same time. I've used it in the BBQ and a smoker.My son loved mine so much I gave it to him and ordered another. My friend wanted one so I gave HIM one.Save time
0, Borderline useless: Like others have posted
0, don't bother: I bought this for my husband the Grill Master. He hates it. It is complicated and clumbsy. Waisted my money !!!
0, Waste of Money: Sucks! You have to constantly reset it to get a signal. The temp reading on the sending unit works fine but you may as well throw the receiving unit in the garbage
0, Not good: The product is not as good as other remote temperature probes. I also have another one which works great
0, I really wanted this to work...: I love the features of this product
0, Trash and nonsense: I'd give this minus stars
0, Not Anne Perry's best: I've read most of the Pitt books (loved most of them) and have just started the Monk series. This was my least favorite of all Anne Perry's novels. It was compelling insofar as I had to keep reading to see the conclusion
1, A Quirky Religious Odyssey: Julia Sweeney is brilliant
0, Muy mal!: Me mandaron un producto con mala calidad
1, Just when you thought the future couldn't get any weirder...: I'll be honest. I haven't actually seen this tape
0, Great while it lasted: Zircon Ultrasonic Measure (DM S50L) This item worked for 2 days and did a great job. After that it only showed an error message. Working on getting a replacement.
1, It may not be perfect but it sure beats a tape measurer!: I am delighted to own this tool. Pay attention to how you hold it and it will serve you well. It can be a bit cumbersome to hold and push the READ button so just expect to take readings several times. Great for measuring rooms.
1, Great for public meetings: This mic is just plain great for meetings. I am a public official on a government board with 8 other members. Each Board Member has one of these mics which feeds the PA system. I find it very sensitive
1, x mitter: Works just as stated. No problems. Some complain about not being able to find open stations in bigger cities
0, Pure junk: This unit worked well for 3 days
0, Strong signal BUT cuts off High Freqs ! Get iRiver instead!: It cuts off High frequency range almost completely. I had iRiver FM transmitter for a couple of years until it broke
0, stopped working early: not recommended
0, Static: I figured this product would be good considering monster is a solid company
0, FM trnasmitter: First of all
0, Static!: You can barely hear the music over the static. Thought it might just be our car so we tried a couple friends' cars and it was the same. Total waste of money.
0, Worked great for half a year: The transmitter has worked well for me
0, FAILED EARLY: This transmitter worked better than it's Belkin predecessor but failed were the cord goes into the selector after only a year use. Needs better strain relief at that point.
1, Very good product: This transmitter BLOWS away the Belkin (Model: F8Z439-P-BBY) product.the difference is night and day!! Tried the Belkin and could not get a good clean transmission on any freq. Also the volume was so low
0, Nearly useless: I've now used this on two long car trips up and down the East Coast
0, Poor weak signal: Does not perform well
0, Didn't work at all
0, Weak.: This product is so inferior I almost can't believe I paid money for it. Even the slightest amount of volume in a song makes the sound dissolve into static. Trust me
0, Long on imagery
1, Quick results!: I started using the acnefree severe system a little over a month ago
0," Awful for skin!!!!!! Does not work!: Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and ""day cream"" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't"
1, This product really works!!!: My son and I both suffer with acne. I am now 34 yrs old and I have used almost every product on the market. I get extreme breakouts and so does my son. I have tried proactive
0, worked so-so: I bought this product for the first time ever and it worked great - my pimples were clearing up and my skin was really soft
1, Only used the spot treatment: So I haven't used the entire system but the spot treatment is amazing! It only took one night to reduce my giant pimple. It's not harsh and is pretty cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a fast problem solver.
0," Didn't work and can't get money back: I bought this after reading some reviews and liking the price. But it was a waste of money and didn't make any positive difference for my daughter. It actually dried out her face and almost ""burned"" it. She has switched to ProActive and loves it. I was optimistic it would work"
0, Ouch! Don't buy!: I'm 27 and I have had mild acne for ten years. I have tried other products like ProActice
0, I can't believe this got so many good reviews: I bought this book because of the good reviews it received on Amazon and because it was compared to the works of Tom Robbins and Christopher Moore
1, The Perfect Gift is The Perfect Storm: For the serious movie buff or the typical book worm
1, Ripping LPs for my IPod: I got this a couple of weeks back. The s/w installed very easily and despite no documentation it is pretty easy to use. The only catch for me was that on my initial recordings the playback was great but when I replayed the recordings they were terrible. Windows had the Audio recording source as my Webcam and what was recorded was the sound coming out of the speakers being picked up by the Webcam. Once that was corrected via Windows Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio Devices -> Audio tab -> Sound Recording (Default Device) the recordings were great. I haven't even bothered running any filters to take out the hiss yet as it is pretty insignificant.You have to set the input recording level before starting to record but that is a minor setup that will avoid problems later.The turntable itself is simple to set up and use. Not the greatest turntable ever but at the price it is a complete steal.I now get to listen to all my old albums on my IPod and am delighted with the purchase.
1," New turntable 4 Old vinyl!!: This is a GREAT starter table 4 getting my LPs & 12"" vinyl onto CD format!! WAY COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing price & by the time I was talking about this at work - the turntable was already on my doorstep!! VERY FAST & wonderful servive!!"
1, Turntable: This product does exactly what I bought it for. The included software will take you a little time to become proficient
0, Mold and mildew Yuk: This machine was rediculous. It was returned within 3 weeks. It would constantly ask you to clean the milk unit and run the cleaning cycle every day. If you do not
1, A Brilliant
1," The Pinnacle: This is it -- if you are looking for a ""perfect"" 'The Rite of Spring'"
1, needs clothes: My Scene Barbies are prettier and more realistic than regular Barbies or Bratz dolls
1, Nolee is great!: This doll is soooooooo cool. I don't see anything wrong with her. She may be less my style
0," Thalia singing ""You spin me rrrooounddd???: I cant believe she had the nerve to sing this song!!! she doesnt have the style to do so! i feel the same way about her other remakes! [...]!!! Thalia sure is very pretty but lacks so much in talent."
1, Definitely Worth Buying: I'm a major Shakira fan who is trying to branch out into other Latina artists. At first I was hesitant to buy this album because I was never especially captivated by Thalia's earlier albums. This one seems much different though
1, SHE TRULY SURPRISED ME WITH THIS ONE: BEST SONGS:1.YOU SPIN ME ROUN(SHOULD OF BEEN AN ENGLISH SINGLE)2.VUELTAS EN EL AIRE (AWSOME DANCE SONG I JUST LOVE IT)3. A QUIEN LE IMPORTA?

Creo Que No Es Una buena Secuela Para ARRASANDO Claro que Si Tu Escuchas Arrasando Varias veces Termina Por Asquiarte.Buen CD pero le Doy 4 Stars poorque le Falta Nuevos componentes Thalia deberia Reinvertarse Como Paulina En Pau-Latina
1, A binocular for a grandson: These binoculars were a first pair for a grandson. They seem very adequate for him; magnification was fine; pleased with the purchase. It seems far better to spend the money on an actual binoculars as the toy plastic versions cost about the same.
0, Who needs sound anyway?: I bought the DVD with an eye toward using it in a forensic evidence class. Unfortunately
1, CHAMBERLAIN GARAGE DOOR OPENER: AN EASY INSTALLATION
0, Monitor doesn't last long: We loved this monitor until a little over a year after we started using it (of course after warranty expired). The picture got increasingly worse and smaller so that now (two years later)it is a 1/4 inch strip across the monitor. We can only use it for sound now. We are definately purchasing a different brand for the next baby.
0, Poor quality product and customer service: Initially the monitor worked well and then the video portion stopped working. No picture at all. Contacted Safety 1st got the run around for a week and then said it needed to be replaced and that the only way they would do that was to send in the entire system. So now I am without any monitoring system after spending the money for what was supposed to be the best. Bottom line poor quality
0, Run for your Life!: Do Not Waste Your Money on this product!!!! I have bought two of these monitors in a period of 2 and 1/2 years. The product is set up to work just as long as the one year warranty and then a couple months after the warranty is out so is your monitor. This can get expensive if you're buying a monitor every year. I reccomend finding a monitor that is a lot more reliable.
0, WASTE OF MONEY: WE BOUGHT THIS MONITOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING ABLE TO SEE OUR DAUGHTER AND NOT DISTURB HER. WELL THE MONITOR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT TIME AND ONLY AFTER 4 MONTHS OF USAGE
0, Terrible Quality Product: I bought this monitor less than two months ago. The audio monitor has NEVER worked. Since we had another audio monitor
0, SHORT LIVED HAPPINESS: We got this as a shower gift and been using it since our daughter was born (May). We loved the fact that we can see our daughter and not to have run in at every peep. But with each month the picture quality has gotten worse and it seems like its got a life of its own. Its fuzzy
0, Painful to read: cliched and factually wrong: I read this after reading Clifford Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg which is a much better book on the same subject matter. Stoll is just a smart and observant graduate student who simply tries to tell his story accurately. The 2 authors of Masters of Deception are apparently professional writers and they spend too much time trying to liven up what is essentially an account of high school and college kids playing on computers. You get the feeling they writing this with a screenplay in mind. The book is filled with cliches
0, BORING: I thought the book was boring also. Rarely do I quit reading a book. But I could never seem to finish it.
0," joe: cheap junk. these knifes are ""micro serrated"" if you are not using a sawing motion they do not cut. you cant chop because the edge it wont go all the way through. im stuck with them and they suck. i would have never bought them if i knew they had this bogus edge."
0, Didn't know they were serated: I didn't know they were serated knives when I bought them. I wouldn't have
0," This book was a outrage!!!!!!!!!!!!: I read the Legend of Huma hoping that it would follow the guide lines set by the original trilogy. I was sadly dissappointed. It was horrible. What is this with a minataur he did everything. Huma never followed a white stag and never road I quote "" He rode to the high clerist tower where only the dead walked mouthing the names of dragons"" That never happened. It was a total load of junk I am severly dissappointed with your reveiw. But i must give the book some credit. It had a good cover. Never read it it was bad. Stick with Weis and Hickman or try Some Raymond E. Feist"
1, A True Classic: This has got to be the best fantasy novel I have ever read. The character of Huma isn't shown as the epitome of the knighthood
0, Wobble
1, Tai Chi: Great book so far. My only request is if they can make an app to go with the book. I think that would be a nice addition.
0," Dissapointing: As an artist myself I was expecting this book to feature alot more art then was delivered. If you want to read such exiting interview question such as 'What is your favourite food""? Then this book will knock your socks off. For anyone else with a pulse"

0, Died after 6 months: Worked great for about six months. Stopped working last week so I replaced the battery today. Still wouldn't work so I tried another battery and the connector (9 volt style) broke off. Now the whole unit is useless. I'm pretty sure it was dead anyways
0, Duh!: Was this book about an interracial couple
0, Boring: The book was kind of boring. I didn't even finish reading it. I also don't think that it was an interracial book.
1, good game: I got this game for my son
1, Heinerman's Encyclopedia of Fruits/Veg/Herbs: The book was in brand new condition! Very pleased and would buy it again. This is an excellent book. A wealth of knowledge that i've already used several times. I'd highly recommend.
0, Complete Rip Off: Do not waste your money on this product. The shipping weight is described as 2.5lbs. That would indicate multiple products. There was only one tube and it was below five inches in length. I checked the weight on a digital scale. It read 0.35lbs. Most of that weight is packaging. Again
1, AN EXCITING DEBUT!: This book swept me along as if I were riding on a fire truck. The excitement never waned

0," how does it work?: would be very cool and i think smart to show how it might work.i shouldn't complain about its site. i have yet to go to one toreally know if it would work.probably would be a good idea to set up the site by lettingabout 50 ""normal"" people figure out how they should try and buy one. Give each a different remote.i bet their sales would skyrocket. cause nobody else is doing it"
0, Was unable to get universal remote to work with my Sears Garage Door. Settings set properly but no go!!!: Very dissapointed. Could not return item because box was open. How would you know item does not work if you do not open box???!!!!

0, Chuck and Buck: I'm not sure why people find this movie funny. Its not funny

1," Great new show: I'm addicted... I got hooked from the begining just because I wanted to check it out and about halfway through the first season last year I said ""I'm getting the DVD set when it comes out"" and i still watch each episode like it was brand new again!"
1, series hit: I bought this set for my daughter but we spend time watching it together and being able to talk about it after. It is a great series that also helps with the mother/daughter bonding.
0, Great show from the start but not worth buying: I was hooked on this show and the first two seasons were really good. But then the writers went on strike and this show went to trash. It just started to get retarded and boring. The Ending was Stupid and lame. Wish I never started to watch this show as it became a waste of time. I wouldnt even buy the seasons which I Didnt. They have all four seasons in Insant viewing on netflix. Which is where I watched it. If you consider watching it
1, fantastic: Being from England this is brilliant for me
0, Heros the first season: Recieved the DVDs in a prompt time. BUT the DVDs will NOT work in my new DVD. Other DVDs checked at same time did work. Thus leads me too believe the Hero DVDs are defective.
1, Excellent Series: I will start by saying that I am biased -- I liked comic books as a kids
1," What a masterpiece: All I can say is ""WOW""! This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. If you like superheroes"
1, The best way to watch Heroes: Given it's dynamic
1, Excellent reference work: I am finding Morris' commentary extremely helpful. He exegetes problematical Greek
0, Poor Esmeralda: This ballet written by Cesare Pugni in 1844 has regained here a glimpse of life but it is so abridged
1, Murder: Another well written book. It was a very surprise ending and kept your interest throughout. It's amazing that the same event can be written by different people and be so interesting or completely boring. A sad ending but justice served. You never know who your neighbors really are.
0," Save your money: There are some much better quality stories on other short movie DVD's that are available such as ""Watching you"""
0," Crapy plane: This thing sucks the darn thing fell apart in mid air and then busted our neighbours window. Don't waste your money on this i say go with ""air hogs"" there much better."
1, Wonder Bra!: You'll love this trip down memory lane. All three seasons are included here. From the campy 1st season set in Nazi era WW II
1, Great Short-Stories: This one is captivating! These short stories are wonderful
0, Broken: As numerous people of commented
1," The Dead: Review: Great Zombie novel with a different angle. Instead of the usual ""biological / chemical / disease"" outbreak"
1," A must read.: When I first picked up ""The Dead"" I was mainly expecting the normal run of the mill zombie story that I have read many times before but to my pleasant surprize ""The Dead"" is a totally unique and terrifying tale that you surely will not be able to put down.A must read for any fan of macabre."
0, Creative style but ...: I read it on a business trip because that's all I had to read
0, Not His Best: I loved Raney and Walking Across Egypt
1, LOVE IT: My daughter gives it 5 stars! We love the Covenanters. I would only give it 4 only because it could have been better. But
1, Best ever: I Love Susan Wiggs. I've read most of her books. Lakeside Cottage is the best book ever. Could not put it down. Think it should be putinto a movie. Very nice summer story. Loved the characters. Sherry
0," Opinon on Arthritis Mgmt.: I was and am very disappointed in the magazine ""Arthritis Mgmt."" It doesn't seem like it has actual arthritis help suggestions"
0," Visions of Liberal Indoctrination: My soul weeps for the trees that were used to print this steaming pile of dung. I actually cannot believe that I attend a college that would subject their students to this collection of liberal garbage. It is quite evident that the authors of this book have zero actual experience in the field of criminal justice; they are only armchair warriors who believe that their academic vision for the world is the only true way for CJ administrators to conduct themselves. Here is a quote from the ""authors""- not a third party. ""This important text was written by persons who have the needed expertise in those areas that are of major concern to all our citizenry. The future has unfolded"
0, Still Haven't Received Book: 30 days after shipping and 4 emails to the seller later and I still haven't received my book. Wonder if they plan on getting around to it before the semester concludes?
1, The best how to for a great butt!: This book was the best tool for shaping my legs and butt after having a baby!!Trying for baby #2 and will be ready to use all the great info from the book to stay in shape during my pregnancy & after!!
0, What the hell!!!!!: What the hell is this and they call this a double feature they're barely even movies. The first is Ninku the movie the only thing I don't get is if it is the movie what happen to the series
0, crappy: i purchased this dvd thinking that it was the other(and better movie poltergiest report) i had seen poltergiest report before but didnt remember the name anywho this dvd was horribl i am like the BIGGEST fan of yuyuhakusho an i found this offensive to all fans because it sucked it sucked more thatn britteny spears ithe plot was horrible and the animation did not live up to the seriries i was devastated when i watched this movie to any true yuyuhakusho fan i warn u stay away from this dvd i strongly suggest POLTERGIEST REPORT it is an excellent yuyu film
1, Excellent pilates video for beginners and more advanced users: I bought this Pilates DVD without ever having practiced Pilates before. The instructor is very clear about proper posture
1, Challenging But Effective: I was a little surprised at how challening the workouts on the DVD were
0, The disc has technical flaws.: The CD is recorded from cassette tapes. It gives a warning on the back of the CD of this fact (it should give it in the description on Amazon). However
0, Less science
1, Delightful movie: This is a charming B&W movie. The story moves along quickly. We love classic movies. This one is among our favorites. We have watched it quite a lot! Jean arthur is great in this one.
0, Very Slowwwwwwwwwwzzzzzzzz.......: Following John Carpenters very good 'Prince of Darkness' comes this heavy handed political piece called 'They Live'. The movie moves very slowly and the movies descends into the completely ridiculous with his depiction of the homeless. THe fight scene between Keith David and Roddy Piper is memorable only because it runs for about ten excruciatingly boring minutes.Carpenter later admitted that he made this movie in some sort of attempt to attack the Reagan Adminstration. Movie makers should stick to entertainment and keep their juvenile views of politics to themselves. Carpenters movies have been crap since he started to take himself seriously. He should go back to what he's good at.Rent this is you can't sleep. It will cure the worst insomia.
1, I'm gonna try to order this one: If you haven't figured it out
0, Great movie
1, A Very Good Look At John Carpenters Early Movie: I was reading some of the past reviews that I saw for this movie. Most of them were good except for one that stated that the movie went to slow. Well all I can say to that person is that if the movie went to fast then you would have complained that it is to fast. The fact of the matter is that it is a very good movie and I would reccomend it to anybody who wants to see an interesting si-fi movie with a twist.
0, Nice tools but poor quality: I love my pink tools. The only thing is that the name on the handle has dissapeared?? I made spagetti and the spoon got stained with tomatoe sauce. That is why I am very dissapointed
0, Not up par.: Would not recommend this book. It's trite and slow moving. Definitly not up to the Delinsky standard. Most of the time I will buy her books just because her name is on the cover. Wasted my money this time.
1, Romantic Mystery: Coulter does a great job of taking her characters in and out of the mysterious criminal element and the romance. I hope she decides to continue to develope her talents in writing mystery/romance novels.
1, vale la pena: Realmente mas que una vision sobre las mentiras de la iglesia
1, Easy Recipes
0, uninteresting: not my type of magazine. Too upscale and ads were for things well out of my price range. but for 5.00 its something to breeze through looking at. certainly not a magazine i look forward to coming in the mail(unlike my Garden and Gun magazine which I loooovvvveee)
0, Good articles
0, Waste of $$$: Got a year's subscription for only $5 and it was still a waste of money. Pretentious
0, Anticipation exceeds realization: Awaited over 6 months for this book to be published and was let down almost immediately. Almost all but 2 pictures have been published before and the story itself has already been covered by previous bios. Still
1, Last Section Makes It All Worthwhile: I can't disagree that Davis uses conjecture more than would be preferred in a well-researched biography. However - he scores big with his on-the-record accounts from Alain Ronay about what really happened in Paris the week of July 3
1, Simple
1, DVD's would be nice: Since I could not afford the DVD set
1, THE SEDONA METHOD: I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOK. IT HAS BEEN OF GREAT HELP TO ME IN MANY WAYS. PRIMARILY IT HAS HELPED ME GET RID OF SOME NEGATIVE FEELINGS I HAVE BEEN CARRYING AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
0, NOT a USA Product: I have two electronic air pressure gauges that I have no confidence in because they appear to be flimsy and were manufactured in China. I was told by several sources that the line of mechanical gauges from the GH Meiser company are accurate
0, Beware - Made in China: I've had other Accu-Gage tire gages all high quality and made in USA and have been very pleased with them. Now they are made in China and the quality of the materials is typical Chinese junk. Other reviews here say it's made in the USA 
1, Good product: The gauge I'd a good product. What you can't really see from the photo is the air chuck (where the user connects the gage to the tire) is a straight connection
0, Not really my thing: If you're looking for a soundtrack
1," I loved this collection: I loved this collection. It took me back to""what must have been"". What a joy to see Josephine as such a beautiful wife"
1, Fantastic!: It's an very interesting book
1," Too small for grey squirrels: If you are using this to capture the common grey squirrel you should know that this trap is probably not big enough. I ended up purchasing the next size up (model # 1030) which worked great- four stars. The box for this product (#1025) says ""For red and flying squirrels"
0, do not use this trap for transport.: This trap uses gravity to hold the door close. If you transport your animal and the trap tips over
0, big disappointment: Havahart 1025 Live Animal Two-Door Squirrel
0, Too small for squirrels: The trap has a couple of issues.First out of the box
1, Havahart Trap: I bought this trap to control the chipmonks around the house. I bought the trap late in the season
1, Havahart Live Trap: Well built but had to do some minor bending so small squirrels couldn't escape. Good for squirrel/rat. No assembly required. Amazon quick ship. Would recommend.
0, Not for Large Squirrels: The average gray squirrel in my neighborhood is just too big. It says on the box it's for small red squirrels
0, Warning: subtitles cannot be turned off: Zone 1 Francophones beware: the english subtitles are onthe video layer and cannot be turned off. I suppose thismight save the production cost of redoing subtitles forDVD
0, I can't stomach it. Tastes horrible...like vanilla cake batter mixed with melted GI Joes: Looking at the ingredients list
1, Yummy
1, Is It Cake or Is It Pudding?: Blend this with fruit
0, Too hard to get dolls in!: I usually rely heavily on the Amazon reviews before making toy purchases. This time
0, Even if you don't pay
1, A Great Movie!: I started watching Escaflowne when it was on T.V. and after 11 episodes they took it off
0, SACD hybrid surround buyers beware!: fine cd! great music!get the remastered CD version. This is a warning
1, Blow by Blow: If you have heard Jeff Beck's Blow By Blow then you already know. If you have not
1, Fantastic - Full Length & All Music - This Is The One To Own: Great childhood pictures of Karen and her brother. This video is non-stop music combined with photos and videos from the past. Especially for those who heard the Carpenters on the radio day after day
0," ... These are fakes...: Shame on Amazon for letting someone use this ""venue"" for selling poor fakes. You can't buy an *authentic* Vuitton Waltz for this price. Please don't buy this!"
0, Don't waste your money: My husband picked this out and I bought it for his birthday last week. I gave it to him Saturday and it was broke by Wednesday (last night). He was using it in our back yard when the ball went flying off. It came with a replacement ball
0, piece of junk: Broke first time I used it.When it worked it was highly inaccurate (I own a radar speed detector). Save your money.
0, JUNK! BEWARE...: This thing broke during the first use. Even when it did work
1, Decide for yourself: This movie has gotten far too many negative reviews. Yes
0, This movie stinks: An awesome cast of caracters was wasted on this lame movie. The music is the best part of the show. The movie couldn't decide if it was making fun of gangsta flicks
0, Can I go lower than one star?: Unfortunately I was stuck in a hotel room with this being the only movie in English to watch. This movie is extremely insulting to anyone's intelligence. It is not even worth seeing when there is nothing else to do! I actually gave this movie a chance and it really let me down. Wayans and Kudrow are extremely disappointing in this movie that is only a fraction of what it could have been. Maci X
0, REALLY?: You censor a show called CaliFORNICATION? REALLY?!?!? Do you know why people watch the damn show?!?!?! STUPID!
0, Season Wasted: I enjoyed the first two seasons
0, Can Somebody Pass the Cheese...: OK
0, Saw it and I'll pass!!: I was hoping that this 3rd movie would be better than number 2
1, Very nice kitchen table set!!: I was a little nervous about purchasing this kitchen table set. I am so very glad I bought it. It is so sturdy and a really beautiful set! It matches my kitchen perfectly and is a nice size. My boyfriend put it together in about an hour. The chairs take the most time to get together. It was quite heavy upon delivery. The delivery was great....only bad thing is getting an 8 hr time span for the delivery. Plan on sticking around home for an entire day. I give this table 5 stars and really love it!
1, A good mystery novel for young readers: A very quick read
1, Fast Paced: Mr. Roughan
0, Disappointing.: When finish watching this movie I was very disappointed. This movie didn't move me at all. The main character believes (if there were any) are never shown
1, There's a better version: For those who are considering buying this CD
1, Try The Ultimate Blue Train: If you are a John Coltrane or jazz fan
0, NOT A TRUE DVD-A!!!: This is not a true DVD-AUDIO... normally
1, Au Contraire: I totally disagree with the prior review! The DVD-A format does NOT specify that content be Dolby 5.1. It is simply an extremely high bit rate format
1, pretty good: Pretty good tie storage
1, Caution this is so damn good: The perfect cure for self-doubt
0, STAN SMITH TENNIS: I purchased this 2 years ago and returned it.This style pre-dates the dinosaur.No one plays tennis like that anymore.Besides
0, Tennis Shoes: When I ordered the shoes
1, Almost the same...just too small. Order up a 1/2 size???: My hubbie has been wearing Stan Smiths for a looooong time. For a while they were difficult to find. We were delighted to find them on Amazon. HOWEVER
0, Lackluster Performance: If you like Black Uhuru
0, Save your money!: This game is a big waste of money. It is nearly impossible to see the screen. If you like freecell
1, Love this Workout: I bought this video on VHS in 2001 after I had my first child. I was desperate to lose the weight and tone up. I found that after about 2 months of giving this exercise video a try I was in better shape than before I even got pregnant! Every exercise routine reaches a plateau
1, Good but heavy architectural review: This is really a great book for an in depth architetural and archeoligical review of the Vijayanagara site... It does a great job reviewing and descriping some of the pertinent buildings to this study. A little light on pictures
1, This family is fun: I enjoyed it tremendously. Out of the first three in the series this was my favorite. I think it's an individual thing. Each brother in the Carsington family of course has to be a bit different. I was kind of surprised we went from the third brother to the first brother in the series but not at all dismayed. I loved the plot and the setting. The characters were really fun. Bathsheba is quite a character tho' trying not to live up to the family name. The ending is quite funny. That scheming Lord Hargate is turning out to be quite the guy. The scheming daughter and the precocious nephew are quite the team. I loved how this played out and the care and concern you can see between the uncle and nephew. (I ignore the sexual parts. Thankfully not overly graphic but a number of them in each novel.)
0, under gemini: rather naive and boring..it is written well enough .just has not grabbed my interest at all..will sit it aside and give it a second chance later
0, Be cautious: Despite the warnings from other reviewers
0, Disappointed: The original mirrors on my '94 Jeep Wrangler would not stay in place anymore. We had to re-adjust them every time we shut the doors. I spent some time looking for replacement mirrors and found these. I paid $86.72
1, I love Frost!: David Jason rocks! I fell in love with him in Open All Hours
1, Best of British Police Mysteries: Frost is an unpolished Morse who deals with real crime in a mid-sized city.He dislikes authority
1, excellent cd: i never heard of rsj until she came to our local church (but i didn't go see her because
0," somewhat dissapointed: I would say this cd is okay. I'm not a huge fan of hers. I definitely think that she could've taken her skills to a more talented level. She should have taken her talent farther. I totally liked her ""God"" album better."
1, Stunning!: Her albums have consistently improved
0, Embellished: Even though Boren is an experienced writer
1, AmyR: This is a great all-purpose seasoning. It's wonderful on greenbeans that you sautee in garlic and then sprinkle with Aromat! Oh so yummy! This spice is hard to find!
0, How did this make the top-20?: There are only 2 or 3 basic melodies on this album and they just keep repeating in tracks that are just marginally different from one-another. I can only conclude that millions of people(including myself)
1, Easy to read and interesting!: Judaism cannot be reviewed in one book
1, Great Book!: This book provides an accurate basic account of the Jewish faith for all who are interested. It also adds amusing references to pop culture and real-life sitations.
1, first timer: This is my first aquarium and the skilter was recommended to me. It has Been running a month now and I havent had any issues
1, Books I Have Read: The 3 Books I bought I had read over 20 yrs ago...I wanted to re-read them & share w/others...I was surprised that I purchased 2 of them cheaper than when I my original purchase price & were Brand New...One of them was out of print & was listed as very good condition
1," Prime time JB: this is a slamming Live concert by James Brown were He truly gets down. you know His Band is always on point.JB Shifts so well between the Funk&Hwen he does ""It's a Mans World"" he Brings the Pain.a must have&See Performance from the Godfather."
1, A little slow at first but well worth it.: It took a while to set the plot
0, This is being re-released Oct. 17th 2006....: by Warner BBC. They usually can be counted on for a decent transfer. This is an altogether wonderful 5 star film deserving of a DVD transfer better than this version. Here's hoping the new one this October will be it.I've seen the cover art for the Oct 17
1, Collectors and fans are sure getting a boatload of material.: You know
1, Dear Kathy: I had heard Ms Kelly speak in public in my town. Afterward I knew that I wanted to have her words to savor. This book is primarily a diary of many experiences worldwide as a dedicated peacemaker. Her word are supremely convincing to me about the direction my feelings should go even if my body can't do it.
1, Inspirational: I only wish I would have read this book in the begenning of my language studies. It would have helped me overcome some of the barriers of learning a new language sooner. Currently I am fluent in Korean and proficient in German
1, Great inexpensive printer: You just can't beat the price. Plus the fact that it has a tray for the paper is great. NEVER get a printer that is gravity fed. It never fails that eventually
1, A great classic: I saw The Lost Boys when it first came out and then never saw it again till it was on TV. I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to buy the DVD (no commercials). Great movie and my daughter loves Kiefer Sutherland. Has a little bit of everything and I love the soundtrack too. My favorite is Jason Patric. Could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.
1, Forever Young...: I remember watching THE LOST BOYS over and over (on rented VHS!!) back in the summer of 1988. I thought it was the coolest vampire movie I'd ever seen. Well
1," ""Drink and be one of us..."": This is a great vamp flick. It is about a newly divorced mother and her sons who move into Santa Carla"
1," Truely Cheesetastic.: A typical 80's ""cheese"" film. It follows all the guidelines of the 80's comedy-horror genre to the last dot and stands out perfectly. It is one of my all time favorite films"
1, Awesome cast: The lost boys is an action packed
1, Pop Culture Vampire Classic: The perfect '80's vampire film. A great cast who all seem to really understand and love the script
0, I'm still waiting: I am very upset because I still have not received the movie. It has never taken so long to receive any of the product that I have ordered on-line.
1, TV Generation: Another Classic Action Movie from the Master of Disaster Irwin Allen. Too much water has to go somewhere
1, witty
0," Very weak and boring: There are so many better books out on 9|11 and the firefighters response. This one is a mostly boring account of Picciotto's day.His second to second retelling of it is so tedious I could never read more than 20 pages in a sitting.I've read a lot on this subject matter and instead of this check out ""Report from Ground Zero"" and ""Firehouse""."
0," Major Disappointment: Chief Picciotto's favorite word seems to be ""I"" and his favorite topics seem to be his very high opinion of himself coupled with his disdain for higher authority at FDNY and City Hall. Taking nothing away from his personal valor on 9/11"
0, Does not work: This product is completely unreliable. I was told this by a game store before I bought
0, gunk in the cracks: WARNING: do not waste one second of your eyeballs' existence watching POP SKULL. this is no-budget
0, Polar Lights Star Trek Nemesis Scorpion Model Kit ...save your money: This production looks fantastic
1, Supernatural: I enjoyed the show Supernatural on T.V. So this Anime show 
1, A bit different....: This Anime series is very different from the live action version but still touches on key points in the original series. They are able to do alot more action wise as its animation. One thing that bothered me was that JP did all of the episodes as Sam but JA only did two as Dean. The rest of the episodes were split between like two or three other voice actors. Besides that
0," Someone needed pocket money: Wow.. I know some actors make extra cash by doing ""crap-work"" in other countries"
1, Can't beat the price: I bought several packs of these for crafts and it was worth the price. The paper is so big you can cut them if you need too and still have a lot of paper to still work with!
1, strength & grace ~ a must have: Minna is not only a pleasant instructor
1, Very Pleased: I am very pleased with my Enell Bra and the shipping process from the Amazon vendor. When I first put it on the compression seemed a little tight
1, Enell Sports bra: Works very well. Not very stretchy
1, Excellent product: Very solid sports bra from larger sizes. Prompt mailing and product was described perfectly. The material and workmanship are excellent.
1, love it: have to say this is the only sports bra that keeps my watermelons up. It does more than its job. I love this bra a lot
0, Not my favorite sports bra: I was looking for a good sports bra to wear while I work out and found this one through various reviews and was excited to have a bra that had lots of support for larger women particularly during exercise. When I received the bra I took the labels off and put it on. I wore it around the house before going to the gym. I didn't like it mainly for two reasons: 1)when I moved it also made a squeak sound
0, Cruise Control Bonnie: I don't know why I was disappointed with this. Ever since I saw her in 1976 after an explosive opening set by this guy named Tom Waits
0, my perspectiv: the title is very amusing one could say. thats what got me sucked in. i wanted to look at an apolegtic view of archeology and historicity of the bible. unfortunately this dvd does not carry those qualities. very repedative
1, Best product for the price.: Met all my expectations. Best value I was able to find. Only drawback is picture in picture requires an outside tuner. I was not able to get the vcr to serve as tuner.
1, Great film: Christian Bale is perfect for this role. He is genius in this. It couldn't have been better. I cant quite put a genre to this
1, Absolutely Amazing: A film I can watch over and over again and find out new things. Did he really kill 'Paul Allen'? Did he really kill anyone? An amazing film adapted from an excellent novel which I would recommend to everyone. A definate must see.
0, Less Than Zero?: Maybe the reviewers read this one or The Informers and mistook them for American Psycho
0, ....if only i could give it -5 stars or at least 0......: Some movies are meant to entertain
0," BAD DOG FOOD GARBAGE: If this film was meant to be a satire it failed completely. It show us rich people having ""fun"". So my point is: What do we care? When Oliver Stone made ""Natural Born Killers"" people didn't understand the satire because the film was too clever and they were to stupid. Even if ""American Psycho"" is a satire"
0, American Psycho - OVERKILL: 'American Psycho' is about a man who thinks his 'mask of sanity is about to slip'. He has a tendency to go crazy and kill guests at his home. He uses chainsaws
1, Sean Axmaker has no business reviewing movies...: My goodness
0," Is that it?: The only thing good about ""American Psycho"" was Christian Bale's wonderful portrayal of the twisted Patrick Bateman. Otherwise"
1, 55555 stars: This is one of those movies which does not only convey a story
0, Horrible Horrible Movie: This movie was terrible. Barely a plot
1, A good
1, Good Stuff: I wasn't a big fan of Christian music. For one thing
0, anonymous: the tape was advertised as new yet did not work. i really wanted to see this movie because it stars the great vincent price.
0, set things straight: first off this album is not worth 100 bucks. pay no more than 20
0, For women who want to be Stepford Wives: This book was definitely not for me. I would have appreciated some biblical foundations on where some of these opinions of womanhood come from. Then
0, Mormon propoganda garbage!: Teaching women to 'get their way with their man' through manipulative priciples while pretentending to be 'submissive.'
0, The system didn't work in the long haul: I first read this book in my teens
0, GAG! PUKE! MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP!: This book is sickening. If you want to be a doormat and be walked all over the rest of your life
0, Great Movie Bad DVD: This DVD didn't play in my home player at all and barely played in my computer. Apparently Anchor Bay has had some issues with DVD quality. I'd suggest renting it first to make sure it plays in your machine.
1," Number One Cookbook in My Kitchen: I am enjoying two weeks off at Christmas and went ""crusing"" on the net to find recipes for Panetone (festive Italian Christmas Bread) and found this site with the lavish comments and laudatory praises for Carol Field's book. I also found a ""doable"" panetone recipe I could conjure up. After a visit to a local bookstore and finding this ""treasure"" I am hooked! I bought it on Sunday and it's now Thursday and I have read over 100 pages--not only for the tasty recipes"
1, the myth of osteoporosis: The seller worked very hard to make sure that the product was delivered to us. I loved this book the first time I read it
1, The myths of Osteoporosis: I think this is a good book for all woman to read I was only 34 when I found out I had osteoporosis.
1, Great fun at a great price: This game is a spin off of the now out of production Milton Bradley Hot shot basketball. Unlike Hot shot basketball this game isn't electronic. The upside is that it dosent need batterys and it dosent really need to be electronic especially if you have two players. For under 10 bucks this is the coolest game and it folds right up so you can carry it around. I would recommend anyone to buy this game. But if you have a [local store] in your area I would go there first because they carry the same brand for 10 bucks and you wont have to pay shipping. Otherwise buy this baby right now!
1," Beginnings is pre-little River Band.: ""Beginnings"" is an album created from the songs of Little River Band members Beeb Birtles and Graham Goble when the were in the group Mississippi and from Glen Shorrock when he was in the group Axiom.It has some outstanding tracks such as Mississippis's ""Kings Of The World"""
1, Magick Brothers - 'Live At The Witchwood
1," great stuff!!: a fine cd of jumping xmas tunes. The upproar that caused them to pull the version of ""silent night"" was concern about that verse "" round young virgins"
1, 4 Little Girls: This is a must see for any person who truly believes in equal opportunity for all Americans. Set aside any feelings about Spike Lee. This is not his story and nor is it told like it is. This story is the story of the families (and communities) unnecesseary
0, Not happy.: I'm sitting here in Kandahar
0, No difference: I used this for weeks in the middle of summer (the worst time for my oily skin) and could tell no difference in oiliness whatsoever. Disappointed.
1, Quite large and sturdy: These are nice-they are large and pretty sturdy. The interlocking feature for storage is wonderful! The only thing that would make them really prefect is if they could be used int he microwave-but I see they have others than can be.
1, Great for elderly: I bought these for my father who loves his fresh corn. At 74 years his hands are giving him trouble and the large grips are perfect. They stay in the dishwasher baskets and the prongs slide into each other to prevent getting stabbed by them when stored in the drawer.
1, Good Read: This book was not better then the first book in the series but definately beter then the 2nd one. I found the story boring at time as some issues that were already discussed in the fist book where discussed again in the 3rd book. Other then that it was a good continuation.
1, Princess Sultana is a true heroin!: I had read all three of the Princess books
0," Disappointing: Having read the other two ""Princess"" books"
0, Full of lies...: When you do not come from an Arabic country
1, Review of Adam and Eve: The book was very interesting. I had never given much thought to what they did after leaving the Garden of Eden. This book fills in a lot of the blanks.
0, This Studio: A2ZCDS
0, Ouch!: I like Cary Grant
0, This screen gem deserves better: I am in love with film. The Ben Hecht script is priceless
0," Bad transfer ruins good movie: This transfer suffers from the same problems reported by other Amazon shoppers for the D3K edition of ""Charade"". It seems like D3K masters their discs from broadcasts by Encore or AMC. Unless you've got to have it"
0, Ramblin' Rose: I did not enjoy watching this DVD
1, Cary Grant at his best: For those that have never seen a Cary Grant movie
1, Rosalind Russell Rules: Cary Grant is great in HIS GIRL FRIDAY--Cary Grant was great in everything he ever did--but it is Rosalind Russell who makes this film for me. She was an atypical film actress for her day
1, Saving the Jews - Great Book!: This book is fascinating
1, Bought two of these curling irons in one week.: This curling iron is great because of the 5/8 barrel.Its perfect for fine medium length hair.Why this size is so hard to find is beyond me....Helen of Troy makes the best curling iron have replaced most of mine with Helen of Troy..Received the product quickly and will re-order in the near future for other beauty products.
0, poorly made earrings: the earrings were cheaply made and were not the same size. One was smaller than the other...the earrings were returned.....
1, The truth of the Faith: This is the book that convinced me of the truth of Catholicism and convinced me to convert from Anglicanism. While Keating does get bogged down quite a bit in responding to and shooting down fundamentalists
0, Miss advertised: This item is advertised as a DVD however
0, Warning - DVD does not play in computers: I saw this movie a long time ago and liked it. Unfortunately
1, Honoring Charlie Parker: This is a fantastic movie with lots of special features. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of Forest Whitaker as an actor
1, GREAT NEW ORLEANS R&R: Bobby Marchan was a true original
1, Airplane Enthusiasts will love: My little guy loves everything airplanes
1, ...another third-generation classic...: For myself
1, Best Tull album ever!!!: This is probably my favorite Tull album. Another fantastic mix of acoustic folk music sounds and hard rock. My favorite songs here are Moths
0, Pretentious drivel: Dum-de dah-dee dah dah ...... Totally absent from this heap of mediocrity . As exciting as a slow release of gas under one's seat . And about as meaningful .
1," Jimmy Wilson's ""Future History"": With Future History"
0, The title says it all.: This is certainly a very stupid movie. I really don't see why anyone ever bought this script! First of all
1, Spiderman is good
1, Great value
1, Navigator: Ive seen some expensive Gps
1, Good buy.: For the price I got this for
0, Think twice before making this purchase: I recently purchased this product which I am very dissatisfied with. I called technical support since the device could not find maps so the technician decided I should install the software to find out that the software is not supported by Macintosh computers. Not to mention I was on hold for over an hour and found technical support to be very rude and unsuccessful. His solution to the problem was it's a new product it just came out. So basically I have a device that I can't use. I hope you find this review helpful because I don't want anyone to go through what I did.
1, Fast paced
0, I never received this product from Amazon: I never received this product from Amazon. Amazon ignored my e-mail telling them that I did not receive this product. Apparently there is no accountability of who received this product at my address. I now purchase this product from another company even though I am an amazon affiliate with their products on a number of websites.
0, Not enough vibration: This was not worth the money spent. I think if it was a more high powered it would be a lot more satisfying. I bought this for my partner and I and neither one of us really enjoyed it.
0, Not A Good Purchase: Only one half of the product worked the first time we tried it. It was also very cheaply made and loud. I called the company
0, Armalaser cant stay put on Glock 17: Mounted according to specs this aiming device will not keep accurate placement on a Glock 17. The front of the device has no mounting hardware. It depends soley on the trigger guard to support it from the rear
0, horrible quality: Horrible video quality...almost non watchable. Story is fine but the quality of the video leaves alot to be desired. We were barely able to watch it because of the video quality.
0, Talk about a Bad Concept: This product would have been better if they would have created their templates built over existing MS Office programs
1, good but could be more mathematical: I like this book 'bout being very concise and detailed about the various synthesis processes
0, Technical: Not exactly what I was searching for.Definitions
1, This really is the canine's privates: I bought this book when I first started on my Music Technology degree... I'm now just finishing my final year project
0, Hmm
1, Crazy Jackie: You probably have guessed that I am not that young since I enjoy Jackie Mason.My husband and I laughed a lot with this video.You have to like him to enjoy his type comedy.My husband always likes him but I tend to cringe a little with some of his lines.I have to say that I haven't watched the video at all since the first time....who knows; I may have outgrown him.
1, The Messenger by Jim Salestrom: Very joyful
0, A monument to political correctness!: I come to this book late--ten years after it was written. Looking at the other reviews
0, annoying voice of Dexter Gordon.: Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie. The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow. I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it. Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10. With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius
1, Round Midnight: The story moves slowly
1, One of the most bizarrely funny books you will ever read.: Harmon Nails
0, I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or ...: I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family. The taste
1, What a great surprise these bars were! I'm ...: What a great surprise these bars were! I'm a hiker and have used other brands of energy bars -- most of which do the trick but taste like sawdust. The Balance Bar is moist and tasty with the added bonus of a yogurt coating. I had one for breakfast and it lasted me well into lunch with no hunger cravings. I love that they are nutritionally balanced and I will certainly take them along on my next hiking trip.
1, I thought this product was great because it ...: I thought this product was great because it tasted good and the nutritional value is very high. I would really recommend this product to others -- especially those who may be in a program like Weight Watchers. I am in the Weight Watchers program and this brownie is only a 6-point item in the program. So it's wonderful to use as a snack. It tastes just like a regular brownie with nuts in it. I heated them up to enjoy them even more
0, Not-fresh: I bought Yogurt-Honey-Peanut bars from DAB. What I received was not fresh
0, I suppose if you're just looking for fuel ...: I suppose if you're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk
1," Always go back to these: I've tried A LOT of different bars over the years. Many serve a specific function like ""high protein"" for after resistance training or ""150 calories or less"" for a light snack. In the general"
0," unnecessary cruelty: People sometimes ask me ""Why do you care so much about Hollyoaks?"". My reply to them is always passionate ""..because it is the most god-awful"
1, A thrill a minute: Casper Van Dien does a perfect shallow journalist who matures a little. Catherine Bell does a wonderful job as the eternal research assistant who gets really involved with the investigation. Theresa Saldana does a wonderful job as the self-involved expedience agent.
1, Incisive Scholarship!...and Taverns!: This is a terrifically written study

1, Beautiful Women and Well Staged Killings: Tenebre is the kind of movie that will keep you guessing until the very end.The killings are done with style and gore and unlike the horror movies of today
0, review: received item in a timely matter
0," Leave This One For The ""Yard"" Birds: Despite the poor sound quality"
0, excellent: This CD has become a Christmas tradition at our house. We always put up our tree and listen to this CD. I have the album
1, HIM so good to be true: I read the reviws and I see that most of you liked 'Join me in death'(HIM)! I have to say that I only bought this CD because of it
1, Modern Combo and Very Good Trombone and Sax: The style here is modern post-bop
1, A can opener that is a cut above the rest: The Zyliss Safe Edge Can Opener is a tremendous improvement over the traditional can opener. Tradititional can openers often fail to complete the full 360 degree cut; forcing the user to bend the sharp edged disk back and forth before it finally breaks free. Even when the disk is broken free
0, Awesomely gruesome but trashy.: Movie lacks direction & plot and attention is focused on these bloodthirsting freaks. Script is poor & dumb. Pop Rock Soundtrack is mindless and totally incohesive with the movie. But bravo for the visual transformation on these monsters.
0, Why was the movie dubbed?: This movie was a real let down. The characters were not even talking themselves. It looked tacky and unprofessional. I have to admit the gore was pretty foul. Made me feel a bid queasy. But apart from that it was ruined by the fact that it was dubbed. Good story though!
0, Crummy re-recordings: These aren't the recordings you remember and they just doesn't have the punch. Very weak.
0, Not any good...: I could only read an hour and a half of this poorly written outline. Read
0, Awful: I agree with the person who wouldn't recommend this toanybody. I watched it out of curiosity
1," When Real Love Comes Along: I loved this movie because it showed that anyone know matter of age or social status can find ""Real Love."" Eventhough time was a issue just the brief time together caused a lifetime change in the heart."
0, By-The-Numbers Load of Blech!: This movie is nothing but a cliched creepfest whose laughable storyline consists of Richard Gere pining after some young girl. If the plot doesn't creep the heck out of you
0, Where is the chemistry?: This is one of those films where everything is perfect and it still doesn't matter. The film is visually beautiful and Gere and Ryder give polished performances. Only one problem
0, Probably Out Of Date!: * I'm not much of a fan in stock market but I believe the theory given inside this book is out of date.* With the expensive price for this book
0, I lost BIG using this system: Since July of last year I have lost over $52
0, What a Joke!: This book is being hyped by the publisher with positive reviews. The only believable reviews are by the ones who have lost money! I have made my money in the stock and futures markets over the last fifteen years and I have NEVER seen a book that adds so much risk to the investing process. I know many professional traders and some have read this book. Not one of them would dare to risk their hard earned money on the pipe dream that this book pushes. The markets just aren't that simple. If you think you're going to read this book
0, A real sleeper: I ordered this book through the Ken Roberts Company and made an easy decision to send it back. To me
0, Worst book on investing ever written: All the positive reviews of this book have the air of greenhorns or promoters. I have read this book and it greatly oversimplifies the process of investing to the point where I found myself laughing outloud. A stock going sideways for many months or years means absolutely NOTHING! Sideways action has a %50 chance of being accumlation or distribution by the professionals/insiders. Check out the bases for these stocks: Boston Chicken and Bre-X. They were perfect setups according to Ted's plan. Wanna know where they are now? How about zero

0, A Widow's Walk: You call it a Memoir
1, An unbelievably touching book: I originally bought this book for the sole reason that Marian and i were childhood friends who grew up on the same street together in Staten Island. I knew of Dave's death shortly after 9/11 and kept Marian and her family in my thoughts daily.I knew Marian was gifted but was totally unprepared for how much this book would touch me and change my life. I now view the people i love in a different way.Her book was beautiful and so well written. I felt like i can somewhat understand what all of these brave people went through both firefighters and their families

1, Great Christmas Addition!: This is a really fun & jazzy cd. It's perfect background music for parties or just sitting by the fire. His rendition of Rudolph is now my 7 year old's favorite & he does a fabulous version of Let it Snow. Great CD!!
0, What a disappointment: As a huge fan of Steve Tyrell's other two albums
1, Practice makes perfect: Sometimes
0, Short Life + Poor Performance = Bad Value: I bought this as a desktop PC backup.A year after installing it
0, Short Life: I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge. It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life. Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all. Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning. I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time.
0, Arakis ain't the middle east: I rented this because I am such an avid fan of Dune
1, Great miniseries: Let's be clear. This is not the movie ! Hence
0, Utter trash: The only things worse than the acting were the laughable costumes. Special effects are pathetic. If you're really curious
0, Ruining a classic: Though this version of Dune was more towards the book in many ways
0, UGH!: I bought this DVD in mid June
1, Intelligent science fiction!: Yes
0, Lacking: Being a big fan of Dune I was eager to see the series. I was however very dissapointed with the style
1, An excellent adaptation: I know what you might think- that this was a film made for TV
1, Good Sci Fi: I like this movie. Sticks to the book pretty much. One thing that I noticed that they left out was the name that Paul chose. Sure the movie only kept Muad d'ib
0, Watch how you order: The AL8 had been 'repackaged' and the instructions and owner's manual in the box were for a Sony BluRay DVD player (useful
0, Too much rambling and disjointed: The book never clearly told a continuos story
1, My 3 year old loves this movie.: My son is always asking for me to out this on
0, Guy Manos should die: Worst movie ive seen in a while. About as bad as Demolition Man
0, very poor quality: Apparently
0, Less then okay of a flash light: I was wanting a good small flash light I can use when working on my car
0, Quit working Thanks: After 8 months and a return not available it stopped working / garbage. Worked great the first 8 months then nothing. Bill
1, Duty use: This holder is great to have on your belt! You never know when you might have to have your maglite with ya!!!
1, SUPERB LITTLE WONDER: IT'S AN AMAZING FLASHLIGHT FOR THE SIZE. IT HAS THE LITE INTENSITY OF A ORDINARY TWIN D-CELL FASHLIGHT AND WILL LAST EVEN LONGER. THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE BEAM IS FANTASTIC AND IT'S SMALL SIZE MEANS I CAN CARRY IT WITH ME CONSTANTLY. HIGH QUALITY AND VALUE FOR THE BUCK ARE IT'S BEST POINTS.
1, Mag SP2201H 2-AA Cell LED: Maglite has made some welcome updates in their mini flashlight. This is a great LED flashlight for $18 including the batteries. Very bright for the price and Maglite's great build.
0," This album should not get any mics or stars!!!: Back in the day we all once knew of a cat around the way straight out of NYC called Nas who dropped some of the illest rhymes and beats when he came out with albums ""Illmatic"" and ""It was Written"".Nas also dropped some of the illest guest appearances in many other artists albums that I have ever heard but like the saying goes ""What goes up must come down"".Nas was at the top for the longest time but as time went on he started putting less work into to his albums which isn't hard to tell which is why he is soon to fall off.On this album his has maybe at the most 4 tight songs but those songs don't even touch some of his best ones he had earlier in the years before..If your a Nas fan you gotta wonder how much more trash is he going to put out.."
1, well done cd!!!!!!: If you are a NaS fan you will love this cd!! This cd has many great songs
0, Oh Nas :(: How the mighty have fallen. What a weak
0, remember when hip hop was synonymous with TRUE expression?: there once existed an emcee who had the ability to paint landscapes of haunting beauty.....told stories so detailed that you could literally invision yourself in the same position or situation....acquired the privileged ability to flow like hot descending pop corn butter into an empty bag....this emcee could battle any other contender out there....now
0, laughable: Word to Nas--you are not Tupac. You are not an artist. You are not a poet. You are a prententious fool. For substantial
1, The King has Finally been Crowned: After Listening to So many Other Artists spout their crap
0, Ummm . . . No.: i don't know what happened. this cd is horrible. he never had a nice flow. i used to give him credit for his creativity but thats long gone apparently. as far as his beats
1, Nas gives us a lesson...: on how to be a REAL mc. Songs like Book of Rhymes and Made You Look are instant classics!! He traded his pink suit and large chain from his Nastradamus days
0, NaS bombs dis one: Unfortuantly nas bombs this one compared to his last cd stillmatic
1, Blends the best of suspense and romance!: As a fan of the author's
1, Wonderful Series: Nora Roberts (writing as J. D. Robb) has written a great series with the In Death books. This is the first of the series and is absolutely wonderful. I have alrady listened to or read all of this series that has been published but am purchasing them on CD now so I can listen to them again. You will love the characters that are in all of these books. Eve Dallas is a police office who is very dedicated to her job
0, Awful: I asked a friend for recommendations for a mindless beach read
0, Good premise
1, First time reading this series: I was impressed. I liked the futurist world Roberts created. The new technology and moral beliefs of the public was basically plausible. The protagonist
1, Back To The Beginning: This was the first in the series. i have read later books and wanted to go back to where they started. Just getting started on a delighted series. Even out of order
1," Naked in Death: I've read many of Nora Roberts other books but had never gotten around to starting the ""in Death"" series. As soon as I picked it up I was hooked. I love the switch on focus from romance to mystery. Besides the great story line the details of how the future has a lot of the same problems we have today were great. The point where Eve Dallas' Autochef burnt her toast was a high point for me. I really enjoyed the chracter of Eve Dallas because it's not often you read of female cops and her constant professional attitude was great. Would recomend this series to any Nora Roberts fans."
1, The first of a FANTASTIC series: This is a re-release ... but don't let that stop you. This is a fantastic series. If you haven't started reading the series
0, Naked in Death: The characters have potential
1, borrowing from animal house: Concerning the movie Road Trip
0," HATEABLE: ""Road Trip"" was almost as bad of a movie as ""Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind""!!! There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this tripe. This movie was crap. It is just so stupid. There's too much wasted nudity"
1, Road Trip (Dvd Edition): Excellent movie: all actors plays an incredible succesfull game
0, SHUTTER ...NEEDS TO GET SHUT DOWN!!!!!: I was very
1, Just as he described: Ithe iphone was in perfect conditions just as he described; I got it in a short time and when I contacted the seller he was nice and decent... Was a great deal!
0," not his best work...: If you're looking for ""Abraxas"" type fireworks"
1, What I wanted: I didn't care much for any other track on the CD
0, By far the worst movie ever made.: Snow day appauled me. It physically hurt me to watch this movie. What made this movie so bad?? EVERYTHING. All this movie consists of is the assault of a harmless snowplow man and weather reporter. I never even wanted to see this movie
1, its an okay movie: well i saw this movie a long time ago and i dont remember laughing at any parts of the movie i only remember watching small parts of the movie and i kind of liked this movie this movie i belive only has action but no comedy its not the greatest movie ever but its not bad eaither just give this movie a try!!!
1, Fantastic Winter Blues movie: Great movie to watch when you have a case of the Winter Blues. This movie is fun for all ages. Best to watch on a cold winter day under the covers with a nice hot cup of hot chocolate. Also reminds me that it's nice every now and again to stay in when the weather is bad and just have some good quality time with your family and friends or even by yourself.
0, Funny narrating
1," Nothing but Excellent: I loved Mistress because it portrays the ""behind the scenes"" of what producing a movie is truly about. I loved Sheryl Lee Ralph in this movie because it portrays what just be me going on in our movie industry. Sheryl is an excellent actress and need to be seen in more excellent movies. Excellent producing/directing on DeNiro's part."
1, SO much better than Sony's DSC-T1: I bought this camera after much research. It is superior to its Sony counterpart T-1 in almost every way:+It is about 50 g lighter than the T-1
1, good for the price: My husband loves Maglite
1, Talk about your pieces of crap!: This is a funny book about the worst moments in professional wrestling. It is a spinoff of the website of the same name. The main difference between the two is that on the website individual crap is looked at
0, Mostly boring.: I guess if you're one of those lucky people who has more money and time than they know what to do with
0, Where are my magazines?: I bought my subscription on amazon for W on the first of january and since have recieved one issue
0, Average View of European Countries: There are some really breathtaking scenes in Sweden
1, THIS IS THE BEST PIANO CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!: Wow
1, I love it!: Very beautifull!! Two collors
1, Mine was so good
1, Mag-Lite Outshines the competition: Mag Instrument's lighting products are of high quality in all aspects of the products' construction and function. The body of the lights are strong and durable. The interior workings last for years without fatigue that is found in most other flashlights. Fatigue in the springs and contacts cause intermittent light and eventually failure. Not so with Mag products. The switch is high quality and durable and offers many years of dependable use. The relflector and beam adjustment feature work well together and offer a wide range of beam dispersal. Mag flashlights are worth every penny and will continue to function for many years.
0, Purple Mag 2-D Flashlight: I was extremely dissapointed because I ordered a purple Mag 2-D flashlight and you sent me a blue one. I still want a purple one if you have any of them. I sent the blue one back and I think you credited my credit card. I still want a purple 2-D flashlight and would appreciate your contacting me if it is available. The internet said that it was.I also ordered a purple Mag 3-D and I received it and I love it!!! It is totally awesome!!!! Took it on vacation with me in the van and it came in handy more than once!!!! Thank You~!! Thank You!!! Thank You!!!Janet J. Southards
1, Clinometer: Was a gift for my husband - per his request (smile). He seems to love it so I guess that's all the review one needs!

1, Worth buying: My best album of 2001. Great melody
1, Dan Diveley: This is the best b2b branding book that I have read. Unlike other branding experts
0, Needless Rants Spoil This Novel: Needless and unfair rants against Pro-Lifers spoil this novel about two sisters in the Southwest. In several places in the novel Ms. Hall treats the reader to Pro-Life bashing of an extreme and one-sidded nature. These rants don't further the plot
0, Pick a note...: Paige puts in an average effort in the British follow up to the 1987 New York production with Patti LuPone (who fits the role almost perfectly). Chorus work slightly shaky. Paige's accent is hilarious. Pick a note Elaine!
0, Tinpot Sound quality: This CD sounds like its been recorded from a cheap seventies walkman. The recording sucks so bad
1, Not easily improved upon!: I bought a MagLite solitaire and a 2 D-cell (both black) for my dorm room in college
0, Maglite needs to go LED: Replaced all my mini-mag and large mag lights with Fenix and Pelican LED lights. Mags are behind the curve. The difference is amazing when you compare a Fenix 1 AAA cell light against a mini mag. You may as well not have a light if you are using the mini mag.
0, the dial sticks beware: This toaster oven is a piece of crap. At first it was ok
0, Terrible Toaster Oven~ way too big & died in less than 6 months!!: This is a VERY large toaster oven
0, This Oven Is Not As Good As My Old One Was: My other oven element burned out after about 6 years of daily (and sometimes 2 or 3 times a day) use. I loved the oven
0, possible false advertising?: YOU LISTED THE TO600 TOASTEROVEN AS HAVING 2 RACKS/BROIL PAN
1, MARÍA CALLAS: I love opera. One day I was in my car listening to a Maria Callas cd and my 5 year old granddaughter was with me; she was so impressed that she asked me if I had a DVD of Maria Callas. So ofcourse I went to Amazon and got it.. Both my grandchild and I loved it.
1, superfluous: Zippo at its finest
0, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!: The movie is great and the original DVD was
0, crappy: You should check the staplers before they are shipped-one of the staplers was received broke-which will inturn influence my decision to purchae in the future.
1, Great Music: I really enjoy this Tim McGraw cd. It came in great shape
1, they dont belong to the attic!!: this is THE BILLY JOEL LIVE RECORD!!
1, My favorite Billy Joel album: There's only one Billy Joel. This guy is an American legend
1, Wonderful Songs: Don Williams is the best! And the songs on this are just great. I hope you like it as much as I do. His voice is just smooth and hearfelt.
1, Best of the '65 - '68 quintet albums: If you only buy one of the studio recordings of this band (Miles
0, Pierre Bensusan in Concert: Pierre Bensusan in ConcertI purchased the DVD on the 5 star recommendation listed and was disappointed. Pierre Bensusan is a good finger picker but is by no means a great one. If you want to hear a good picker purchase one of Tommy Emanuel's concert DVDs.
0, Oh
0, Poor Writing: When I read the introduction of this book at the bookshop I was quite impressed and I thought I would get more from the rest of the chapters. However when I bought the book and proceeded to the later chapters I was dissappointed.The advice that he gives are sometimes specific to himself and would not suit to other people. As he admits in the book
0, Oh
1, Billy Joel is Great: I absolutely love Billy Joel. From the first day when I heard Billy Joel playing on the radio
0, Too little mystery and too much explicit sexual description: Highly recommended
0, Real fiction: Seems that James Patterson has taken a turn
0, two thumbs down: I'm probably not as qualified to judge this book as the other reviewers
1, kelly artigas: very good product and the timely arrival original recommend everyone buy the product to enjoy a good piece to wear thanks greetings
1, I love it: The pink color shows up differently on my monitor and I was a little concerned after I received it in the mail.I ended up loving the watch. It has gotten a compliment
1, Solid Solution: I bought this after I started to feel guilty for leaving my butts on the ground. The construction's pretty solid and I like the fact that it snaps closed. The latching method is a bit of an oddity as the spring isn't actually a spring; more like a bent metal strip on the locking side. It was a bit of a struggle to empty it on my first attempt as it takes a bit of leverage against the sliding piece to accomplish. After a few times it's become second nature and emptying is much easier. The case sometimes emits a slight odor when full
1, Zippo Pocket Ashtray: I have bought several pocket ashtrays for different reasons (1 looks like a dice). This has to be the best one. You can fit about 3 butts in it (4 if you squish it in) and the others seem to be smaller. Just put the butt in and close it! Put it back in your pocket or purse and empty it next time you can. I would recommend this one over the rest. Zippo makes good products!
0, Beagle Review: I have a beagle
1, Analog as its best....: The Ted Jensen remaster or the Sony Mastersound (out-of-print) are bright and compressed. I was curious
1, One of JOEL's BEST !: Not much to say but this is one of the better efforts from a MUSICAL GENIUS. One has only to look at the playlist on this CD to understand the impact this CD played on music during the last two decades.
0, Pass on this one.: This is more of a transitional record and it left me wanting more substance. I found most of the material to be forgettable. Sorry for all of you fans of 'electric Miles' (I like some of it too -In A Silent Way for example)
0, Oh boy what a boring record.: This is easily one of Miles' least essential efforts. It's clear that he was in a transitional state (his backing group was splintering during these lazy sessions) and the music is just stoned noodling
1, Nice
1, As advertised: Works fine. Definitely water proof. Provides extra padding in my laptop bag. My only question is: Did I really need this? I don't know. I thought I was going to be out in the rain more - if you're not you don't need it; if you are... I don't know a trash bag would have been just as good since it's in a waterproof laptop bag already (purchased separately). Maybe too much of a luxury item?
0, What a joke!: Same problems as all the others. The rods were not the same length or width
1, SPEAKS VOLUMES: This riveting story speaks volumes to everyone
1, LILLA BELLE'S BEAUTIFUL!: Lilla Belle is a very beautiful little girl
1, LILLA BELLE'S OUR WONDERGIRL!!!: I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK! LILLA BELLE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL

It's also a teacher for the ages!This book should be in every home in the world! Gorgeous little girl on the cover too! I have already purchased several books to give as birthday presents! I AM SPREADING THE NEWS TOO! LILLA BELLE IS DEFINITELY NEWS WE CAN ALL USE!!! AND IT'S A BOOK THAT WILL NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE! LILLA BELLE IS A TRUE CLASSIC! WE HERE IN STAR CITY
1, WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS!: As an elementary teacher
0," Bleek needs to stop!: Rocafella has truly fell off. I've never really been a Bleek fan but this has to be Bleek's worst album. I did not think he can do worse than MADE but it looks like I was wrong! NEwayz if I were you i wouldn't even take my time to listen to the album if it weren't for one song ""Dear Summer"" and Bleeks not even on it just Hov."
0, What a waste of good money: I bought this album back in the summer thinking it'd probaly be a hot ablum because

0, Not for me: I was disappointed in this book. I missed in the description that the author uses anecdotes about other children. I don't care for books that are written that way. I don't want stories of others and this book is full of them. I just want straight foward common sense advice. Read descriptions of books very carefully before purchasing.
1, Wonderful Gift for My Husband: My husband is a weekend painter so I really wanted him to have a easel that was easy to use
1, For the artist: Great easel for painting or drawing. It has draws for storing paint and brushes and is very sturdy. My daughter loves it!
0, Love Johnson? Keep looking: A good source for minute information
0, Couldn't even finish it: I read the back of this book
1, It's Sonic Brilliance!: This is probably Miles Davis' most underrated album
1, Solid tool!: We use these tools for a commercial cabinet company and find them to have plenty of power and are durable.
0, Not very good: Sound quality was very dissapointing. Sounded tinny with a fair amount of interference even when only a few meters from the main unit. And that is in a house with no wireless phones or internet. I doubt I'm ever going to use it.
1, The Best of Vonnegut.: This book is by far one of his best. As one of Vonnegut's biggest fans
0," I don't understand the hype: I am a lukewarm Vonnegut fan. There are some of his books I enjoy (though there has never been one that I've ""loved"") and some that bore me to death. This one was OK for the 1st half. Though a bit tedious"
1, My kids love this series: Its very funny and entertaining. I sometimes catch myself watching it with my kids. The Characters are very cute.
1, Perfect: I have a Honda Mower... Spark Plug fits great and the mower purrs like a cat. Torqued the spark plug to 18 ft-lb with a torque wrench. Didn't specify that with the spark plug or the mower manual
1, High Quality Spark Plug: This is an outstanding quality
0, Hated it: This was a nothing single I hated it and so did everyone else a stupid cover everyone was asking if she was A Lesbo this is possibly her worst single of all timeLyrics -1/10 Production 0/10 Overall 0/10
0, Awful: This film had the foulest language I have ever heard
0, Hmmm.: I'll admit that I was entertained
1, It's so cheap
1, You should use it: I recently blacked out my grill/tailgate badges and hubcap centers after reading about doing so on several on-line forums. What I learned was that everyone that did not use an adhesion promoter had chipping
0, poorly written with annoying characters: The writers of this show must be moonlighting from their regular jobs on a soap opera. The characters are so poorly developed they make the Real Housevives seem deep in comparision. The stories are cardboard and the 'science' is about as believable as an episode of The Jetsons. Truly awful and getting worse each season.
1," YOUR FAVORITE SHOW STILL THE BEST!: WELCOME BACK BONES FANS! BRENNAN AND BOOTH ARE IN THE FAMILY WAY! HODGINS AND ANGELA SHOW OFF THEIR BABY.IT'S LIKE BEING WELCOMED BACK TO THE JEFFERSONIAN AFTER BEING ON VACATION! SHARE THE FUN WITH BEST FORENSICCRIME SOLVING TEAM EVER. PREPARE TO CRACK UP WHEN BRENNAN STARTS TO PRACTICE ""BABY TALK""! MORE GREAT ANDGROSS CASES MAKE THE 6TH SEASON A MUST HAVE FOR BONES FANS. IF YOU HAVEN'T DISCOVERED THIS SHOW YET"
1, Love Love Love this series!: This is a great series and it is so much better on DVD than on TV! I hate commercials and it great to be able to just pop in a disc and relax on the sofa.
1, Great Season of Bones: Bones is got to be one of the best primetime shows out there right now. This season was just as good as the past 5
1, Bones Sixth Season: Nothing is better on a snow day than watching Bones and Booth banter back and forth. Bring on the snow.
0, NB: By comparison: Domingo's attempts at baritone roles is successful only because
0, The worst vocal disaster ever: I dont know why anybody has not told Plàcido what a disastrous role he is playing as a baritone in the autum of his career
1, A beautiful historic portrait through the life of a boy and father: Lovely way to show the history of a country at a certain period through the eventful life of Tanios and his father. Their daily issues
1, Works As Expected: My backpack blower was becoming listless so I decided a tuneup was in order. I tried to purchase this spark plug locally but was unsuccessful in doing so. As usual
1, After reading this book
0, Not useful at all!: These CD's are nothing more than someone reading the lectures in the Textbook and the Workbook
1, This C.D has very interesting songs.: This C.D has songs that other singers sing in as well as Billy Joel
1, Charming Guy Buffet Dessert Plates: I received a set of four of these plates as a gift and I cannot wait to buy a second set. They are of excellent quality and if you have not seen them in person before you will be delighted by the detail of each picture. Also
1, Great Watch!!!: This watch is even better than I had hoped for!! It's just the right size
1, I finally got my son to sit down!: My son is two and he loves this video. We had trouble getting him to sit and watch anything on tv. He would only sit for the first five minutes of blue's clues and sit for nothing else. I got him a few tractor videos and now he wants to watch them all the time. It really helps because I also have a 6 month old. I could never get anything done until I purchased this video.
1, Kids loved it!: Bought this during an Amazon sale on a whim to save for a future birthday party. Did not expect it to be so nice! Comes with a DVD and lights up and makes sound. Was the hit of the party when the 5 year old boy opened up his gifts. Other kids kept trying it out and wanting to play with it. Wish I had bought another!
1, THE FORSAKEN: THE FORSAKEN is a horror/action thriller about a guy named Sean who is driving cross-country to attend his sister's wedding
0, Contemporary Vampire Hunter: Sean
1, Great Fun!: The Code Book is so much fun
1, Makes it all clear: I enjoyed reading this book. It is informative and entertaining
1, Reader-friendly writing about codes and ciphers?: Yes. Singh again accomplishes his self-set task of opening and making intelligible a world most find at best ponderous and at worst impenetrable. His brief history of encryption methods and means of penetration of the same is both easily read and satisfying for those at almost any level. (If you think you're too knowledgeable about the subject
1, Very interesting book: This book starts slowly but gets better and better as it goes along. Very complicated subjects are presented clearly. I finally know what the RSA conferences are about here in Silicon Valley (and I finally know what RSA means). The RSA algorithm is neat and I am determined to hack it (fat chance). Gotta be a way...And now I understand great uses for the modulus. Yep
1, A book you can read: I ordered this book
1, Fun Read: Great Book! A fun read and very interesting. A history of code making and code breaking from the beginning until now.
1," Just a kick ass Billy Joel album: You would think without any real radio hits except for maybe ""The Entertainer"""
1," Fine Early Billy Joel: ""Streetlight Serenade"" is a fine album by pop music standards"
1, The last Hitchcock `s farewell!: Truffaut really looked outstanding with this somber psychological study of the human soul
0, Review: This movie wasn't even scarey. The title & description were misleading
1, Lots of information
1, Ready to Rumble: This was a Christmas present for my brother. The month or so leading up to Christmas we had started quoting the movie and talked about how the movie was so corny it was kinda good. The funny part of the whole thing is that on Christmas morning we almost opened up a present from each other at the exact same time to reveal that we both had the same idea. I bought him this copy and he bought me a copy.
0, ready to rumble: Ready to Rumble is the dumbest act of uncivilized humor since Dumb and Dumber. It's alright but I wouldn't buy it I'd record it. The plot is 2 Jimmy the King fans go crosscountry to find him that's about it. I'm done so buy.
1, Master Chef Spatule Pelton Spatula: Great. Thin blade. Good blade stiffness. Good shape
0," Too strained and ""pop"" for the Virtuoso: Looking back on this album"
0, Poor excuse of a video: I am a HUGE Wilson Rawls fan. There was no attempt to make a quality video here. The cuts throughout the video were grade-school at the least. If someone would have just taken the time to edit and make sure the sound was right
1, BT does it again: BT has outperformed himself again. He has taken electronic music to the next level...again. Thanks for another great record
1, Vista-64 Driver hell. Throw Installation Disk in Trash: Step #1: Take a pair of pliers and twist the included installation disk until it breaks and then throw it in the trash.

That should do it.

0, Vulgar does not equal funny: Well
0, AVERAGE IDEAS..: This movie seems to be made of good isolated moments
1, ONE OF THE BEST JIM CARREY MOVIES!: This was by far one of the best Jim Carrey movies. I laughed so hard throughout the entire thing. Jim Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates
0, better luck next time: In fairness to Jimm Carey
0, Me
1, Crude
0, The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: This movie was so bad that after 15 minutes my husband (a huge Jim Carrey fan) wanted to leave the theatre. Don't waste time or energy on this movie. The gags were not funny and the story line stunk. I'd give this negative stars if I could - it was a waste of money.
0, bleh: The movie itself is a snoozer. There's a good amount of physical comedy
0, Zero Stars.: We could not watch more than 10 minutes
1, The farrelly brothers best: Ok
1, Mariah & Aretha were outstanding: This is one of the best mixture of diva power. In order
1, they're awesome...but Shania's the perfection made woman!!!!: well
1, Got it on December: This is a very fabulous CD from Kenny Loggins
1, A warm and touching Christmas collection!: A long overlooked vocalist from the 70's
1," A Must For Any Holiday Music Collector: I usually buy 2 or 3 New Holiday CD's each year and Kenny's was the first on my list...and I was not disappointed. My favorite song is ""The Bells of Christmas"" but I love the way the whole CD flows from one song to another. The new holiday songs are destined to be classics. Thanks Kenny for many wonderful holiday memories. listening to this GREAT CD."
1, Invaders from Mars: When America feared invasion from other worlds during the 1950s
0, Boy sees a UFO through the woods.: Here is a little science-fiction film you can watch late at night if you can not sleep. It's only 78 minutes long. Guaranteed to put you to sleep. A boy (Jimmy Hunt) is abit frightened of the thunder and lightning. He sees a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) flying beyond the woods and landing. When his father goes to check on the UFO to see if his son is telling the truth
1, 50's Sci Fi at it's Best!: This is a classic 1950's film. A spaceship lands at night and only a young boy knows what is really going on. The special effects may not be up to par with modern films but it is a fun and exciting film that the whole family can enjoy. Put on the popcorn
0, BE CAREFUL!: I was very pleased to see that this old classic was released on DVD. Despite it's age
1," Stranger Than You'll Ever Be: Joel's breakout album. Love the song ""The Stranger"" but other songs always seem to get more airplay (""Just The Way You Are""). This is probably his best overall regular album."
1, Melodically interesting: Of course Joel will be known as one of the best melody-creators of our time. One can always hum a Joel melody effortlessly. Everyone knows Joel's famous tracks on this album
1, excellent movies and excellent seller: we love these movies. love the brother and sister vs evil stuff schtick waaayy better than the usual punky kids with the jock and slutty girl protagonists. the the cover is very high quality
1, You want love
1, great packing and prompt service: had to purchase a large quantity but it has a very long shelf life and saves me lots of $$$
0, Patience is rewarded: Finally
0, A waste of plasic is was printed on!: The recent DVD's released (including this one) is a total waste of money and is garbage. WHY THE HELL DID YOU CHANGE THE THEME MUSIC????? The theme music on this dvd is a stupid cheesy midi keyboard version of the original. The picture quality is not what you would expect
0, Love Andy Griffith...But: I love the Andy Griffith Show
0, Musical Information about Joe: If you look at the liner notes of this album there is a name that should pop out to you if you are a Four Seasons fan. That is Tommy DeVito
0, Didn't like the tone: I realize that Dummies books are supposed to be fun
0, not worth buying if you want to know all your birth options: Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles
0, Cannot download CD: The holiday music is very enjoyable but I purchased this CD to download to my IPOD and it will not download to iTunes and you cannot burn a CD from it.
0, disappointed: i purchased this CD b/c of the positive reviews on this website
1, The Most Underrated Billy Joel Album: Unfortunately
1, Blast from the past: A friend of mine who lived next door had an Atari 2600 video game system back in the early '80s. One game that we played a lot was Adventure
0, Wrong Parts: I Ordered this for a 1982 Suzuki Swtft GTI and now I went to install it
0," PYREX EXPLODES!`: DON'T BUY PYREX!!!! pyrex has a tendancy to EXPLODE for NO REASON! I worked for World Kitchen (owns Pyrex) and got tons of cases where pyrex exploded for no good reason. preheated ovens with no significante temp change... normal use and care and it EXPLODES!!!DON""T USE!!!"
1, Nat Cole influence: It's interesting to listen to these late 40's recordings and hear the heavy Nat Cole Trio influence in Ray's early sound. This is a few years before he became the innovator who took Gospel and R&B sounds
1, Awesome!: I recommend you listen to this fantastic album. Beautifully spacious and inventive programming by DJ Vadim weaving around thoughtful
0, Won Ton Mess: I have put off purchasing Won Ton Baby for a while
0, Absolutely Stupid
1, Delivered timely and as described: The poster was recieved within 7 days and it was exactly as described in the listing. The paper was think and it displays well. I put it in a wooden frame with a green matting and it looks beautiful.
1, Adorable!!: I was so excited to get my duck pan. I ordered it real late on the 3rd
0, Could not get past the venom: Traveling Mercies ranks as one of my favorites. Though my political viewpoint is quite different from the authors
0, Self-Help Without the Help: I share many of the same struggles which is why I hoped to find solid answers and a model to follow. Partway thru
0, like picking scabs: Lamott trudges tediously down the road most travelled. This book would serve well as a substrate for yeast cultures.If you want spiritual buttressing
0, over the top in unrefined distastefulness and disrespect for God: a deeply confused soul who needs profanity
0, hate of G W Bush: Hate of G W Bush would be a better title. My copy will not be sold or given away but will goes where it belongs in the trash. How dare the author write politics under the guise of faith!
0," Seen it all online at ""Salon.com"": I read many of these online already. The book is slender"
0," Really Disappointed: The first Anne Lamott I read was ""Operating Instructions"" when my wife and I were awaiting our first child 13 years ago. I loved her biting humor and style of writing and went on to read many more of her books. It was with anticipation I picked up her latest tome"
1, A Slight Flaw: My girl loves it but you have to be careful with it...anything more than a hand wash [or a very delicate cleaning cycle] and you may rip the mesh of it. Nice overall though; she looks great in it!
1, WW 2 Pacific War Revisited: If you've read the responsible histories of the Pacific War
0, Buy a different version of this wonderful book: I saw this show on Broadway and decided to re-read the book. Ordered this Fawcett/Ballantine version from Amazon for $7.99. The print is tiny
1, A quietly moving story: This is Michener's first novel
1, Lafave's best album: When you make a list of the best singer-songwriters Jimmy Lafave belongs on the it
1, Great Album to listen to and dance to! He is Terrific!!: I've listened to LaFave for a long time
1," A pleasure to the ears.: Allah Rakka's work on this album is great. The last track ""Raga Multani"" is the best on the disc. The previous tracks are short"
1, Good book: I really enjoyed reading it. It has great information about real love. This book really shows you how to walk in love.
1, The best book I've read on education.: In all the talk about education issues these days
1, The only formula baby would drink: My daughter was allergic to milk and soy (so we thought). We experimented with other formulas
1, Awesome - This book blew my mind!: I was so excited to finally get a copy of this book. After reading this book
0, I just don't get it: So Voight
0, Wow
0, Be careful of flying glass shards!: I always thought that Pyrex was very durable and able to withstand large temperature fluctuations-- which is why I've historically gone out of my way to purchase this brand. I've just had my 4.8 quart oblong Pyrex baking dish explode in the oven
1, Great Products!: This is a Christmas present for my daughter. I have always loved AirBake and Pyrex products and was not disappointed by their appearance. It is still two weeks before Christmas and she does not have them yet but wanted them because I have always used AirBake and Pyrex. Never disappointed by their performance!
0, Exploding Pyrex Bakeware: Having just had an incident where a Pyrex glass baking pan exploded in my oven
1, Oh god
1, Shadow Tracker is his name
0, Mythos: This cd is so anoying
1," Excellent: I played this CD at a Bridal Shower and brought it with me to my hair salon...everyone wanted to know who the group was...they loved it. This CD is excellent!!! It is one of the best ""new age"" groups I have listened to. The mix of various music styles is smooth and very relaxing. The various sounds that are combined with the music is superb. I love to listen to this after a stressful day or even while studying. I purchased ""The Reality of a Dreamer"" by MYTHOS also"
1, Ah... Life is good again!: This program is very basic. However
0, discontinues after 3 years: Don't buy Quicken. I was shocked to get an email from them saying that my Quicken 2004 software would no longer work for downloading data after April 30
1, Good Book: When Claudia has to baby sit for a practicaljoker nemed
1, Best series I have ever read!: I have read all the books in the Warriors series and I am anxiously awaiting the next one! It was a little wierd getting used to the switch in main characters in this book but I still love the book!
1, awesome book!: this book was awesome! the reason i only gave it 4 stars was because squirrelpaw was the most selfish
1, GREAT!!!: I don't know if it's the best in the Warriors series
1, Different
0, Coma and drone...: Huge up-surge lately in the so called 'singer songwriter'
1, Good
1, Alaskan Rescue: This is just entertainment
0, A not so incredible book about the Incredible 305th BG: It seems to me a real diservice to the men who flew with the 305th that this book was written. These novelized histories
1, Really Useful: If you want to fix your bad credit
1, Halibuts - Great surf music: The Halibuts are a great surf band with a dedicated following of surfers in the south bay of LA. Chumming is their first album and every song is a classic! Add this to your collection and you won't regret it.
1, A very very good collection: The very best surf music
1," Battery For Life!: I owned one other Baby-G watch that lost its battery life prematurely. I bought this watch for sport and casual wear. The band has unusual grayish-olive cast to it and the face readouts are clear. It is set up nicely for modal changes and the buttons are sensitive. But the best part is the long lasting (dare I say infinite?) life of its battery. It is charged by solar light and it saves the charge when put in a dark place. It keeps accurate time by resetting itself via a satellite signal from Colorado. How ""green"""
1, Best Watch Ever!: I really like this watch. It just feels right and looks great.Just had a few issues catching the atomic signal in some areas.Recommended.
1, Hope Season Two is Released Soon !: I read all of the other reviews regarding the video quality and I have to agree that it is not great
0, Horrible picture quality!: Room 222: Season OneDon't waste your money on this DVD collection. Upon immediate viewing you will notice that the distributor spent absolutely no money on remastering from the original television series. The picture quality is beyond poor. I was expecting quality equivalent to the Mod Squad series releases. I wouldn't even spend the money on a VHS version of this.
0, A let down: Pure frustration. Explanations are intermingled with irrelavant history lessons and pathetic jokes while not really explaining the subject. There is no natural learning progression as it jumps from basic method syntaxs to a highly complex code set. This book is neither a learning tool nor technical reference. Don't buy it
0, SAMS Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days: I am finding this book to be next to worthless. I knew nothing about Java prior to acquiring the book and my knowledge base has not expanded much since. I bought this book because I want to write Java Applets for incorporation into webpages. Every example in the book that I've tried either does not compile
0, Say what??: How can I review something that I have never ordered or received. They do look like they would be a nice set to have as I do a lot of baking.
1, just what i wanted: these bowls are the right sizes
1, fantastic: This is an item that seemed too good to be TRUE
1, Pyrex BHO: great for making BHO!! Works in a few minutes !! recommend this product to everyone !Great for food also & storage while not in use !
1, Read
1, En esta vida todo pasa: I first heard Diego Torres last April while on business in Mexico City. As fate would have it
1, Great Overview: Jackie Wilson was The Michael Jackson of His time in a League all His Own.Jackie sung with alot of Soul&Emotion.this Box set puts His Legacy into full context&what He meant.He was one of a kind as a Artist.you get the full details on the Arrangements&His Power at finding His Groove.
1, A humble display of a monumental piece: A truthful and modest account of the Goldberg Variations is presented by American pianist Samuel Bartos. The voicing is crystal clear and his cross-handed work in some movements are flawless. His playing is not ostentatious. In fact
1, 2 classic lp's on 1 cd (at last): any serious slim fan needs this cd in their collection. these 2 classic albums from the sixties were long overdue for a release on cd and at last we can all marvel at the vocal range and skill of slim.
0, It is defective: THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT
1, murder in the first: murder in the first might be an old movie
1, Historical drama: I agree with many before - this is amazing acting by Christian Slater and especially Kevin Bacon. It is written with such honesty and grit that the whole story is singular in its impact. A memorable performace that you won't want to miss - just not a 'family film' for those under 22. Nothing lewd - just a gut wrenching story.
1, great price: Three movies for a little of nothing! Murder in the first is the best! I haven't looked at the other two yet but my wife all of them
0," Pure B.S.: I just did some research on-line of the Henri Young at Alcatraz facts. Go to Alcatrazhistory.com and see for yourselves that this movie was a COMPLETE fabrication of the truth. The movie claims that it was ""inspired"" by the true story of Henri Young"
0," Don't do it!: I purchased this book through Amazon which continues to be an excellent source for written material.There is a real absence regarding instruction on ""Reading The Tape"". At least that's been my experience. I looked forward to receiving the book Techniques of Tape Reading by Vadym Graifer and Christopher Schumacher. I had been warned that it contained nothing remotely close to techniques for reading the tape. Still the title of the book convinced me otherwise. I was wrong about my supposition and wrong about the book. Said differently"
0, I wish I had listened to ProTrader: ProTrader was right. I consider the title of this to be false advertising plain and simple. There is no mention of or techniques or diagrams of Time and Sales
0, NOT VERY GOOD: I DIDN'T THINK THAT PARTY SUMMER WAS A GOOD BOOK. IT WASN'T EVEN SCARY OR SUSPENSEFUL! I LIKED THE BEGINNING AND IT HAS KIND OF A COOL ENDING
0," Tired: This is a cover of a song by ""Ready for the World"""
1, AMAZING: My Saab always had a semi-synthetic in it. Today I put RP in and WOW! The quite noticeable ticking sound that had been in the engine for the last 3 years is gone. SMOOTH running now like never before. And if you go to the Wmart for an oil change
1, Best Oil Ever: Once I started using this oil
1, Well Illustrated: Nice HST pictures
1, A fine read!: Dr. Schonfield has been the recipient of much undeserved flak from those who missed the point of his prior work
0, Non-functioning CD: This CD no longer works on computers with the latest operating systems. It was made for Windows 95-98 and Mac 4.x . I neglected to download the CD to my computer when I got it
1, Nice player for the Money: I guess I'm one of the few to say it's nice inexpensive player. The sounds quality is great for the price...I got this mainly because of the small size for working out.To compair the 2 I would say the D-link sound quality is close to that of the more expensive Kazoo...And in my opinion the D-link sofware for downloading is actually more flexable to use than the MusicMatch that came with the Kazoo.Don't get me wrong...I'm very happy with my Kazoo...but for the price difference the D-link is a great bargin...I've had it for over 5 month...no problems. Agian...especially for the price.
1, SNL David Spade: as always SNL best of does have it's hilarious moments. For the most part best of David Spade was worth watching
0, Not for the kids!: The movie stars Kirk Douglas and is based on a book by Jules Verne
0, Don't buy this thing!!!: It SUCKS!!! This controller doesn't work with Windows XP. Buy it at your own risk!!!
1, Great Method!: I am a vocal method aficionado
1, A solid investment for any singer or teacher: This is an excellent companion for the conservatory singing student. I can maximise the time I get with my teachers by concentrating on the fundamentals in my own time with the use of the CD excersizes. I found Jeffrey Allens speaking tone pleasant - and he shows a mastery of his own singing voice. The trouble-shooting guide is both informative and well set out.
0, Wanda the Whale: This machine does not work at all like it is said to work.The thing stops and does not move for up 10 minutes.
0, Hayward Pool Cleaner: Pool cleaner does not work. Return water to pool prevents cleaner from moving around the bottom of the pool.Save your money.
1, Great for the price: Hayward 900 Wanda the Whale Above-Ground Automatic Pool CleanerThis is a great product. We had bought an Aqua Bug
1, Does a great job!: I purchased this pool cleaner to replace a Kontiki cleaner that worked pretty well
1, Good for intex pools: I have a 24' intex pool. The bottom is not that smooth in some areas. This product does a good job. Takes a little longer than I would like but eventually gets everything. I put it in when I don't have time to do it by hand.
0, Don't recommend: After receiving this product in anticipation that it would save me a lot of cleaning time
1, Excellent product: I have to admit that I wasn't expecting too much when I purchased Diver Dave. What a pleasant surprise when I inspected the pool after a few hours!!!! The bottom of the pool was completely dirt free. Diver Dave did a better job in 2 hours than I could ever do with the vacuum.
1," Effective work saver: This pool cleaner works very well for above ground pools even with a ""deep end"". We had a similar product previously (I think Hayward bought out that company) that had given many years of good service at 3 times the price."
0, I'd rather do it by hand!: I followed the instructions to a T
0, Wanda the Flop: We purchased Wanda the Whale beginning of 2011 pool season. Right from the beginning it would not work even though we had a brand-new Hayward pool filter and pump (oversized). Started customer service with Hayward
0, HIghly DIsappointed: I purchased this product based on the great reviews on Amazon. Unfortunatley
1, Amazing!: Wanda is amazing! It took less than 10 minutes to install her. The amount of hose that came with her is perfect for my 24' round AG pool. Directions were very simple and easy to follow. She has been running for about and hour and is almost done. Great investment!
1, good upgrade: Great bang for the buck. I replaced my stock 6.5 inch with these for a much improved sound. easy install.
0, Buy it used
0," "" Smile"".........It never really was.: To those of us that were around at the time"
0, Smile: This is the worst music I have ever listened to. It is no wonder that record companies are losing sales
1, Amazing: This album is complex and elaborated
0, Huh? What am I missing?: I gave this lost classic a listen after tons of great reviews and boy was I disappointed. I just don't get it. It sounds like the ramblings or a schizophrenic. If I wanted that I would listen to Wesley Willis. I fail to see any genius in the material and I couldn't bear to listen for long. Unless you are fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.... stay away. Unless you like to be tortured by music.
0, What could have been is what isn't.: For those people trying to relive the glory that Pet Sounds represented
1," Genius... a masterpiece for the ages: I am listening to ""Smile"" now on Rhapsody. This album sounds fresh"
1, Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul: The book helped me work things out in my family and things atschool. I have one of the books and I enjoy things that relate to thereal world.
0, disappointing: i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors
1, Barnyard Song: The book Barnyard Song is a great book to read as an adult and to read to my three year son. I love the way the book flows. The animals in this book develop the barnyard flu that they catch from a fly. Then the doctor and his nurse come buy and give check out the barnyard animals and give them farmer some medicine. During the time of the flu the barnyard song just doesn't sound right. Once the animals get the medicine and they all get themselves to feeling better---then the barnyard song starts sounding great. THis is a great book to read to a group of children! My child carries the book around and loves to look at the pictures also!
0, Not gig: I have a Vista PC
0," Minus 10000 stars: This book is complete garbage. There is nothing in it that is factual. If you want to read tabloid material please go buy ""National Enquirer"" or something.. Don't give your hard earned money or attention to this guy. He never knew The Harrison's and the book is fabricated stories by zealous bad author. Please go buy George's book ""I Me Mine"" or The Beatles 'Anthology"" book is want to learn the truth about the man."
0, Worst Product Ever: You would have to be stupid to buy this microsoft hardware. Although this joystick works with the current Windows XP operating system (not very well though)
0, Microsoft doesn't support their own products!: I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick
0, Boooring: Not an easy book to read. With most CW books by the time I have read about 1/4 of the way through I sense a flow of words. I never got there with this book. I was disappointed the first time but actually read the book a second time to give it a chance. Unfortunately it didn't get any better. A more enjoyable treatment of Day 1 at Gettysburg is 'Gettysburg The First Day' by Harry W. Pfanz.Also recommended: Gettysburg The First Day by Harry Pfanz Covered with Glory by Rod Gragg The First Day at Gettysburg by Gary Gallagher
0, Riddled with error
1, beautiful doll!!: Hi
1, Paul Burch swings old-style.: Paul Burch is a terrific singer-songwriter. Though a resident of Nashville
1, Meat Thermometer: The Taylor 806 is a very accurate and inexpensive meat thermometer. I would recommend this product.
0, sponge bob joke book: My grandson who is 6 yrs old didn't like the book. He couldn't understand more than half of the jokes. Not very funny.
0, ....: I have never gotten tired of The Fleetwoods and have listened to them for 35 years. This CD is such a poor quality .... The producers
1, Good Movie But It Is Not In Color!: There are several Roy rogers movies on VHS that are listed as being in color when they are not. This is one of those. It is made by Alpha Omega Publications and is dated Oct. 19th
1, Garfield (and Odie) save the day!: Jon takes Garfield and Odie to a renaissance faire. Jon goes for the jousting. Odie goes for the slobbering. Garfield goes because Jon makes him
1, My favorite Giant White Underpants.: I'm not the bikini or thong type. I like comfort. I originally bought a pair of these briefs at a travel store when I went to China
1, inspiring: An incredible story about 2 very courageous women and how we all can make a difference. A true lesson about Love
0, Disappointed: This DVD was better than the 1st one that I purchased [Diary of Alicia Keys-Documentary
0, Do not buy this if you are a Puppy fan!!!: I can't beleive these bands participated in this horrible tribute to skinny puppy. They took some of their greatest songs and mangled them terribly. You will be disappointed and saddened.
1," Better with each listen: The first time I heard ""Shangri-La"" I was disappointed. After the second listen I thought: groovy. Now I've heard it 6 or 7 times and I like it"
0, Fall asleep if not careful: A few really good songs. Several boring ones. That seems to be Mark's way these days.
1, The Way Things Ought To Be: A nice look back to a time when LL Bean sold he-man stuff and not all the yuppie junk they sell today. A look back to the time when a hunter/fisherman/trapper in the woods looked normal and not like something out of a cartoon.
1, Inexpensive protection for your camcorder lens.: The camera I purchased has a lens cover that closes automatically when you turn off the camera
1, Land Survey Review Manual: I purchased this book in 2004 in preparation for the National PLS Exam after failing the exam by 3 points on the first attempt. In my opinion
1, Sehr Gut: Kind of bought this only because of Johnny Depp
0, Absolutely the worst.: These should be taken off the market. Every single one of the discs was corrupt. Unreal.
1, If you don't have this
1, wayne virgo has talent!: shank is a very well-done indie british film. while often painful to watch due to the subject matter(violence)it is smartly written and directed. the acting is also quite good over-all. special notice should go to wayne virgo
0, Quicken 2006 is not Vista ready...caution: I was running Quicken 2006 with no problems until I upgraded to Vista. SURPRISE 2006 is not fully compatible with Vista
0, look elsewhere: I own Quicken Deluxe 2006. I used Quickbooks PRO in my office for 5 years and found that Quickbooks Pro was easy to use. Quicken Deluxe is a wreck. It is not at all intuitive. It can't tell that there is a difference between when a check is written and when it clears. The numbers it downloads from brokerages etc don't correlate with what one finds on the brokerage web site. I suppose that there is a reason but I wanted this program to save me time not make more work. So far it has been much more work. If you are obsessed with money and want to spend all your time playing what amounts to an online game with Quicken then I suppose that you might like this program. I don't have any suggestions for an alternative but there must be something better. I think that you would do better making your own Excel spreadsheet or downloading one of the free ones that are available.
0, Going to Try Microsoft Money: I have been using Quicken longer than I can remember. But like most of the recent reviewers here
0, Frustration with software bugs and LOUSY tech support: I have been using Quicken since 1999 very happily. Unfortunately
0, Finally they admit to having a huge BUG!: After three phone calls to their India based customer support
0, What fun!: I finally started enjoying this software when I realized it's not really a financial management software program
1, #1 Money Software: This is the best software I have gotten for my computer.I have said goodbye to balanceing my check and said hello to quicken. It has made every finical transction fast easy and enjoyable.
0, Support from Intuit is absolutely useless!!!: Don't get this software and expect to be able to convert your data from a MAC to a Windows based PC! I have been trying for over a week now and the online chat support was absolutely useless! He treated me as if I had no knowledge of how to even turn on a computer
0, Unreliable: This drive is very unreliable. Backing up (copying) small number of files works ok; however when trying to copy large number of files
1, one of the best books I have read all year!: The Magus of Nastrand is a remarkable tale. Slade Chandler's chronicle of a man's journey from importance
1, Another classic Dr Seuss book: Although its not as great as The Cat in the Hat
1, AWESOME BOOK: This book is one of my favorite children books. This book is a real easy book to read for a young child. This book tells about the colors of fish
1, Dr. Seuss is amazing: The book One fish
1, Great for Child and Parent: I used to read and love this when I was a kid and now that i have a 17-month-old child I love reading it to my son. He enjoys the drawings and the sound of the words. It is fun for me to read and give voices too. The weird thing is that I remember some of the drawings line for line from when I was younger. This really must have made a strong impression on me. I hope it does the same for my son.
0, GOODBYE DEE DEE...: Brain Drain was the last album to feature Dee Dee Ramone as a member of the band. The band's inner turmoil is evident in what is their second-to-worst album (their prior album
1, Brain Teaser: Brain Drain is a highly under rated album. It has alot of songs that could have been hits
0, Ugh! Another Bad One!: The only reason this gets a star is for the 3 singles off this cd. The rest Who Cares?
0, time line challenged: I had problems with this book early on
0, My first: I have never written a review of any kind. This book was so bad I felt it necessary to warn off others who may be foolish enough to spend money on it.I read about 1300 pages per week so I know quality work when I read it.Absolutely horrible and unbelievable. If this were the last book on Earth
0, pirate: couldn
1, A step above Cussler!: I read with interest the reviewer who dissed this book and couldn't disagree more. As a once Cussler fan I got bored with the sameness and the venture off into the Sci-fi arena. Ted Bell does it a little better and it remains to be seen if he continues on this path. Loved the twins
1, from the school of giallo: British horror movie
0, Pales in comparison to their first CD: I was excited to buy Alabina's second CD; as among my collection
1, Classic 80's horror: I'm very pleased this was finally released on DVD. Since it's release in 1987 it has been an underappreciated cult horror andnearly impossible to find on VHS (found my copy at a pawn shop).Transfer to DVD will no doubt be crystal clear
0, DON'T ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON!!!!: Unless you want to wait over a month to get your product
0, Poor quality: The lights are very faint and glow for about two hours after sunset. Half of the lights are on for less than an hour. I am returning my lamps.
0, meh: I got the CD I wanted and it worked
1, This gift set is perfection!: I adore this Silkstone gift set. I am a big Silkie collector
1, Good: Helps me with my DIY car maintenance. I am annoyed by the use of special VW tools in the book which are not necessary.
0, NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!: In some of the other reviews of this product it was mentioned that this was a good series that was family oriented. I strongly disagree! I really enjoy period movies but this was so full of adultery and fornication that I was ashamed that I watched it. Please do not buy this series if you plan to watch this with your family.
0, WHAT!!!: I loved the drama but BEWARE..how disapointing...WHAT.. is with the ending
1, A True Find: Love this series. So refreshing
1, Extremely Enjoyable: I bought this DVD set mainly for my wife as I have so many `men' DVD's but we both found it was a very good series
1, nice story: I got reeled into this story
1, really enjoyed this: i watched this the 1st week i got it and realy enjoyed it
1, Need a sequel for closure: So many twists and turns in this I wish there had been a sequel. Really good 
0, Disappointing: As a great lover of BBC period pieces
1," Can't use a ""regular"" mouse after using one of these for 4 years...: This is my second Trackball mouse.We have been using them for over 4 years now. I love them as do my children. There is almost no wrist movement necessary which reduces your risk of Carpel Tunnel. These are great for everyone. They do take a few days to get use to"
1, Great trackball for typical environments: When I started working at Microsoft in 2000
1, Better than ever: I was a previous user of the Logitech trackball mouse
1, Blows ANY standard mouse away: I've been using one version or another of this Logitech
1, a great product: i realy love this mouse because you don't have to move the mouse just use the ball and your arrow move.
1, Excellent. But
1, Wonderful Item: The Item is a little larger than I expected
1," Great Trackman: I've used a different version of this in the past but that version wasn't available so I ordered the Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical. It works great. I love the thumb ball and will never go back to a ""regular"" mouse again."
0, A fall from grace
1, Trackman Wheel best trackball on the market: Most computer users who use a mouse have never even tried a trackball
1, I bought this for $25 two years ago.: This is a great product when you can get it for a reasonable price! I bought my first one two years ago but the left button switch wore out last week. When I checked to order another one a couple days ago the price was $199 and I soon discovered this was because Logitech is no longer making the wired version. Luckily I checked back today and a vendor was selling them for $34
0, Logitech Trackman Wheel should be more popular!: Very convenient mouse. Why would you want to move your wrist/arm when you can do it all
1, Great product
0, Logitech Trackman Wheel Mouse: This mouse just didn't work for me
1, logitech trackman wheel: This is better than any mouse I have ever used and I hate going back to the old style mouse I use at work. I wish they had this available as a high performance gaming mouse. I bought one of those high dollar ones and I don't like it nearly so much as the trackman wheel.
1, Not so great for macs: I love the Trackman Wheel that I use with my PC. When I bought one for my Mac Book
0, Terrible: I've used Quicken forever
0, Intuit continues its streak of terrible products: Intuit continues its streak of terrible products

1, Gospel Comedy Laughs: I purchased this dvd because I wanted good clean comedy that was good for my whole family. These dudes are funny! I enjoy watching this.
1, Passed the exam.: I passed the exam after spending several hours studying this book. One needs to already have a working knowledge of mechanics
1, Their best album ever!: This is a hypnotic album that transports you to amazing places. It's my number one album of all time
0, book long advertisement: After my son was diagnosed with oral motor dyspraxia I checked this book out of the libary. What a waste of paper! It is a book long ad for his program in Pennsylvania. It did not have anything useful for a parent with a newly diagnosed neurologically disabled child.Skip it
0, NO WAY! STAY CLEAR FROM THIS CHANGER: Got this in the mail and the tag attached to this changer pad is DISTURBING.Do not want anything near my newborn with a tag that reads: that there may exist trace amounts of chemicals in this product known to cause cancer and birth defect or other reproductive harm. Was shocked Target / Million Dollar Baby would even sell a product like this. Who would use this on their child with a tag that has this warning? I would like to meet that parent....
0, blech: I like watching beautiful naked women get it on as much as the next guy
0, Don't buy it: While this modem gives good speed after it connects
1, le chant du cygne d'Horowitz ?: Non ce n'est pas à cause de son ge qu'Horowitz est si intime :Il magnifie encore sa technique du pianissimo et son art de sculpter le son comme il a cherché à le faire toute sa vie. Et comme il y parvient une fois de plus
1, Excellent Resource for Aspiring VAs!: I've read this and another of Diana's books and she is very thorough and knowledgeable in the administrative and entrepreneurship fields. Throughout reading the book
0," By far the worse season: I watched all the ""2 & half men"" seasons. I LOL from the 1st episode of the 1st season to the 7th one of the 6th season"
1, It's Royal Purple!: Good price
1, Best oil for the money!: I've always liked Royal purple. It just last longer compared to other synthetic oils
0, RIO Not So XP Friendly: The RIO One was a free bonus for purchasing Windows XP at Best Buy. Unfortunately
0, Worked for a while
1, Nice Tent - short Review: I have only used this tent twice: One practice backyard setup and one overnight campout. The tent was not difficult to set up. First time
0, JUST OLD AND PREDICTABLE: THIS TIME
0, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION: This is not a review of the text itself
1," Best Deal I Ever Got: I bought this CD at a 99 store along with with Evil Mothers' ""Spider Sex and Car Wrecks."" After listening to Cashcratix I wondered why Gunjah never made it. Best tracks here are Hit Me"
1, Absolute Foundation of Tonal Music: This is an indispensable work for anyone with a serious interest in musical composition. It lays out the entire foundation of tonal composition (i.e.: counterpoint) in a lucid
1, required reading for composers
1, Vintage Clint: A very touching portrait of a might-have-been performer. Both funny and sad
0, Horrid- all white margin space: The cut size of this print is impressive.However
0, meh: Product was recieved quickly and burns fine
1, AMAZING!: I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate
1, like it: Great shoes for aerobic workouts! The shoes fit well with arch supports and I'm enjoying the Asics. My podiatrist is a fan of Asics
1, A splendid concert: It was just great seeing and listening to Cat Stevens seeing and playing some of his old tunes. The setting is intimate which makes it more pleasant.
1, Yusuf's Cafe: This DVD is Awesome! I encourage all of you old Cat Stevens fans out there to get it. Some new
0, No Wonder Frank Cheated: Yet more evidence which testifies toward the flawed character of Kathy Lee. Highly deplorable.
1, Pocket herb guide: One of the best guides i have seen
1," They're back...and YOU KNOW THIS!!: Finally. It's about time that we got the 3rd Storee album everyone's been waiting for. This is one of the best album I've had the pleasure of hearing. Their first single ""Get With Me"" topped the charts. The album is full of solid hits. From the sad love of ""I'm SOrry"""
1, 3rd Storee's album...a hugh success.: With beats by Rodney Jerkins
1, Wax Poetic: Nublu Sessions is a great sounding record fusing jazz with electronic and worldbeat flavors. Norah Jones' two songs that appear on Nublu Sessions were ones she regularly sang with Wax Poetic while she was in the group. Wax Poetic is a revolving door of talent with contributions from U-Roy
1, Daughter's favorite: My daughter is 25 years old. She was born with Down Syndrome and spastic cerebral palsy
0, What a let down . . .: I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase. Boy was I wrong. Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware
0, Very bad quality: I bought a Creative Zen Microphoto less than a month ago. It worked great for about 3 weeks
0, Awesome when it worked: I really enjoyed my Zen
0, Not worth the time!: This is the one book by Stephen King I could not finish. Usually his books grab me from the first paragraph but this one held no interest at all. I quit about a 1/4 of the way through and didn't even care enough to turn to the back pages to find out how it ended.King has only left me disapointed once before and that was with Gerald's Game.
0, A pretty good short story packaged and priced as a novel !!: I have enjoyed SK for many years and truely love many of his works. The Dark Tower Series may be the best series I've ever read and I actually read both versions of the Stand and loved them both
0, The Girl Who Loved T.G. & Wasted My Time: I had not read any Stephen King and picked up this novel as a sample. A huge disappointment. The story is weak and contains little suspense. Given the nature of his success
0, No reason for this to be put on paper.: This short (224 pages) novel begs the question
1, Ordinary people in extraordinary situations: Ordinary people in extraordinary situations. That is what Stephen King likes to write about
1, The girl who stole my heart: My father pushed The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon at me for 10 years but I wouldn't read it. I was mad at Stephen King because he had let me down
1, One of his best..... Period...: Okay for all of you people who didn't like this book you clearly are just not people who like actual literature you just wait until the novel comes on paperback and pick it up while you're in the line in the grocery store. For the rest of you this story chilled me to the bone and brought me close to tears more than once. In this story you are introduced to Trish who wanders away from her mother while on a hike and becomes lost in the Maine woods. This may sound simple but as the story unfolds you are pulled into the mind of this very young and terrified girl
1, Good reading - hard to put down.: I really enjoyed this book. I didn't think I would by the book jacket
0, This book was slow
0, In a word dissapointed: Please belive me I love Stephen King and have read all his books (does every review start off like this?) But this one left me wanting a lot more. I think he could have done a lot more character development. Not only with Trisha but Pete and her parents needed more content. I guess I am spoiled. But I really think Mr King is resting on his laurels on this one (reminds me of Cujo).
1, Magnificent!: Is it me or does King just keep getting better?! I loved this book and poor little Trisha McFarland. I fought myself reacting to her out loud. Another amazing book by the incredible Mr. King.
0, Not the Steven King I remembered as a kid: Don't get me wrong- this story was well written
0, Typical King. Slow and poorly written.: It is hard to believe that this man has been so successful. This is the fourth book I've read by King and (of those four) only The Green Mile was any good. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is slow moving and dull. One more thing. The Red Sox catcher is Jason VARITEK.
0, TEDIOUS AND BORING: I got tired of the whole thing after 50 pages of nothing but a lost girl walking in the woods
1, King's New Direction? No slobbering creatures in this one.: A good read
1, Hits a home run!: King at his best
0, Not worth the time!: This is the one book by Stephen King I could not finish. Usually his books grab me from the first paragraph but this one held no interest at all. I quit about a 1/4 of the way through and didn't even care enough to turn to the back pages to find out how it ended.King has only left me disapointed once before and that was with Geerald's Game.
0, A blown save opportunity: The premise of King's book is too good: a young girl lost in the woods
1, Haunting
1, A Novel to Read Over and Over: This novel is about survival to say the least. When reading this novel
0, Ho Hum for the most part: I can only hope that Mr. King wrote this to make a few bucks until he finishes the next Dark Tower series! I listened to the 4 CD version of this book and after CD #1 and #2
0, This book kind of sucked: I didnt really like this book
1, OFTEN IMITATED...NEVER DUPLICATED: The many years that have gone by has not diminished the importantce of this recording. This album is the closet thing to perfection.Just think when you first heard bits and pieces of Sgt. Pepper and then when you sat down and listened to the entire album. Do you think that groups like The Backstreet Boys or In Synch will be able to hold up after 32 years? I doubt it.
1, the golden days of hollywood: I first saw this movie at the age of 16 and last fall I viewed it again at the age of 56.Deanna makes you laugh
0, Not a digital camera: Thought it was a digital camera. So I couldn't rate this camera. I sent it back about 3weeks ago and still haven't receive my refund. Hope the seller ( New 2 Sell) credits me soon.
1, Great camera if you can still find one!: I received this camerera as a prize and would recommend it to anyone. We use this camera as our primary camera for everything! I took it in with me when my daughter was born
1, My personal experience: If you decide to purchase this watch
1, Classic Foodie Dishing and Keeping with the Times!: I've been subscribing to Bon Appetit since 1993 (when I was 17 years old no less)and pretty much enjoyed every issue. My favorites are the special holiday issues
1, Great Buy!: This subscription came very quickly
0, What is this
1, No black coffee please: I love these little mints
1, H-A batteries: Seller was very fast with the delivery. The batteries seem to last as well as can be expected (2-3 days). We are new to hearing aid use and the batteries that came with the devices lasted the same amount of time.
0, Confusing book on basic biology topics: My son is using this book in his freshmen 'intro to biology' course. This book is so incredibly difficult it rivals some of my advanced biology classes taken in college. The wording is complex and written at such a high level that even I have to re-read many sentences. Too many big words and complex ideas packed into a small space. The graphics are not very helpful. I would never consider buying this book if I was a science teacher. My son now hates science because of the complexity of the topics presented. Fine for a college level class
0, [NO GOOD!]: This book is no good
1, Great series! Recommend to everyone!!!: When I saw this
1, Great Box Set: This is the collection if you are a Tenchi Muyo lover. I love watching all the episodes and they are all worth it.
0, Didn't make it: This is an unfunny comedy. Only a few sight gags will keep you awake. The story is about two young people who live together and then decide to marry
1, Cute Movie!: This is a cute movie. It is about a rich girl and a poor boy and how their families object to them getting married. The marriage doesn't work out. This movie is about the rich girl and the poor boy on their honey moon and the hilarious situations they get themselves into.RECOMMENDED!
0," Horribly Un-Funny: Some people may think this movie is funny I have to disagree. I think this was just a failed attempt to make lots of money by putting garbage on the screen. The jokes - not funny at all. I don't understand how saying ""Bonjour! Merci Bonjour! Merci!"" over and over again can make people actually laugh"
0, Not for Sensitive Skin - Contains parabens: Looks great. But after a few uses caused breakouts at usage sites. Also caused broken blood vessels where under-eye area meets regular skin. Sadly
0, 3-star: It's garbage. Full of adverts/commercials. Just a few health talk or discussion. This is not the Health magazine or journal of those days.
1, This came REALLY fast!: I already give this magazine 5 stars
0," Have to agree with ""Vapid"" ...: I received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing. Boy"
1, great magazine and service.: I do the ordering based on what the wife asks for. I have also read the magazines and am very pleased with the customer service from the Health magazine and how easy and inexpensive subscriptions are via Amazon. I did not know that amazon had magazine subscips until our daughters told us and have been using them ever since. I must say that Amazon does much more than I had really known and they do it so very good. They apparently have great relationships with the publishing companies and the service is second to none
1," The Twisted Badge: Entertaining and informative. Anyone concerned with the future direction and intended targets of the ""War on Drugs"" would do well to study the chapter entitled ""Operation Desert Snow"" for it's revealing look at the federally funded drug interdiction programs perpetrated on our interstate highways."
1, OH MY GOSH!!!!!!: I don't care what anyone says
0, not as good as the first Kevin Kerney novel actually: I liked the first Kevin Kerney novel much better. This one seemed almost the same
1, GREAT SOURCE FOR DOG: Any dog fancier or dog owner
1, magazine order: I purchased a Dog Fancy magazine subscription for my mother as a Christmas gift. An email was delivered to her as promised and she received the first issue of the magazine last week
0, check out Dog and Kennel: this magazine is not at all what i expected. if you want the most for your money
1, A Place in Every Christian Library: Stephen Ray's book
0, Who would waste their money?!: This is truly the low-water mark of the so-called Goth Music phenomenon. The members of this band are as lacking in taste as they are in talent. If you have any self-respect whatsoever
1, Trial By Fire: The book discription does not do this book justice. Terri's discriptive wording makes you feel as though you are there with them. You can even feel the fear. When I started reading this book I was unable to put it down. It will captivate your attention from the beginning. There is always something exciting happening. I recommend this book to all my friends and family.
1, Love It: This is one of Dave Eggar's better CD's. I have others of his but this is by far
0, Greatest comedy since Blazing Saddles...wait
0, The BEST cover EVER
1, One of their best!: At long last
0, environmental design
1, A Crazy
1, Very fun
1, wow: I love the mod support for this game. I far surpasses the original. now multiple mod's can be used instead of the pesky 1 dominant and the other small mod's that had to be installed manually. i'm real impressed
1, Good Speakers For The Price.: I won't over hype these speakers as the greatest
1, A thoroughly satisfying read!: This novel elegantly portrays the psychological impact that segregation had on those who lived through it-and on the rest of us by association. It is an excellent narrative of our struggles with memory and its hold on our present selves. As an oral historian
0, It used to work: I have used this product for several years. I found the old product in the black container to be working very well. When the company changed its packaging
0, New version of lavilin sucks: I've been using lavilin for many years. But this new version is nowhere NEAR as effective as the old version in the black round box.My bet it the major deodorant companies have bought the Lavilin company
1, Lavilin works
1, One bad item in it that is it!: Considering that this is for your underarms that is astounding. One petroleum product
1, The Entertainment movie: Manoranjan - The Entertainment also tells the story of aspiring actors
0, Disappointing: We love these crackers
0, Food & Wine: I ordered this magazine on Nov. 20th and it is now Feb. 1st I have not even received anything. The same day I ordered this magazine I ordered another and I have already received 2 issues of that magazine. I am not impressed with the speed.
0, good luck actually getting the magazine: i wouldn't know if this was a good magazine
0, Pointless: Uninteresting...written haphazzardly with an annoying
0, Just not that compelling: I gave the book 100 pages to say something halfway intriguing. It never did. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for one of those deep introspective books. I probably just wanted a good story. Henderson never interested me. I never felt like the journey was worth continuing. The character was just plain dull.
1, Wonderful book: Just wonderful. Bellow is a spectacular writer and his use of language is just amazing. I'd suggest it for sure.
1, Great Gothic: Loved this Gothic tale of an alchemist who invents a way to live for ever
0, Typical...: ... I finally watched this anime after hemming and hawing for months... I wish that I had continued my resistance. The characters were typical; the story line
1, A decent box set: This set collects the seven individually-released Chobits DVDs and puts them into one package. The set also includes a soundtrack CD (Chobits: Character Song Collection).The extras on the DVDs were OK
1, More Taste Less Filling!!: For those of us looking for that little different taste profile without alot of mess
0, Glass cooktop breakage with stovetop smoker: I used the smoker with good results the first time
1, Stovetop Smoker: I was looking for a product like this and found it here at amazon and was so excited to try it out and I am really happy with it
1, Wonderful Construction: This is small (single fish-sized) but solidly constructed and works like magic. Very little smoke escapes
1, Burgers in my apartment: As an aparment dweller
1," GREATEST ALBUM IN KISSTORY!!: This is KISS' finest moment. The album where the makeup was removed and they let the music do the talking! And do the talking it did!! KISS played 6 songs off this Klassic cd as part of their regular set list. Gene Simmons was in top form on this cd as was Paul Stanley. But the real credit for this release goes to the man who saved KISS....the Egyptian Warrior...Vinnie Vincent!Vinnie co-wrote 8 of the 10 songs on LIU...all of which are metal masterpieces.If you want the best release in KISSTORY...look no further than ""Lick It Up""!"
0, DO NOT READ!!: This book is about a real place-Moonfleet wich is in Dorset.It is told by a man caled John Trenchard.He is looking back on when he was fifteen years old and this is when the story takes place. At the centre of the story is a diamond.John's mission to find the diamon dbegins and ends in Moonfleet.In the story we are takin into vaults haunted by the legendary ghost of Blackbotherwise known as Colonel John Mohune.We are taken down long
0, Don't bother buying it: I was so disappointed in this video. You should know it's underwritten by Huggies Training Pants--they only tell you about the AMA part. The advice from the doctors is the same as you will find anywhere. The video is short
1, Explores the influence of the pseudo-occult: William Patterson's Voices In The Dark provides a very different focus on Nazi-occupied Paris from 1940-44: it explores the influence of the pseudo-occult in the idealogy of the new order
1, Works well: we have flying squirrles
1, I Love This Movie.: I love this movie because it is fun to watch and the scenes are not boring at all. My two favorite characters is Smokey and Ezell. My favorite part is when Smokey told Craig about what happen to Redd. And i like when he said you got knocked the (...)out. I`ve seen this movie a million times and it gets better and better. I won`t never get tired of this movie. So if yall don`t like this movie something is wrong with you.
1, Funny: This is now a classic movie that will always bring you laughter. Chris tucker was very funny and Ice cube knocked it out the park on this first movie.
1, thank god it's friday: I am a white man straight out of LBC homies. Due 2 tha fact i was born and raised in the ghettos of L.A and North Long Beach
1, FUNNY!: Wow! when you put chris rock and Ice Cube in one movie you now this is going to be funny! This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. A great start to a great sequeal. Watch this movie and every friday in the sequeal. Highly Recommended
1, Not too bad of a deal.: The movies came in original packaging and wrap. All of the DVD's play but the third one freezes up at random places in the movie. Over all they came in good condition and work for the most part.
0, Full Price for 1/3 a Magazine: Like others have said
1, Leader of a culture: I get the feeling the people making this mag really like what they're doing and are good at it. They do a good job covering the whole country instead of just one region. Even though I live very near the White Mountains it's a lot of fun to hear ideas that come form other parts of the country. It's like hearing reports on a distant family member and what they're doing and it gets you thinking a little differently about how your doing things here. I only wish the mag's were longer.
1, Backpacker Review: Love the magazine
0, More Christian dishonesty: This film was legend in the history of evolution science community before it was released
1, What can I say. My daughter's named after this film!: The first time I saw Shenandoah was in 1965
1, very good: If you like old movies this ones for you so sit back and enjoy this wonderful movie with James Stewart
1, Shenandoah: Good movie as are most movies with James Stewart. I was watching it mainly to get a better understanding of some of the attitudes of people during the Civil War. It certainly gave me that although I am not sure I would rate it in the top 10 of the movies about people caught up in this War as some others have.
1, A Media Writer Must-Have: This book always with me in addition to my AP Stylebook. It's wonderfully helpful in all areas of writing
1, An Ingenious Way to Divinate!: I had always heard that one could divinate from a regular pack of playing cards but usually it is in the context of a truncated Tarot without the major arcana. This system is unique in the sense that it is astrologically based not Tarot based and you can spend less than $10 on a decent pack of playing cards
1, Fits my needs: This product fits my needs perfectly. Large enough to fit my hands comfortably and well made. The only quibble would in the area of programming some of the functions.
0, developed excellently but in vain!: Hold it! The Church may hear! Ssshhh... Okay... Well
1, Great price: I have wanted to read this book again for a long time. I was so glad to find a great price for a new copy.
1," A Great Story...Even Years Later: The ""Editorial Review"" above is"
1, Nice: It's a shame modern Princeton (or any other college) is not half as wondereful. Nice book
1, My Side of Paradise: I thought this book was amazing! F. Scott Fitzgerald really has a way to write a book! I love the way the book is formatted (into 3 different books). Also
0, Don't Buy!: I purchased three Rex's for myself and two other peopleon the advice of my friend who liked the product.Within a month
1, correction: shangs75 wrote that the rex 5000 doesn't take addresses. It does. The box and website is missleading too bacause all you see is a name and a phone number
0, I THOGHT IT SUCKED!!!!!: I really liked the first one alot. and then I rented this lame excuse of a movie. And just how did he survive after getting shot in the head multiple times with a friggin' nail gun. And he's just driving away laughing!!! How stupid!!! It started off all slow and then turned into a slasher movie!! And it isn't so damn cool like the original. But Bernsen was good as usual.
0, THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE.: THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. THE ACTING IS EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!!!
0, Boring story line & poor acting: Corbin does a miserable job of acting in this one. If you like gore
0, complete disappointment: It seems that the author does not understand what someone getting this book would want. To begin editing. I am not a rank amateur
1, Swing at it's Best: Swingerhead does a great job in their first cd. The music and lyrics are original and keep you hopping. The title track song : She could be a Spy will have you tapping your feet and singing along in no time. Lifts the spirits
1, A voice that takes you back in time.: The best swing band you will hear. I've seen them live in Florida
0, Poorly Manufactured: My six pound little Pomeranian was able to pull the stitching apart on this ball within a matter of 5 minutes. When my wife sewed the ball back together
0, Used to be better...: For what it is
1, book: I didn't receive my book until 10 days after I was suppose to get it. This will weigh on my future purchases.
0, Great disappointment from Great painters series: Being great Roerich fans and being that there is so precious little available in print
0," Some simplistic ideas: Simplifying taxes is a trap that every tax reformer falls into. Unfortunately I can tell you from having worked in the taxation field that the ""simpler"" the taxes"
1, A step away from having someone over your shoulder.: Unfortunately

0, Not Happy: I didn't realize this product would be automatically renewed. I've asked that this renewal be cancelled and my money refunded and was told it would be done. that was several weeks ago and still no refund.
0, TERRIBLE customer service: Self is okay. I chose not to renew because of the customer service. They would send me multiple issues
1, nice kit for making homemade dog biscuits!: When you want to really show your pet your love...make home made dog biscuits! This kit is perfect
1, A Great man's great book: After reading this book I have so much respect for Jim Corbett. He truly was a gentleman and a big-hearted at that. He had so much respect for the native people he lived with. Throughout his stories he gives credits for others and never to himself. Although he hunted all alone and on foot
1, Reading at it's finest.: After reading Jim Corbett's works
1, In Defense of Geddy AND Alex: From the first time you hear Ged's voice on this album you immediately think you're listening to a Rush album. However
1, Geddy's headache: For half the (bassists) universe
0," This CD is a ""headache!"": Geddy Lee should stay in Canada and stop making stupid records"
1, A brilliant re-introduction to soul: there is nothing neo about Ricky Fante's debut. If only today's r&b and soul musicians will pay respectful homage to the music of yesteryear
1, A Modern Mythology both strange and lasting: Sowa has slowly taken over my heart. Everytime I saw a postcard with one of his images on it I snapped it up but never sent it. Now
0, HORRENDOUS!: Tolkien's book is undoubtedly the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.Peter Jackson's films are a masterful and enthralling adaptation.Rob Inlglis's unabridged narration is a worthy and thoroughly enjoyable audio experience.But this 'dramatization' is so horrendously awful that I couldn't even get through the first CD!The Hobbits sound like demented Chipmunks... Merry is voiced by a woman... Frodo is American... the narrator sounds like an Irish DJ... The list of atrocities goes on.I would love to cast this production back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. As it is
0, Just boring: I read this book because everybody told me that the movie was excellent
0, Puzzling
0, setting?: I had heard about this book that the plot was slow
0, One man's bread...: ...is another man's poison. Before I get flamed by rabid Tolkien fanatics
1, Tolkien's Challenge: I believe that this story is J.R.R. Tolkien's test to himself as a writer. It was to see whether or no he could start from nothing and bulid up a whole new world for his audience to look at. He created lands
0," Self-indulgent fruitiness: The plot is some sort of Reluctant Everyman Hero Vs. The Easily Recognizable and Conveniently Centralized Ultimate Evil. The author really could have done better here. And what is with all this ""Tom Bombadillo-Hey!"" stuff? Man"
0, The Fellowship of the Ring: HORRIBLE...... I sure am glad they made a movie of it so I could understand the story line..... I had to listen to each CD about 3 times to follow it. Thank God for the movie because I knew some of the characters but trying to remember the names and places and what was going on and follow and remember who was who.... because after awhile the all sound alike
1, Epic
0, BORED of the Rings.: This book is definitely NOT all the hype that money can buy. I muddled through The Hobbit with about as much interest as a five-year-old at a lecture on world geopolitics
1," What an Adventure: This is the nexted book I read after the book before this ""The Hobbit."" To me it still had the adventure I've always wanted to read in fairy tales. I'll just tell you about the book just alittle to see if you would like to read this book. Bilbo has aged over the years since the last book. He's the towns hero ever since his mysterious disappearance and his remarkable return. He has brought alot of gold so he doesnt have to do anything and worry about anything. But since then people have bugged him and taking all his stuff! And people dont respect him as much. So when its time to leave he passes on his magical ring and all of his things to his cousin and heir Frodo. Then one of Bilbo's best friend the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to becareful because the ring has strong powers more powerful then he can imagine. So it is his turn to have the adventure. And he too will have hardships but will he have sucess? or will he perish? Thats your job to read the book and find out!"
0, Warning: The Two Towers is unavailable: As of this writing (Mar 2011)
1, Better than Harry Potter: I like this book because I like science fiction. It was pretty hard to follow because they used old english. My favorite part was when they had the party and Bilbo left
1, The Hobbit: The one that started it all! Join Bilbo Baggins as his wish for adventure binds all of Hobbylta to a quest to save Middle Earth. Tolkien created a world all his own that invites the reader to stay just a bit longer. If you haven't read it yet
1, Great book its like watching the movie with extra scenes: This book was great and had alot more too it then the movie but the movie was more concise and to the point which was good. Too many songs that get really annoying around page 130 when Tom Bombadil rescues them. After they get past that part the books action increases and you don't wan't to stop reading until they rest which happens alot in this book and its a good thing or else I would have read the book straight through until the end and wouldn't have savoured the flavor so to speek.
1, The Elves are the coolest!: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves of where The Hobbit ends. This book is where the real adventure really starts. This book is magic. I can't describe in words how much I love the Elves
1, The Best of the Three: I and many others will tell those of you who haven't read LOTR that if you were to read only one of the books
1, Obsession Started: I read this book after its first movie installment. Movie is not my passion and usually I watch movies after its peak period (when the price is slightly lower). This time the wave of The Fellowship of the Ring was taking the world like a hurricane. After deep thought
0, Get the hate mail ready . . . this book STINKS!: Tolkein is by far the most overrated author I have ever read! The meticulous attention to detail does not create vivid imagery
1, Highly Recommneded: The Lord of the Rings is an outstanding work that has defined the field of heroic fantasy for two generations. I would recommend it to anyone who loves narrative sweep
1, Wonderful Book: Tolkien continues to amaze me with his fluent sense of plot! There is not one dull moment in the tale
1, The beginning of fantasy: The first part of the trilogy that helped fantasy get where it is today. If you've seen the movies and not read the books
0, It's a Dramatization and the reviews are of something else
1, This book is a classic! The advice is right on!: I needed a copy of Getting Them Sober for a family trying to deal with an alcohol problem.This book has been around for a long time. The ideas are realistic and practical. Legitimate help! Besides
1, bravo to original cast: this cd is amazing. Mary Martin's voice clear
1, Mary Martin in THE SOUND OF MUSIC: Although the recording techniques were not as advanced as today
1, Perfect for my DJ setup: I was looking for a LARGE adjustable height table to accomodate for my dj setup
0, Where's my Kindle edition of Runner's World???: Only after taking my money for a Kindle Editon of Runner's World did I get notified that a print edition is coming instead.
0," ""Runner's Light"": Once you get past the fact that every single cover features some blond nobody runner in skimpy clothing and a perfectly airbrushed body"
1, Subscribed for years: My wife used to run more than she does now
0, Horrible customer service: While the magazine itself is okay if you are into running
0, Embarassingly Bad Magazine: The magazine is unbearable
0," distasteful storyline spoils book for me......: I guess I'm getting too jaded in my Romance reading but I'm sick of the ""hostage falls for her captor"" storyline. I just cannot drum up any positive feelings for a hero who has kidnapped a rival clan's laird's daughter and plans to ""deflower"" her"
0, Thought it would be good
1, Fast and Funny: The Loony Bin Blues moves along with gusto taking it's colorful characters to a satisfying climax. It's a fast read
0, Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!: One of the worst books ever. It read like a crazy Phantom phan's dream come true. The re-incarnated Christine was from the same place as the author and was also an actress
0, Ugh!: OK i loved her first book but this was just wrong! Keep in mind i love thing about rencartion but still it's worn! son't buy it please i'm diong you a faver DON'T BUY THIS BOOK TURN THE BACK BOTTON AND ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T SEE IT. I BEG OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i reluckdently gave this one star but it dosn't desever it.
0, This watch is TOO BIG: When people say this watch is big.. they mean REALLY BIG HUGE. Did I mention this watch is a Gigantic Super sized.. MEGLADON? This watch makes my SUV look small. Don't try paddling a kayak with this watch on unless you like making unintentional left hand circles. Additionally
1, it's all relative: Goes through Einstein's though processes
0, NOT THE SAME: Pampers has changed this diaper. I have been buying Pampers for 4 years and have gone through thousands of their diapers. I bought a box on Friday and could tell immediately that they were different. My dd has leaked through 6 of the 10 diapers we used from this box. The mesh liner that used to be in these is no longer there! We have tried to contact Pampers
0, 40% Price increase overnight!: This used to be a good deal for buying Cruisers (especially with the free shipping over $25). But now the price has jumped from $7.49 to $10.49 overnight. It is much cheaper to buy diapers at a local store.
1, good but expensive and still subject to blowouts: Still haven't found a disposable diaper that keeps the poo from going up the back. We tried the Cruisers because they were on sale. They are better-fitting than the baby dry and seem to be a bit easier to get him into as a result. I'm not sure that they're any more comfortable for him after the first five minutes
1, The best: Pampers are the best diapers in existence. They hold in everything they are supposed to
0, Cheaper at the grocery: These are $34.99 at Publix grocery store. Plus
1, Pampers are wonderful!!: I recently bought a couple packs of Huggies after seeing they were much cheaper than Pampers and I really miss the Pampers! They have a pleasant smell to them and are much softer than other diapers but still very functional.
1, Pampers are #1...don't settle for anything else: When it comes to diapers...it's just one of those things you can't skimp out on. Pampers cruisers are the best diapers out there. My 2 year old and 6 month old both use them. We tried every brand out there and these keep them the driest and work the best overall. It's not about the cost...just the quality. If you don't know which to buy...then these are the ones...easy as that!(Trust me...I'm a stay at home Dad with two kids under two...I've got the experience to tell you what's up!)
1, Cruisers/Amazon Rock: Cruisers are the best diapers
1, great product not so great service: Pampers are by far the best diaper if you have a large baby. However
1, Best diapers!: Pampers are the best diapers there are. I have used the Swaddlers and the Cruisers for both my sons
0, amazon box contains less than what you can get elsewhere: Pay careful attention to the number of diappers included in this value box! It is smaller than the normal box you usually get from other stores or from amazon
1, We love Pampers in our house.: My son
0, Price Increased by THREE DOLLARS: I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this! The Diapers are the best out there.
0, Quality has gone down like anything!!: Let me begin by telling you all I have always loved the pampers brand diapers. Since my son was born
1, Great price for these: Besides the fact that these are great diapers
0, terrible diapers!: Who designed the shape of Pamper diapers? I feel it is the worst shape for a diaper. Its tab is far blow waist position 
0, Voice cassette: I purchased a CD and an audio cassette of the movie Annie. This is a review of the cassette.If there were a no star rating
1, Annie: The CD I purchaced was of good quality and I received it promptly Amazon always have an excellent rating with me
1, Tansends Age: The content of this musical is little-kid though the story has the emotional depth that makes it not matter. The songs help tell the story in such a way that they condense emotions being felt by the characters
1, A quick read but contains plenty of helpful ideas on better usability: I liked the short format of the book and the easy to read style punctuated by touches of humor.This book has helped me redesign navigation of blog and as a result it has improved bounce rate (lower)
1," Very good book for the do it yourselfer: Everyone in our IT department that has anything to do with our products SDLC had to read this book. At first I was a little reluctant since it was ""required"""
1, Practical: A very accurate and realistic look at the sociology behind user interface development and philosophies on how to deal with it. I recommend this book to all of my front-end developers.
1," A ""Must Read"" for all Webmasters: This short"
1, Succinct enjoyable read: It's not often you finish a technical book wishing there was more to read

0, very poor: I ordered the remote #138 sensor with remote probe. Received 2 units withou the probe
1, One of the best!: I never read anything twice. I read this a long time ago and just read it again. I love everything that Stewart writes. This has just the right mix of fact and fiction
1, Waiting on God: On of the best Devotionals I read. I usually get bored with devotionals about half way thru. Not this time. I will read this book again and again. It gave me things to consider that I had not thought of before.Waiting on God
1," Great for New Readers: Nice big type and engaging pictures make this children's classic shine. It's a nice break from today's ""loud"" ""busy"" pages. A precious story sure to enhance your collection."

1, Kodak Easy Share Photo Printer: The first time that I used my photo printer I was amazed that the photo's came out so clear and DRY! The next week as I was in a local electronics store purchasing more processing equipment I saw a man in line preparing to purchase the same printer that I own and I told him that he would be more than satisfied with the results from the item he selected

0, Absolutely Awful: It's hard to understand how so many talented people can spend so much time
0, Not appropriate for children: Who approved this script for children!!???!! This is NOT a Dr. Seuss product at all! The jokes are inappropriate (should be for adults)
0, Ruined the book for me as well: Several years have passed and yet I'm still so upset about this movie that I can't bring myself to read the book to my kids.
0," This movie stinks!!!!!!!!!: I can't even begin to explain how terrible this movie really is.This really soils the charm of Dr. Seuss's legacy of children's books by turning the charmingly fun book ""The Cat In The Hat"" into a toilet humor comedy with absolutely disgusting stabs at gross humor and failing miserably at being funny.This is not for children to see by any stretch of the imagination.Even for those who aim to see brainless fun"
0," Where is the comedy?: This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen.The ""good"" review given by Jeffrey Lyons is a J-O-K-E.The acting and writing was A-W-F-U-L.At times I nearly fell asleep during the movie.In fact if you have trouble falling asleep at night"

1, The Guns of Navarone: I have to smile when I see people make so much of MacLean's lack of writing syle or prose or some predictability of the story. Come on folks
1," One of the best war adventure stories ever: I read this book when I was in 10th grade and thought it one of the best books I'd ever read - I later read the author's ""HMS Ulysses"" which is even better - and still feel that way almost 40 years later. It is one of the best-written"

1, Very good value for the money: Good articles. MJ has lots of ads
1, Interesting: The main articles are pretty interesting. I wish the rest of the articles would have more detail though. I like this magazine
1, Prevention Magazine: I've been reading Orevention for 9 years and it never disappoint me. It has useful information about health as well as fitness. It has a small pocket size which is convinient if you want to take it with you.
1, Prevention Magazine: I believe Prevention to be a great magazine. Rodale has some great magazines
0," Waste of Money: I just received the June 2011 issue with Terry Hatcher on the cover. Good god. Yet another whiney #@$ actress triumphing over health problems. In her case they were completely preventable had she excercised proper safety precautions--like don't wear Uggs when you climb a ladder to do painting. The article starts off in the first sentence describing her as ""accident prone""!!!It isn't just this issue"
0, Interesting tidbits here and there ... but not worth it: I used to love this magazine a few years ago but was disappointed to find out
0," Not the Prevention I grew up with: I read Prevention growing up and into young adulthood. Some years ago it switched into a type of fluffy ""stereotypical"" womens' type magazine with similar ""health"" stories to the Globe or Enquirer (E.g."
0, Can't seem to find any articles...: I used to get this magazine several years ago and thought it offered alot of useful information - Currently
1, okay: A year subscription was only $2.00 from Amazon since I bought certain items. Worth the $2 but I wouldn't pay any more for this mag. Good info but it is the same every month.

1, halfway between a 3 and a 4: This album deserves a 3.5 it has some good songs on it and some songs that are just there....the macy gray songs are great as with the first and last track...if your a fan of mobys stellar album play you might want to pick this cd up because it has a few good ambient songs however if your looking for upbeat dance songs like the hits from his previous albums this album wont please you to much. but wont terribly disappoint you
1, Hot
0, Poorly made: Do not buy this product. I ordered it before reading the reviews and am sad to report that mine was also defective. The ipod plug is poorly made
1, very informative: Educated me a lot of cholesterol and how it all works I used this with the cholesterol counter book to lower my cholesterol in a reasonable time and kept it down for years.
1, Columbia Cougar Flats Tent: The tent
1, One of the Best True Adventures: Like many
0, This book is small: I was expecting a full size hard cover and got a mini me hard cover book. Paid a hard cover price. Should have went to Barnes and Noble. Will next time.
0, Not worth the money: I purchased this subscription for my now 4 year old boy. He loves the idea that he gets a magazine
0, Madonna is so much better!!!!!!!: Madonna and Britney shouldn't even be put in the same senstence; Madge is the Queen of Pop and Britney . . . well . . . she is the Plastic Barbie Doll of Pop. This song is unremarkable. Lyrically
0, Me against the music - the name says it all: I'm glad to see that Britney Spears has at least publicly acknowledged that she has been waging a war against music. It's still too early to see if good music will win out
1," There's a Reason Why its a Classic.: Bram Stoker's classic novel ""Dracula"" recounts the tale of the many people who come to interact with the terrifying Count. Jonathan Harker"
1, What Started It All In The West: I really like this book. It can be a bit hard to read sometimes but I think it's great. It's hard to remember how much differences there are in the book and in Bela Lugosi 's film. The one thing I all ways found striking is the physical traits. I mean really what a change.This is the best introduction to vampires. Really one of the great stories on the mythical creatures.
0, Bit of a Drag: I read this before I read Dracula In Love (which I loved and recommend) because I wanted to be up on the storyline of Mina. The first part was interesting but I basically skimmed more than 50% of end because it was so boring. The endless descriptions and flowery language was tiring to slog through.My impressions:Ladies are Madonnas or whores and being touched by a vampire automatically puts you in the latter category.Good
1, Got what i payed for: The book is in great condition for what i payed for it and I'm happy with it. No complaints.Thanks guys!
1, :-)): I have always wanted to read this book and i am very happy that i did. It is as very good story and worth the time to read
1, Great addition to library: Good book
0, Have yet to finish it.: After owning the book for three years
0, Very poor: Lines of the text not properly aligned on page of my Kindle. Doesn't seem to be a list of chapters at beginning.
1, It wasn't too scary to read: I was hesitant to read the book because I didn't want to have nightmares based on movies I had seen. I really enjoyed the book. I had a hard time putting it down and found it to be a wonderful classic.
1, Dracula
1, Dracula: I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well
0, not sure I would trust this seller: We orderd a book from this seller and waited the 20 days they said it would take to deliver. After 23 days with no book I contacted the seller and they said they werent sure what was going on and could not even give me shipping information on the product. They did say they would expedite one out the next day but could not because of a negative review I gave them. They asked for me to remove review so they could ship the book
0, Get it Free Elsewhere: Why is this even listed? This short work is in the public domain and can be found for free elsewhere on the internet. I suspect Amazon is just inflating its Kindle books count by including works like this.Put it on you Kindle for free elsewhere.
1, Gothic and beautifully written: Beautifully written in 19th century prose--atmospheric
1, Really enjoyable: This is a really enjoyable book and parts of it are as impactful as it must have been when it was new. I liked the format of telling the story through letters
0, Don't waste your money on this...: Delstar makes some neat gadgets and they are very inexpensive. This MP3 player is loaded with features
1, Silly Fun: This is a well done very silly farce. Put your brain in neutral and just enjoy it. It has several groups of people all focusing on one train
1, Beautiful: This is one sexy piece of lingerie. It looks great
1, flows
0, Rosie is not that thin!!!: Rosie's face is so obviously airbrushed it makes me sick. They got rid of at least one of her many chins! If celebrities are trying to suck money out of my pocket
0, Travel 50 & Beyond Subscription - bad deal: I have never received a copy of this magazine that I ordered in August of last year! They didn't hesitate to take my money though! I have no idea if the magazine has any redeemable articles in it at all.
0, Ugly to watch
0, Disappointed in product!!!: I tried this hose and it is not for anyone who plans to use it often. The ends are very cheap plastic and easily strip if you take the hose off and on the faucet constantly (manufacturer does not recommend leaving it attached to faucet if not using). It does not roll up as easily as portrayed on tv and is easily punctured and cannot be repaired.
1," Koffi Means Business!: Koffi Olomide's Orchestre Quartier Latin's ""Force de Frappe"" retains the flavor that made the band famous. Recall the days of ""Magie"
1, Works great: It is nearly impossible to get those waterproof watch backs off with out this tool. Definitely a needed item if you want to change your own batteries and save tons of $$
1, A must for anybody interested in black-footed ferrets.: An excellent book
1, Best cover for you litter maid box: This probably the best cover you can get for the littermaid box. Fits well and still provide enough privacy. My cat had adjusted to it within a few days.
1, Very enjoyable read: I really enjoyed reading this western novel. The story is told from the perspective of a young impressionable cowboy
1, Fun cowboy book: This book was exactly what I needed: a nightly escape from legislative session. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it. The characters will stick with you.
1, Gift for a friend: This book was unavailable in the stores and/or libraries herein Tucson. What a find. Great service and product. Recommend this site for future purchases.
1, The Cowboy and the Cossack: I'm a voracious reader (not particularly of Westerns) and this book
1, Not perfection
0, Not For Me: This scent is overpowering to me
1, Cried a lot
0, Fun
1," Nice pop-up for kids or collectors: This 20-page (10 layouts with 10 ""pop ups"") book has a question on the left page and the movable piece that reveals the answer on the right. Topics are bug based and include Santa Bug"
0," No lights and music.: Usual fun ""Bugs"" book except back cover is suppose to have ""Lights and Music"". HOWEVER"
1, Last page doesn't work ...: My 16 year old nephew enjoyed this book so much when he was young that I wanted to buy it for a new nephew to enjoy. The pop ups throughout the book were just as I remembered them ... but his favorite part of the book was always the last page
0, Bugs without a song: I bought this book as a gift because my kids had loved it so when they were little. The highlight of the book is the end when the star lights up and plays a christmas song. I was very disappointed to find this mechanism was not working.Better to buy this one in the store where you can be sure all the pages work as they should.
0, Only OK: If you are looking for amazing pop-ups buy the Robert Sabuda books. The push-pull-pop-up features in this book are pretty plain and unexciting. Perhaps very small children will be entertained but my five- and six-year-old were bored. The final page with music and blinking lights on the Christmas tree weren't enough to make them want to read it again.
0," Yucky sheets: I was very unhappy with the fact that the dots on these sheets are ""painted"" on. The paint is a rubbery"
1, flowmaster muffler for 97 4runner: Fits well on my 97 4runner inlet and outlet matched perfectly
1, quality & size: I've had Tamarac Mocs for a long time.....They have been very comfortable and long wearing. I just recently bought a pair of the slippers reviewed here. Both styles are very high quality.Sizing was a little tricky with the slippers.... I wear a Sz 12 men's shoe and assumed from other purchases
0," when ""weird"" means ""incomprehensible"": Harlan Ellison has written some many memorable"
1, All leaders should read this.: Patton' memoir of his role in WWII. Written shortly before his death in Dec 1945 and published by his wife. Patton example of leadership is applicable to all leaders and all leaders would benefit by reading this book. Appended to this book are copies of Patton's general orders for the conduct of the 3rd Army in Europe which includes some very good practical advice for the fighting soldier and commander.
1," Plucked from the Fire: I am so excited about Plucked from the Fire. I have already recommended it to several people. This book has inspired me beyond what I can explain in words. Cheers to Bill and Stanley for the wonderful way they layed out this book and for sharing such an amazing story. It's an absolute ""must read""! Whoever reads it will be blessed. blessed."
0, Lies and Untruths: I worked with this HOLY? gentlemen for a number of years. This is like melting down the steel of the towers and selling it for profit. Yes he may have been rescued by Brian Clark but according to Clarks' account
1, Stunning Pictures: This collection of photographs are stunning
1, Tiffen #1: I love Tiffen
1, for travelers who value creature comforts: Several years ago I had a job where I traveled a lot for work. This experience made me choosy about where I stayed
0, Poorly Written: This book was poorly written. The author's thoughts meandered in chapters that barely focused on any main point. Definitely not something to recommend to someone who is a skeptic regarding co-sleeping. Although it deserves respect for pioneering on writing on the subject
0," Smut!!!!!!!!: Those Versace Ads displaying female frontal nudity disgust me!!!Although my husband likes ""Vanity Fair"" I have to make an extra effort to keep it away from our children who might confuse it for a smut rag with those Versace Ads!!!!!!!"
1, Great magazine: I would disagree slightly to say that this magazine engages in celebrity gossip. Yes you might read something with a different perspective on a certain person than you normally see
0, Liked it when she got it: Ordered my wife a subscription last christmas.Recieved 2 issues
0, Beware; RENEWAL SCAM!!!: This is my very first negative review on Amazon -- or anywhere else
1, HARD RO PUT DOWN!!: Excellent magazine
0, Never Arrived: I ordered this magazine subscription on December 15. It is now February 11. Have not received one magazine yet. FURIOUS.
0, You're serious?: How do you expect me to review a product which I haven't received yet? No I don't HATE this magazine
1, greaqt buy: Love warehouse deals and the products I buy. Cant find a better deal anywhere else. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get a deal.
1, You have to be into it: You have to be sure miracles coincide with the word of God. What I did like about this documentary was the desire of the youth to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
1, Finger of God: This DVD was absolutely amazing! The miraculous healings and the hunger that the people had for the supernatural far surpassed anything I had ever expected from watching this film.The clips of Heidi Baker astounded me.... I've never seen such love and compassion expressed by one person. I would purchase any film Darren Wilson makes. God has truly gifted this man to fulfill a prupose in capturing the glory of God throughout the world.I commend Darren Wilson on creating such a pure and honest film. It truly shows that God will show up anywhere in the world where people are desperate for His presence.
1, Great for the price.: Compared to the other filters i have owed this one is much higher quality that the others. I believe as a whole tiffen makes better products that sunpak. I will most likely be buying these when they go on sale again.
1, Not bad for the price: I bought this filter as part of a package with a UV and a warming filter through Amazon. They're all Tiffen thought the Polarizer is what I really wanted.In use I can see difference in colour saturation especially in blue skies which actuall gained a richer contrast from the white clouds. On the downside
0, its OK for the price...: Very poor build quality... my ring was shaking/rattling... and its extremely prone to attracting dust... gives u decent amount of contrast... probably u get what u pay for i guess....apart from that the biggest problem was the treads are too tight and rough... was a pain putting it on and getting it off my lens...but as i said its really really affordable and give u fair amount of contrast in ur pics... just wish build quality was a bit better.
0, polarizing filter: This filter doesn't do much of anything. I should have listened to the reviews. JUNK Save your money for a better one.
0, Does not fit the Panasonic camera: ALthough it is specified by Panasonic
0, Works?: The item shipped quickly and worked well for one week then would not sound tone unless receiver was within 25 feet of sender.
0, Only worked intermittently: We installed this on a metal door of a retail establishment. Apparently the metal interferes with the radio frequency. We were told to put small pieces of wood between the door and the unit
0, Not all parts were shipped: This looks like great fun
0, not a very good series: The Sheridan series is pretty weak. V.A. Stuart is no Bernard Cornwell. The author knows her history well enough
0, Wood glue failed immediately - you might try a different version of this toy: A perfectly fine Soma cube (bit small but whatever)
0, Cheap Truck: I bought this truck for my 2 year old. He ends up crying everytime he tries to play with it. The sides of the truck do not stay on no matter how I try to secure them. He gets very frustrated when the sides fall off.The boxes in the back are cheap cardboard and not durable at all.The sounds the truck makes are very short. The box indicates there is a demo mode
1, Good protection for your lens: Ever since I got into digital photography
1, Doesn't make a difference to my photos
1, Great protection: Bought this for Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens
1, Recommended addition for FZ28: Works very well with our Lumix as a protective filter. It makes us more comfortable when using the camera.
0, Absolutely not what I expected!: I had purchased this along with my 50mm f/1.8 mkII thinking that it would protect everything well and improve my photos. While it did do a good job protecting
1, Don't buy on promo: The filter was susposed to have been free with the purchase of a $400 lens but was charged on the invoice. Don't buy.
1, Does what it is supposed to: Protects the lens. Great price. Sturdy build. Worth the few bucks to add protection to the camera lens. Nice buy.
1, Good protection and resonable filter: Had my little boy break the first one of these. Saved the lens. I have had the filter in one condition show some lines with light at a certain angle but it was inside so I just removed the filter in that condition. Not sure if the higher quality filters would not have had that or not. But in regular outside use
1, solid protection: The product is well made and would for sure protect a lens from breakage but it is not coated to prevent secondary reflections.
0, broken: The inside case was crashed while the outer box is perfect
0, disappointed: I am disappointed with the service. The filter came to me with amount of dust on both sides.
0, Sensetive: Well I got this item last week. I finally took out of the packaging it was in at a photo shoot I was doing . When I took it out of the packaging I dropped it by accident and it was shattered.
0, causes lens flare: haD TO TAKE IT OFF AS THE LENS FLARE WAS RIDICULOUS...I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT ...pay a little more get something better
0, You get what you pay for: The build quality is terrible! The glass is loose inside the ring and has lots of imperfections. Completely useless.
1, Excellent filter - great price ! Must have for FZ18 users!: I purchased this filter through Amazon/Adorama for my FZ18k - primarily to protect the front element of the zoom lens. The filter was delivered in it's own case and the packaging is much better than many other brands that I have used in the past. The quality of the glass is good. I have not noticed any distortions in photos takes with the filter. It is a great buy to protect your zoom lens!
1, It is what it is! And it's a MUST HAVE accessory.: A UV filter is simply a must have. I bought 2
0, Decent for protection: I bought it without doing much research. The filter isn't coated
1, Happy - as expected: Seller was prompt and item arrived without any problems and as described. I use it primarily to protect my 50mm Canon lens
0, Read Gatorvalenz first - NOT FOR WIDE ANGLE: I (foolishly) purchased this filter to place upon a Tokina 12 - 24 mm Nikon lens
0, Plastic Threading comes off: I bought this because it was cheap. I kept it on the camera all times. When I screwed in a cheap SEIKOS 82mm polarizing filter
1, Does its job: I bought this as a cheap way to protect myCanon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras
1, Tiffen 58: The filter was a good price and the one I received had no artifacts that appear in my photos. A good investment to protect your camera lens.
1, Great filter
1, Tiffen UV Protection Filter: Great
0, Never got the item: Never got my item
0, Go for Hoya: I purchased this or rather say got it FREE with Nikon d40 promotion and I was really upset with the picture quality I was getting from Nikon d40 with this filter on
1, Nice Filter: I have used Tiffen filters before and never had a problem. Better spending money of a filter then scratching and expensive lense..
0, It does its final purpose.: The protector comes with kind of tiny spots on it. It does protect the lens from scratches and fingerprints
0," UV LENS BOUGHT WITH 5 D MARK II: THIS WAS ON THE SAME PAGE AS MY 5D MARK 1I AS SAYING ""CUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BOUGHT THIS"" AND SINCE I WANTED A UV FOR THE NEW CAMERA I CHECKED IT. IT WAS THE WRONG SIZE AND I WENT ON A FOUR WEEK TRIP WITHOUT PROTECTION FOR MY NEW 24-105 LENS. WHICH I LOOKED FOR ALONG THE TRIP BUT COULD NOT BE FOUND . I WAS STEAMED."
1, Cheap
0, Not multi-coated so it will actually detract from pictures: Multi-coated lenses help reduce reflections off the filter glass
1, IT'S OK. PERFECT: There is nothing to tell about this product. I've bought only to protect my nikkor lens. It fits fine and arrived in a protected case.
1, excellent: Since I wear UV protection lotion
0, Worth it for the money......: ....since it was free. The filter does not appear to have any coatings
0, not a great filter: I bought this filter to protect a Canon EF 85mm/f1.8. It does the job
0, tiffen filter: filter is ok..I get a lot of reflection on the pics taken with flash or if bright lights are in the background( Christmas lights etc)
1, inexplicably good: I'm afraid this is one of those films that you just have to see. No attempt at paraphrase or rhetoric can add to what's already there on the screen. You might want to talk about the technical features
1, Great boots
1, please change the title. it's a typo.: withness? WITNESS!!Music itself is no doubt good.but when i try to search for this album
0, Expected so much more!: I love Sophie Kinsella's books and thought I would enjoy one with her as Madeleine Wickham

0, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.: Well firstly
1, Dylan's Review: So far this has been a great book.It was about a girl that saw a rabbit he was very late for something.Alice wanted to see what he was late for so she folled him into his rabbit hole.And she kept folling him.This is my review.
0, So delightful!: My first read. Just as charming at age 58! I shall now read Looking Glass and enjoy Carroll's imagination and puns!
0, Great story. Bad book.: I LOVE Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. However
1, Alice in wonderlans: It was so great I couldn't stop reading it it is a 10 star raiting.I loved it so much you should read it I think u would love it
0, Constant erros with the kindle version: I have to keep flipping back to the non illustrated version because the type is messed up on this version.
1, Always a pleasant surprise: I'm always amazed when I finish reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland how I feel like I just read the transcript of a dream.Everything is nonsensical
1, Master Illustration meets Alice: It is wonderful to discover another classic of children's literature illustrated by Robert Ingpen. It is a beautiful book. Even if you already own another copy or other copies of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
0, Nonsense: I never read this book as a kid. My familiarity with the story stems mainly from the Disney adaptation and general knowledge. The Kindle version of the book was free
1, Review of a review from an Innocent ex-TX Death Row Inmate: I read the review by the jealous
1, Excellent: It's difficult to obtain in the US
1, One of my favorite bands: I don't have anything to add to the 5-star reviews here; I just wanted to get my 5 stars on the record to balance out the 1-star people who failed to appreciate a truly great CD.
1, best album and song: i like this album because sing for absolution songs plase buy the original album and listen that song.check it out
1, cd of the decade absolutly: one of the best cd's of all time in my opinion I cannot get enough of this cd I can keep in on loop and never get tired of it. each song is so full of wormth and emotion I simply cannot get enough.
1, wow: this is a great record. glad I bought it.I've never really listened to Muse before
0," Riding the crest of his prior success--a disappointment: ""The Bones of the Master"" is a highly-accomplished book and well deserving of the highest accolades. Mr. Crane's subsequent volume ""Beyond the House of the False Lama"" rides the crest of this prior success"
0, Weak clippers: These shears are totally overpriced for their performance. I bought these on sale at $55 and would never pay the msrp at $70. They made my shih tzu's fine hair look like I cut it with my eyes closed- completely chewed it up and made it uneven
0, Waste of Money: I've had issues with this clipper since I bought it. This is the same one that horse supply catalogs offer.The battery only lasts one muzzle and a maximum of four fetlocks before it dies. You can't run it off of the power cord
1, Good but not Kamelot's best: This CD is good
0, Mediocrity at best: I have heard sooooooo many things about Kamelot
1, If only there were more: This is the last book released by Mr. Hughart. It was supposed to be the third in a series of seven
0, Free Is Not Always Good: I feel silly complaining about something that is free
0, Horrible formatting - find a different version: Good gravy
0, Quiet and missing the mark: While the music is well written
1, What a perspective!: Loren has a great perspective on raising a family that is really worth sharing. I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to be exposed to her wisdom.
0, Not that much there.: I was actually disappointed with the magazine. When I started getting it I thought it would have lots of articles on how to write
0, Does not play: It's an mp3 player that does not play mp3s.Mine does not play at all. No sound. Nothing.I hooked it up to my computer
0, Nothing but fluff: This magazine is nothing more than Cosmo for men. How to make your sex life better
0, Maxim has Fallen so Far!: I have been a subscriber for 10 years. I will not renew. The magazine has changed completely. It is all filler and puff pieces. No interesting articles. Stick to Playboy for those. I think their staff truly believes in their own hype.
1, Not just hot woman
1, Maxim magazine at a great price: If you are a Maxim subscriber
0, Used to be Good
0, Would be nice if I got an issue regularly: The subscription started out without any issues
0, never got the subscription: I paid for this subscription over 2 months ago and have yet to receive a single issue?? So
0, Charged twice when u order!!!: Im not sure why but the price says $5.00 but they charge your account 2 times for $5.00.... Amazon has yet to tell me why!!!
0, Unimpressed: This magazine was extremely disappointing. It'a a mish mosh of junkie
0, I haven't got my magazine yet: I never received a copy of this magazine i am still waiting on my first issue.
0, Still haven't gotten it yet.: I ordered this magazine on 8/12/09 - it is today 9/12/09 and I have yet to even receive one issue. Way to go Amazon... or Maxim - whoever managed to screw this up.
1, Maxim Delivers: The subscription delivers exactly what is promised. I gave it as a gift and luckily they also received the year end issue along with an extra holiday supplement issue. It's all fun enjoyable reading that comes straight to his address.
0, Disappointed: This phone was great for about the first 6 months of owning it and actually we have two handsets. On both handsets the #1 buttons stopped working then the HOLD buttons stopped working. A couple of months later the #2 and #3 buttons stopped working on one handset
1, READ THIS BOOK IF...: You are interested in nature or you are interested in Jane Goodall. It's a very informative book and at the same time that it is telling you about jane Goodalls life work
1, Well made filter?: I replaced a filter that I bought at a parts store due to what I thought was poor construction where the two halves were not glued or melted together very well...with the possibility that the filter might suck air...a no-no for your transmission. This filter has a metal ring crimped around the two halves so there is little chance of air getting into the filter.
0, Ex-Colored Man: It said no highlighting
0, Loud and ineffectual: I was surprised that it really didn't do much compared to the 1950s version that I'd inherited. Keeping a wet wash cloth next to my bed for when I start coughing in the middle of the night works better.
1, Review: It took me a few pages to get into this book
0, Terrible
0, poorly executed text: This textbook is a mess. It is not elegant or clear
0," Worst book I ever read: I would have rated ""0 stars "" if poosible in the selection.Since this is the textbook for my course I have to deal with this book. The way things are mentioned in this book I doubt whether the authors have even understood the concepts right. I think that the authors themselves are confused while writing this book.If this book is for your course"
0, A clean text dump
0, Terrible Textbook: I am 3rd year undergraduate student and just finished taking a class that requires this book. This book was so unhelpful in trying to do assignments or even understand the text. As a matter of fact you will be in chapter 8 trying to reference an algorithm in chapter 1. You end up spending to much time trying to find information that is not even in this book.This book is GARBAGE!!!!! If your professor requires this book. Drop the class immediately!!!! I feel this book is an insult to any professor who teaches Design and Analysis of Algorithms!!!Someone needs to ask the authors if we all can have our money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0, Garbage: This desk is a piece of junk. The silver paint on it was streaked and showing metal. Some metal was rusted. When assembling
0, Boring!: Ann didn't do a very gbood job on keeping my attention. She went into way too much detail and there were many times that I just completely lost all interest in reading it. It just keep going and going. The only good part about this book us the topic on black and white relations. I'm sure that there is a little truth to this.
0, Review: I gave this book two stars because I am not big on reading books that include every detail of every second. I realie that when writing fiction books you must show a lot of detail to make the reader feel as though it is a real place or time but
0, Duplicate product: Please do not purchase this product. The product i received is not the original Hugo Boss. Hugo fragrance lasts long and the fragrance of the product i received does not even last for 10 minutes. Amazon does not even have a return policy for perfumes.
1, Feels Good To Smell Like A Boss: I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways
0, buyer beware - fake product: I have bought may perfumes from amazon before

1, kick ass cd everyone should own this: great cd but not as many good songs as a boy named goo. but the good songs are great
1," I cant stop playing this CD!: This is my first Goo-Goo Dolls CD. I bought it because Ive been hearing ""Slide"" and can't get the tune out of my head. Well...Id have to say that I love almost every song on this CD. And I had no idea Black Balloon was by this group. Im still rockin to Slide"
1, They've got me hooked: I never liked the Goo Goo Dolls
1, Good Film!: Acting was great. I didn't understand the story line but maybe it was great in the time it was made. I did enjoy the novie and will watch it again.
0, I am dismayed: I am a beginner
0, Book review: Found it unrealistic - no friend would want to partner for all the exercises together. Found it wafty and boring
1," Best magazine for truely adult women: No young twigs here - the models and the featured people are all over 40 and look realisitically fantastic. They even have articles on ""regular"" women who have done etraordinary things. This is about having our best life at this age"
1, Solid Product: This works exactly as I had hoped. It's simple
0, Another foul language Christian movie: This was a great story and it would have been one of my better DVD's in our Christian collection if it were not for the cussing. I really do not understand these film makers. For a movie like this there only audience is going to be Christians
1, Simply the best: These are the best active wear socks I have ever worn. They fit great and are warm on cold days. They wash and dry to the same great fit. But best of all
0, PURE GARBAGE!: No one disagrees with the fact that reading fairy tales to children can teach them valuable life lessons. That is where Bettelheim should have stopped when writing this book. His ultra-Freudian persuasion leads him way off course with this work. The sexually explicit meanings he claims young children can identify in fairy tales is nothing short of ridiculous. If it were
1, absorbing: I am a counsellor working with children. This book enables me to help children to tell their experience in story form. It is much easier for example for a child to talk about the mean witch that robbs the princess of beautiful things than attempt to say my grandmother is mean and wants the beautiful things for herself. Bruno's insightful way of linking the fairy tales with the unconscious material the child may be processing I find truly absorbing and enchanting myself.
0, Get the Mobi Tyke Light instead: I have had to write to the company for a new charger twice after these lights stopped working for no reason. The Mobi light is a much better
1, Comic is awesome!: This is a very graphic comic but its a great read for anyone who loves this series. My fiance is a big fan and he enjoyed it!

1, Awsome Set: This is the best set of DVDs I've ever purchased. I grew up with this type of program. I do recommend for you to purchase it
0, missing episode: we love these shows but for some reason episode 33 'its majic' gets skipped over in the 1st season. we tried it in our other players and it still skips right over it. anyone else have this problem?
1, Guilligan's Island Season 1: Loved the stories - they brought back memories! Only complaint was that there was no way to fast forward a story or skip to the next episode on these DVDs. Kind of annoying to have to watch from the beginning each time!
1, Gilligan's Island: DVD: The DVD set is in black and white which I didn't expect
1, Gilligan's Island set: Everything I expected

0, Peter the Great: I expect to get this book as I saw it to be sold with nice paper cover and nice picture on it.When I get it - it was hard cover only. Paper cover was lost or just didn't exist as shown on a website.
0, If these are the best
0, no use for it: Not as described.Thought would be able to use for teaching defensive driving here in Georgia but not able to use.
1, Great series for KIDS!!!!!! (dont forget): My son
1, Underpants: This book is really good and I think every one should read it. It is well suited for ages six and up .It would put you in a good mood because Captain Underpants makes you laugh. His job is to save people and get people out of trouble. He is like a comical superman.
1, A wonderful and concise textbook on the subject...: A wonderful introduction to Christian Spirituality
0, stay away from this Z-grade torture-porn rubbish: Do not get fooled by the cover. The sets look cheap. The actors do not even have any acting talents except when they are dead. Throw away the logical aspect of life and you get this movie!!! Avoid at any costs!
1, NOT BAD: GOOD SERVICE-GOOD MOVIE.ALWAYS HAD GOOD SERVICE WITH AMAZON AND PRODUCTS I HAVE ORDERED HAS ALWAYS CAME ON TIME AND IN GOOD SHAPE.
1, A concise look at Rome's History: Marcel Le Glay et al's History of Rome was the first History book on Rome I read. The book was relatively well written

1," Don't ignore the less obvious cuts...: ...in favor of the chart or AOR hits. Like I did when I first bought this album in vinyl. I mentally tuned out ""Black Cow"" as I waited for ""Peg"" for its top-40 exposure or ""Deacon Blue"" for its appeal to the fusion fan in me. But ""Cow"" is a plain-spoken funk number about a decadent lover done in the 16th-note shuffle that was to stand Fagen in good stead through both of his solo works. Not to mention the fact that there's an elegantly understated Rhodes piano break in the middle worthy of anything by Hancock or Corea. When I upgraded to CD"
1, I'm only going to say one thing about this LP: And that is that many recording engineers use it to check the quality of the monitor setup in their studio
0, unwatchable film quality: This is an excellent adaptation of the classic short story
0, Extremely Disappointing: This 64-page book is very shallow and provides no in-depth analysis. The author relies heavily on the works of Les Grau and the writing he had done on the Soviet-Afghan War. There is very little discussion of the current conflict and the use of caves by the Taliban or Al Qaeda. More than half of the book contains current pictures from the U.S. Army
1, And Still the Earth: I read _And Still the Earth_ as a teenager
1, Excellent Book: A book that every guitar player must have
1, well written: this book is well written and simple. I've dabbled with the guitar for a long time and decided to pick it up again recenty. I purchased this book and went through it page by page

1, An epic: Oates has written an epic story of the Mulvaneys
0, Infuriating!: What a horrible book. I have to finish any book that I pick up but I almost didn't make it through this one. What was Oprah thinking? I wish I had seen her show when they discussed it because I truly want to find something redeeming. What a waste of time - I could have been reading a good book!

0, The Emporer's New Clothes: This is an award winning book
0, I sure hope the movie's better than the book.: What a sorry book to read right after I read Cold Mountain. I'm sorry
0, This book is popular because it's about slavery: I didn't think this book made much sense. It was hard to follow
0, I'm not sure...: I'm not sure if it was just because it was for a class and I had read so many fantastic novels before this one
0, Beloved: Yeah right: Ok
0, Overrated: Toni Morrison has a strong grasp of the English language in everything she has written that I've read. But in them all
0, Incredibly confusing: There was so much hype over this book
1, Memorable: This is a marvelous
1, Truely Beloved: I enjoyed reading Beloved. This does not happen much

1, 007 fans: i love all 007 movie i have all of them i rally loved every part of this great movie i think 007 rocks
1, Long last: At long last a DVD of On Her Majesty's Secret. Great quality. Now my 007 DVD collection is complete. I am very satisfied with shopping at Amazon.com. Personally believe this was the best James Bond filmed.
1, George Lanzenby did great: Although George Lanzenby only played James Bond once
1, another great bond movie: the only movie by lazenby
0, There is something wrong with this DVD: Seems like an illegal copy - won't play on my DVD player
0, Terrible Bond movie: This has to be the worst Bond of them all! (The only reason I even have it is because I got the complete Bond set and apparently you can no longer get them individually).Here's an example of how bad and unbeleavable the story is:in one instance
1, Arrived Quickly: This was the last DVD in the James Bond series my husband need to complete his collection so he was so happy to find it! He watched it right away! Thanks!
1, Great
0, Didn't last long before developing cracks/stains: We installed this sink in our new laundry room. Initially it looked good
0, No information.: Not in manufacturer's box
1, WELL BALANCED WITH FACTS AND FICTION! TRY IT!: THE BLACK KING
1, Good Tree for the money: Quality of this tree is good for the money. The size is what was really important to us and it is perfect.
1, Nothing less that Perfect!: The cd is great!! I'll say that 97% of the songs on the cd are listenable without irritation. His voice is amazing and MUCH better than some of the R&B artists that are out nowadays
0, Not what its worked up to be: I went out and got the CD on the first day it released after hearing So Sick and Stay- he knew which songs to release first. I am not happy I did. I am not feeling the CD at all. The radio keeps saying that it is hot and everyday I listen to it to see what I missed. I repeat Stay all the time as the other songs are not that great. I can tell which song he wrote for Mary because it is the same track as hers. Mirror is ok but the CD is not good. I would rather listen to my Marques Houston CD at least I like 4-5 songs on that CD. Like Chris Brown
1, One of a kind: Not many cd's can touch this. Only Joe
1, Ne Yo - In My Own Words: I bought this album because of one song - So sick
1, Favorite Ne-Yo Album thus far: I had Ne-Yo's last three albums (including R.E.D) but not the first two. I had purchased some songs from In My Own Words. I decided to buy the album. And OMG it is in my opinion his best album yet. My second fav is Year of The Gentlemen
0, what the funk is jay z thinking: def jam used to be a rap label now I see sorry singers taking over neyo sucks this is for those who like stupid annoying kids like chris brown
0, Lawrence Block wrote THIS?: It's difficult to believe that Lawrence Block could possibly have written this. Block creates one vivid character after another in his Scudder series (Walk Among The Tombstones and A Long Line of Dead Men are especially recommended). But he stumbles badly here.Tanner On Ice has it all: A rambling
1, A Tanner fan gives thumbs up to this one as well: I loved the book. I certainly agree that it requires a full suspension of belief
0, not durable: I purchased this product for my husband's birthday. Unfortunately
0, Absolute junk: I spent a great deal of time installing cameras for one of these DVRs (for home security) only to find out that the DVR did not work. Silly me
0, Swann = Lame Duck: This product only worked for about 6 months then just stopped recording. I think the hard drive is bad. I would not recommend this product.

1, Peake is great: Excellent stuff. The Gormenghast Trilogy is still the book you must read
0, I'm waiting for it: I can't review the book because I haven't received it yet. It's still in transit from the 20th December 2011 in CHICAGO IL US. When I'll receive it I will write how it is and if it respond to the description of the seller.
0, Less useful than my tiny 1958 paper dictionary: This dictionary is oversimplified. Many words have only a one-word definition. It may be okay for beginners.But worse
0, Never received item - terrible company to work with out of Poway: I never received this item. This was the second time that they haven't sent an order. They are based in Poway
1, JHUD RULES!: THANKS TO DREAMGIRLS
1, Dreamgirls-The Movie: I love the music and the new songs on this CD. It's great to see all of the talented folks shine on their own songs. This CD along with the original Broadway cast CD
1," An instant classic!: I'm honestly perplexed by the Amazon editorial review. ""Demo sound""? ""Tinny""? ""Spotty""? Sorry"
1, Comfortable - reading: I enjoyed the story of Carol Taggert and Lee Grafton
0, What is Life Worth?: After watching Mr. Feinberg being interviewed on television I was most anxious to read his book. It goes without saying that the topic is both fascinating and poignant. However
1," Hard hitting whithout being hard: (""I love heavy stuff...yet I love them too!) They were an opener for Thrice(along with the Bled"
1, Modern purpose built homes featured: Some of the houses are really stunning. A part of the problem is that many of the houses they feature are built as modern homes. In a recent issue they showed some old homes that were converted over. What I would like to see is them taking a colonial home and converting it. That being said its a very good magazine for people that like modern homes. There is appropriate advertising that can help you outfit your home. Most of the home items shown are not top dollar
0, Great eye candy
1, A great gift to yourself or a friend: Someone gave me this book at a very dark and dispair-filled time in my life. I was reluctant at first
1, Life Changing!: Under the right circumstances
1, Enjoyable Gay Gothic Romance Mystery: This book came up in my recommendations list
0, Chinese silverware: We were disappointed and had to return the set of stainless because the forkswere too heavy and large for normal persons to use. Evidently the discriptionand photos didn't show this. We appreciate your kindness in handling it.

1, Review Of Floorfilla Debutante Disc: The songs
0, Disappointment: I have $5 earbuds that sound better than these. I was hoping for an exciting new audio experience. sigh.Buy the Shure E series or Bose earbuds instead
0, Not Worth the Money: I was disappointed with these earphones. The sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated. The $30 Sony MDR-EX51 earphones I already owned sounded much better.
0, Disappointing: These earphones have an extremely long cord. So much so
0, Etymotic Research ER6 Isolator Earphones (Black): Sound quality not good had too replace filters fast. Noise canceltion is really good volume of sound not great
1, Very good book: Huxley's character portrayals are
1, One of the best and most inspiring books I've ever read.: Cardinal Bernardin is at peace with his life and approaching death. He teaches us through his words and actions how to graciously accept our world and God's plan for each of us in this world. A must read for those who have suffered the loss of a loved one
1, A Gift from Cardinal Bernardin: This book
1, Dan Fogelberg Live DVD: A tremendous artist gone too soon. This dvd has all the hits and sounds great. Wish I could get my hands on the DF Soundstage.
1, Hilarious!: I have read all the books and decided to try the shows after seeing that Hugh Laurie was in them. They are just great! It took me awhile to get the hang of their accents and to interpret some of the words that we don't hear often but once I did
1, I love Jeeves and Wooster: My wife and I like to dress up and have semiformal dinners. Frequently we will put our computer on the table so that we can watch Bertie and Jeeves. It adds to the magical moments of our lives.I recommend this series very highly.
1, Beautiful
1, I'm in it for the long haul with this one: Ever since I got this CD three weeks ago
0, Bring It On: I really had no intention of watching this movie but people kept telling me how funny it was and it came on a movie channel so I was like sure why not? Well unfortunately for me 'funny' never came. This movie had absolutely no funny parts or even parts that were semi appealing. It's about a cheerleading squad going to finals or whatever and one them is a bit grundgy and...is that it? I don't remember. Did I completely dislike this movie because I don't like chick flicks? Probably so but I did enjoy 'Legally Blonde' once it started rolling and got past the completely ridiculous beginning scenes (I guess the onces that were supposed to be funny). So yeah you might enjoy this movie if your into chick flicks or you just really wanna see alot of cheerleaders do flips and what have you but other than that I'd saty away from this one.
0, Terrible. Just a bunch of snooty girls: This film is awful. It is not appropiate for children at all. There is a lot of teen girls acting up in a sexual way and in a snotty way. One thing this movie is right about though is what cheerleading has been allowed to become in this country. Cheerleading is supposed to be about cheering. In this film and in reality today its a bunch of teen girls talking about sex
0, A bad Movie: This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. All there was was boyz. I wanted a movie with boys. If you want to hook up with me my phone number is 762-6605
0, Coffee table book: If you like books that have beautiful pictures
1, Grounding theory in real life examples: This book is a wonderful introduction to the rise and fall of the first movement for proportional representation voting systems in American municipal elections. As Barber details
0, Disapointing: This is great if your into Edgar Cayce. If your not into him
1, Missed it!: Man this brings back memories
1, I Shot Andy Warhol: This is an excellent flick with great performances by Lili Taylor and Stephen Dorff. Fans of indie-rock will enjoy seeing Yo La Tengo performing as The Velvet Underground at Warhol's Facory
0, A Drag to Watch: After the first 15 minutes I knew that the best part of the movie had past
0, Something is missing.............: Was it the bad acting
0, Wow

1, Wonderful Memories of long ago and far away: For someone who grew up in the days of World War II andits music

1, Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics & Integral Equations: Book came in excellent condition and was shipped quickly. Highly recommend this seller.
0, Excellent film
1, Great movie: Great movie if you into sexual jokes. It comes off as a guys type of movie but the end has a different twist.
1, Worthy Of Repeat Viewings: Ignore completely the terribly slanted review of the....... writer and the top of this page. This movie is laoded with side splitting scenes. Its basically a light-hearted looking at the scamming side of dating and each character is pretty darn hillarious. Over exaggerated yes but the diner scenes are cool and the scene where the sensitive musician enters Amanda Peet's apartment to find the other two guys fighting over her just tickles my funny bone pink! Then when the married guy approaches Amanda Peete in her apartment complaining that she broke up their guy bonding meetings is another great moment. The ending where Amanda Peete is holding court is a nice swerve as there are plenty of lady players out there. For a dose of fun pick this one up.
1," Slow but worth watching: I first watched ""The Jewel in the Crown"" about 25 years ago"
0, Working Class: Had not read F S Fitzgerald previously and was expecting a better read. The character development was great but found the story line lacking and the whole of it bland in the end.

0, Weak Effort From the Egyptian Diva: I have only had limited exposure to Natacha Atlas's unique and wonderful music
0, waste of time from a physicist: Shermes book is a boring
0, The feel bad movie of the century: Don't watch this movie if you're in a good mood because it will drag you right down into the depression that exists in this movie. It starts out great. People are happy

1, Beyond the scope of most who enjoy Hancock's other writings: Like so many other Hancock readers
0, A muddle of a book that does not know what it wants to be.: Looking at the title of this book and then reading it leaves one in total confusion. Is it about a Martian civilization that may have come to Earth? Is it about the need to be worried about killer objects in space? Is it about Mars being destroyed by such? Its hard to tell with the muddle Hancock creates. Sometimes yes
1, Working The Sweat: There is so much from classic acts that are just going on in the music and radio these days. Prince is no doubt definitely a perfectional example. His latest single still shows he has the classic feeling he used to have back in the 80's. Black Sweat

1, National security: This show left me very concerned with the way NASA handles national security and technology transfer issues.There are foreign people everywhere in this program. For instance at some point in the show
0," DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE TITLE: RACIST. This word summarizes the book. It's thoroughly anti-semitic. The author believes in the superiority of the ""Aryan Race"""
0, Old Fashioned Stereotypes: This devotional makes the assumption that the wife stays home and the husband goes to work. My husband and I found the frequent examples referring to this type of marriage to be very distracting to the actual content of the devotional.I suspect that many modern day couples where both spouses work out of the home and share responsibilites in the house would have trouble with this book.
1, Great conversation starter: Good book. We have read 9-10 of the lessons togehter. The best thing about reading these lessons is the discussion that we have afterwards. The stories are well written and evocative. Thanks Steve
1, Beautiful.....: I thought this movie was so beautiful. It was not a lesbian film that was just unecessary nudity and sex
1, Sent to a Friend: I looked over the book when I got it. From what I could tell it's all that I needed it to be. But it wasn't for me. I got it for a friend of mine who needed something like this. And she said it has been very helpful for her. That's all I needed to hear.
0, Too Many Inconsistencies: Save yourself $... and read the operations manual that came with your PC. I had to purchase this book for a college course on Operating Systems. It is written like a technical manual and will put you to sleep. The book is informative but there are several inconsistencies

1, Why do they always have kool keith?: I don't understand why anybody likes kool keith. Really though his rapping is horrid and he ruins any song you put him on. If Dj spooky would have just cut the kool keith tracks this would have been much better. on the other hand the other tracks on this album almost always range from the stellar to great range

1, Katie B. loves Jensen: This is a good show. At first I thought it would be a blowout but my friend (who loves Jensen Ackles) recommended it to me or else I probably wouldn't have watched it.If you are into ghosts and supernatural experinces than you will love this show.Season 2 is on now if you like season 1 it is on the CW at 9pm on Thursdays. If you want a little more of an idea of what the show's about think of it as a tv show based on the Amityville Horror movie.
0, Wooden acting: Like so many modern TV shows
0, A lost opportunity: A great premise
1, It made for a great gift.: I know absolutely nothing about this series. However
1, Best since X-Files: I like the music
1, A very exciting show: I really like this series. It combines my two favorite things to watch on tv: really good looking guys and Supernatural things. It's funny enough to make you laugh out loud and interesting enough to make you anxious for the next show to come on. One of my favorites.
1, Supernatural:The first complete season: This DVD series of Supernatural was great!! Even though I haven't been able to watch it yet I've been waiting for the right time to be able to watch them all in one sitting or maybe two.Recommend other people to buy it if they like this show.I LOVE THIS SHOW!! :)
1, WOW!: I LOVE this show and am SUPER happy to have this season in my collection. I plan to get all seasons up to and includeing this years. This item arrived earlier than I had expected it and was VERY happy.

1, EAT YOUR VEGGIES LOLA!: This is my favorite from the Charlie and Lola collection and our Kindergartener loves it too. Charlie could teach a parenting class based on this book! It's written very well and the characters continue to entertain (and teach) or Son.
0, Great Story -- Poor Format: My daughter received this book (paperback; no pop-up) as a gift for her fifth birthday and we love it! I immediately ordered three in the pop-up version for gifts for friends. We received the books and the pop-ups did not work. Their placement in the book also made the story sound choppy. We sent them back! Great book. Just don't purchase the pop-up version.
1," Bone Represents on DVD: Its not the question of ""what can I say about this DVD?"". Its more or less ""what ISN'T there to say?"". This DVD totally met every single expectation I had for its long awaited release. A discography w/song samples"
1, Excellent: This is my most favoured book in Origami. I have done all the models from the zebra
1," New to the Craft?: Nicely done for beginners or ""dabblers"". Jot down your notes"
1," Grandson loves it: My almost 3 yr old grandson loves this book. We have read it many times. He knows most of it by heart. Often he will say ""Round and round"

1, Some great episodes here.: Aside from the new interview with production manager Bernie Williams who reveals lots of tidbits about the show and some neat video footage
1, knitted farm: I like this book
0, Most Overrated Film of 2005: Quite frankly this was not a good movie. Its starts off somewhat interstingly
0, Horrible: Where to start? Let's see...you live in a small town and in the process of saving your friends during a robbery
1," ""Violence"" really packs a punch!: Awesome! Don't miss this film directed by horror director David Cronenberg who gets top-notch performances from this perfect cast. This story has it all. I can only compare the complexity of these characters and the acting to those inCrashandOrdinary People.This film is a testimony to the secrets we all keep. Does anyone really know us? Do we really know our neighbor? Can we have equal portions of good and evil in us? This film offers no pat answers and may have you asking more questions with its open-ended ending. The story seems to ask just what part of our past can we leave in the past"
0, Don't waste your time: The acting in this movie was just plain bad. I am a big fan of Viggo Mortenson
0, Graphic Voyeurism: I happened across this film as a friend was watching it. If extremely brutal graphic violence and sex are your ticket
0, meh: In some ways an interesting plot
0, Hokey piece of garbage: One star only because I can't give it a zero. This movie is totally unrealistic and adolescent. I couldn't get much past the wife dressed as a cheerleader sex scene -- Wow
0, just ok: i wasn't feeling this film too tough. it jumped all over the place&never really fully explained itself. the violent nature of the film sells it more than a actual storyline to me. I watched this film the other night trying to put everything into perspective&this film just didn't fully click with me.this film couldn't make up it's min what time frame it was in as well. part of felt like Mayberry&the other part sorta felt like the matrix. it was trying alot of things&mising most of the time
1, good but a bit too short: i did like this film but i think if they could have made it a bit longer by showing his past alittle more it would have been a little better.. its still good tho.
0, Toal waste of talent!!!: I am a big fan of ed harris and viggo mortensen but was I shocked to see the needless sex and gore used in this movie. There was no story or plot that made sense or even justified the sex and gore used. Don't waste time on this loser movie. If this is one of the year's best I can see why my wife and I enjoy the old films of paul newman and others of his era. Also
0, laughable: Hey Cronenberg
1, chaos princess: Ok so it takes a lot for me to give a five star review here. I just thought that this was one of the most mind stimulating movies of the year. Maria Bello protrayal of the unknowing wife of a killer
0, HORRIBLE
0," One of a number of conversations........: This is one of a number of pre-production conversations that should have taken place (and obviously didn't)Cronenberg:""Uh...remember when on page 22 Tom has the run-in with the two guys at the diner?""Scripwriter:""Yeah..""Cronenberg:""And remember how it brings flocks of reporters to his Diner and local"

1, T-Mac 2s are the best basketball shoe out there: Let me start off by saying WOW. These shoes are sooo unbelivable its not funny. The bulit in sock gives you better ankel support and the laces never come un-tied. The style of this shoe is amazing. I give who ever made this shoe a 50 out of 10. I have played ball with a pair of T-Mac 2s and it feels as if you are wearing socs. The material it is made out of must be very light. The cusioning inside the shoe is has so much comfort it feels as if you are playing ball in a pair of fluffy socks. The non-marking sole is sweet too if you want to playing on or off the court. If you are playing off court

0, I wasted my money on this one :(: I hate to leave such a negative review
0, A Waste of Trees: The problem with so many how-to books (this one included) is that they spend page after page telling you what they are going to tell you
0, Does not fit MB 1984 300D: This item does not fit a 1984 MB 300D
1, Heartwarming tale of the human spirit: This is a wonderful story of one woman's journey toward true understanding of love
0, Easy Spanish: Easy Spanish is a great idea but the book is hopelessly outdated. Info about telegraphing et al is ridiculous. I wish there could be a more useful book.
0, Easy Spanish Phrase Book: This books is not very practical..It lacks every day phrases that are necessary in normal conversation
0, too little: I have a Tokyo Marui AK47S. They are built true to spec so most accessories fit. This universal cover does not.It is a couple cm too short and in no way would ever work with my gun. I need to return it because no amount ofmodification short of buying a welder and some sheet metal will allow this to fit.
0, Very unhappy: This was bought to add an aftermarket scope. The dust cover fits perfectly but now that I have a scope mounted
1, Great Murder Mystery with race overtones: If you haven't seen this Academy Award winning movie from 1967

1, The Best Murder Mystery Ever!: A black Philadelphia detective becomes involved in a murder case in a small
1, One Of The Greats: This is one of those movies I tune into anytime I see it on TV. Decided it was time to buy it. Sound and video is high quality. Super fast shipping
1, Based on a true story.: This movie will probably not resonate with very young girls. You must take into consideration the historical period in which this drama takes place in order to empathize with Adele H. This is definitely a chick flick. I enjoyed it for its genre.
0, Huge Disappointment.: As a big time
1," PAUL RIFFIN: ""A masterful collection of poetic strength and clairty of vision; poems dealing with a broad range of subjects from a fighter learning of hands"

0, John is a Brat as we know him: I always adored McEnroe since my childhood. I am a tennis player and dreamed of being to the top someday. But since I chose to put studies first before my tennis
1, An appropriate title: As I read this book I found it hard to believe that what I was reading was actually written by one of the adventurers. I was sure that I must be reading an account of their expidition based on one of their diaries that was recoverd next to their bodies. That Fiennes and Strand found it withing themselves to keep going is hard to believe
0, Horrible BOOK! Do Not buy: Do not buy this book
1, Almost perfect - typical Warner Bros. shortcomings.: Great picture and DTS sound
0, Don't buy this HD DVD Version: I bought this HD Dvd version simply because I had spent heavily into HD dvd players;Toshiba(4 of them;no lectures please).I need as many HD dvd movies as possible just to make my purchases relevant(more the reason
1, Kushiel's Dart Is Excellent: Jacqueline Carey is an excellent writer that captures yourattention in the first few pages. Phedre no Delaunay

1, Not to be Rivaled...: This is an amazing book. The sheer imagination required to come up with the world in which the main character

0, Angelique revisted.: I haven't read anything like this since the Angilique novels of the early 70's. Our heroine is both slave and independent female. She likes both roles.This was not a fantasy

1, Food was never better in a movie: This movie is a glorious affirmation of life and food.The dinner prepared by Babette changes the lives of allthe characters there. The sheer pleasure of food is rightthere on the screen. As is the pleasure of companionshipand love that the dinner also provides.This is a wonderful movie and I always like to be ableto say this - no one gets shot.

1, Best. Hardware Kit. Ever.: We use these to hold hardware for different installation applications. We have 16 in use currently. They get sat on
0, Nice Product BUT......: First of all
1, Perfect for storing your gaming minis: I do not fish. I actually purchased two of these tackle boxes for storing my Star Wars gaming minis. There is lots of storage and plenty of space. The removable draws help me organize my minis and bring them with me when I game at my friends homes.My only complaint is that the picture looks like there should be a storage container in the lower right hand space and when I opened mine up
1, Replaced our Plano 777 with this one!: We needed a replacement for our Plano 777 and they no longer sell that model this is the closest one we could find to match it. We use this to hold our tools and supplies for an onsite business and it works perfectly. The only difference in the two different tackle boxes were the slide in drawers and they had a box in the larger compartment however that wasnt a problem for us we still had the other ones from the 777 and they all fit in perfectly. We use this daily for work and they last for years really nice product.
1, I listened to the audio version and loved it.....: It started slow but chapter after chapter I was hooked. I couldn't stop listening. The narrator was wonderful but the story was mesmerizing. I fell in love with these down to earth flawed characters. One of the best romance audio books.
1, The Handbook of Psionics is the definitive source.: The Complete Psionics Handbook is
1, Congratulations Michelle: What a beautiful
0, Masterubg tge kabgyage of Web Design: The book is basically a cookbook on converting an existing table based web-site to a combo table/CSS format. After going through the first few chapter I realized a person would not learn much from this book. There is much better books on CSS on the market. Avoid this one.

0, I LOVE PAM
1, The best book ever!: I love this book and my daughter does too! The spanish translates beautifully. The text and story is quite entertaining. I highly recommed this book for babies over 12months.
0, Sometimes engaging
0, The Penwyth Curse: It didn't seem like Catherine wrote this. I was very disappointed in it. It was disjointed and so many things were not explained satisfactorily at the end. There where too many things left hanging. I am one of her biggest fans
0, Not Coulter's Best - Pass on this one!: I was very disappointed in the much anticipated book. I had hoped for an exciting story about a curse and people in love. What I got was a time travel story with Witches
0, A Glaze of Color: Creating Color and Design on Ceramicsed: This was a really disappointing purchase. There may have been some good techniques embedded somewhere
1, wonderful wonderful wonderful: The Master and Margarita has wonderfully complex characters and an enthralling storyline that kept me riveted. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
1, real genius: This is not a novel. This is a special product offering a view over a style of life and political events which distroyed and affected millions of people. To have the power
0, SKIP IT: If you have a friend who doesn't know Gamma Ray and you lend this album to him
0, a big let down: I was exteremely disappointed with Trauffaut. The movie lacked any simple sensibility there should be in a movie. What is being called suspenseful by most reviewers is strange as there is nothing suspenseful about the kind of killings she was doing etc. The director rarely shows the trauma of what led her to be so keen on revenge etc. I think the movie was quite silly and very hard to believe.
0, I'm still not sure who did what and why.: I had a hard time maintaining interest in this book. I've read all of Ms. Perry's books and have never had this problem. It was difficult to keep the characters and their beliefs straight. However this book has sparked an interest for me in the Irish Problem.
0, Extremely boring account of boring people: I have read many of Anne Perry's books and enjoyed all of them until I read this mess. The characters are boring and the story is also. I got half way through it and decided it wasn't going to improve. I am sorry for readers who bought it and couldn't return it to the library! In a word I would describe it BOOOOORRRRRRIIINNNG!
0, definitely not what I expected....: I was less than impressed with this book. The quality of the type is practically impossible to read. It looks like it was poorly copied from the original text. Get a different version. I am looking to return it...
1, The Real deal: Bruce Marchiano is an excellent Godly actor who is careful to present Jesus according to scripture. Also
0, very basic: It is understandable why this book is free. It indeed is a short history of France from medieval times to late 1800's. Because it is short many finer details are left out and references to people and places leave one slightly confused
1, Chuckanucka is swell: We have Chuckanucka
1, Excellent and inspiring!: The book was very well written and had many informative and inspirational points to it. A 93 year old woman and I get together and reading Christian books and read the Bible. This book enhanced our time together and blessed our spirits.
1, PAM GRIER IS FABULOUS!!!! A GODDESS!!!!: This
1, nice scent: My husband sits by the pellet stove to relax. It's in the basement which gets musty
1, Fate Sucks: Thomas Hardy has written a beautiful and tragic novel in RETURN. Fantastic story and ending once you get past the lengthy description of Egdon Heath. Breathtakingly powerful novel. A must read.
1, BT is quite prolific.: I believe all of BT's work is quite good
0, Great beats
1, Grandson's cookbook.: I bought this for my 17 yr. old grandson who is interested in cooking extra food for himself. He loves this book.
1, Ordered for gift: I don't yet know what my daughters will say about these books. I ordered one for each for Christmas gifts
0, The Not So Well-Filled Tortilla: This is definitely a book that should be seen before bought. It required ingredients not always found in the typical home pantry. Additionally
0, another one-shot plastic throw away: Nice light until you need to replace the battery - just try to put it back together so that it works.
1, great escapist fare: Black Scorpion always makes me smile. It's a fun movie with a great leading lady and a good sense of fun. I've watched this on more than one rainy Sunday afternoon. A black leather clad superheroine battles the Darth Vader like Breathetaker who wants to make the entire city asthmatic. Silly and sexy cult entertainment.
0, False Advertising: This book is very decieving. It tricks you into thinking that there are Irish wedding traditions
0, more like a 3 year battery: Like others
0, 10 year battery? I've had two die in less than 2 years: Like the subject line says:1) 10 year battery #1 was manufactured in 2007 and died in June 20092) 10 year battery #2 was manufactured in Feb 2009 and died in Jan 2010The first time I'd take as an exception. The second time means I'll never buy this again.
1, All around great book for children: I remember this ryming story of the cute little ant trying to help the poor broken tea kettle. This story is great for children. The pictures of the other kitchen dwellers helping the poor broken tea kettle are highly enjoyable. It is still a wonderful childhood memory even though I'm all grown up.
1, Wonderful Memories! Special Times with Special Rhymes!: When my son was about five years old (he is now 21)
0, Not Very Helpful: This book is very limited. You have to look at each page to ID the flower. Some pictures are not very clear
0, Unhappy: I live on the Treasure Coast of Florida (between Sebastian and Hobe Sound) and up till now I relied on various websites to help me ID plants. Because this method of searching is very time consuming I thought it was time to invest in a field guide.Armed with 20+ plants already identified I used these as my starting point. My search through the index of this book concluded with 3 listings out of 20+ plants. Such low results are a tremendous disappointment!While time consuming
0, pieces don't match: I purchansed several sets of this flatware. I have found some large spoons weigh 55 grams and some weight 48 grams and have a very differnent shape and feel. I have also found some small forks and small spoons also have a different shape and feel. Many of the pieces had very visible grinding marks. The difference seems to be country of origin. The pieces made in USA all match and the pieces made in China all match. In some cases the USA made were better finish and shape and in one case the China made were heavier and had a smoother finish. It is a real dissappointment that my set doesn't match.

1, One of Oprah's best picks yet: I have not read a book that completely had me hooked by the 2nd page. It was incredible. I looked forward to returning to Gap Creek nightly.I wanted to reach out to Julie and hug her. She's one of the strongest characters I've ever read about. To endure such heartache and at such a young age and to keep overcoming it. She was extraordinary. What a strong woman she was.I thought Hank finally pitched in when taking care of Delia. I was surprised at his care and concern since he had very little concern throughout the book for his wife.Robert Morgan describes child birth in such vivid detail
0, I want my money back.: I'm not a professional book reviewer
1, A delicate novel
1, Gap creek: This was a moving story
0, depressing: I read books to learn about places and people and history--I already knew enough of what these people experienced and went through--I had a hard time finishing the book (I read at least one book a day)--but finished it because I never do not complete a book--I kept thinking maybe something would happen wonderful in the end--anyway

It came with a broken leg and the rack was in several pieces and a piece was missing. Should have returned it. Not recommended to anyone. EVER
1, Beautiful and diverse early Portuguese music: Gerard Lesne is at his best here with a disc giving a rare slice of Portuguese music from 1500. I have listened to this disc countless times and the nuances and joy of Lesne and the artists he works with only manifest more. An album of delight and discovery.

1, Great Eastern Sun: This book is a tough read
1, Simply Amazing!: This movie is absolutely amazing. It is filled with suspense
1, how strong is love?: I have to admit that I decided to read this book on account of the very angry review by Mr. Huebner. I'm glad I did. It's a good book. Really made me think. I could understand why Mr. Heubner was upset upon receiving a poor printing of a book that he thought was about a totally different subject; but was the book moronic? In my opinion

0, Sucked: If Austin woulden't have wrestled this video would only get one star. Don't waste your time and money with this video. The matchs are edited. And worst yet instead of JR Kevin Kelly is an anouncer. If JR coulden't be an anouncer at least let the King Be #2.

0, Terrible CD: This is one of the worst preparation material I have ever come across... full of mistakes
1, Music For Any Mood: Positive and Uplifting!: Another great work from this gifted Composer/Performer. Don Robertson's music is soothing to the mind and spirit while it tells a story. In KEYS
1, Wertmuller is amazing: Director Lina Wertmuller's provocative film takes the class struggle to a desert island where only the man and the woman exist. Wertmuller's scenario is that of the man assuming the role of ruler and the woman one of worker-slave
1, My favorite of Kingsolver's many good books: Codi's sister is in Nicaragua fighting for justice. Codi returns to the mining town in Arizona where she grew up and find herself fighting demons from her past and present. A beautiful book that probes the psyche of a complex woman. A story of love
0, Pretentious

0, Mostly Later Recordings By A Partying Jerry Lee Lewis: The recordings are from the middle-age Jerry Lee Lewis when partied so much that his voice and caring and memory just did not go into music any more. I listened to many of his orginal recording sessions when we ran around LA together-none of those great quality sessions are on this cd.
1, Rock & Roll The Legendary Years 1957-1959: Great complitiation of songs. If you are looking for some oldies this is the album for you. I just love it.
0, Not Enough 'Love OR Sex'!: Poor Famke Janssen just can't find Mr. Right! This film
1, Definitely not your typical romantic comedy!: Love & Sex is a movie that follows a late twenties to early thirties woman through the perils and hazards of sex
1, Good Movie: What an amusing
0," When Prick Met Loser: Absolutely beyond belief that this theatrical travesty is so highly regarded. The ""heroine"" is utterly clueless about how and when she is being treated badly and her boyfriend (for most of the movie) is a smug"
0, heard it before: Demetre rehashes many things we've already heard before about how to win the weight wars. She spiritualizes everything
1, My daughter's absolute favorite: We bought this for my daughter at 11 months old. It is by far her favorite toy. She would ride in this all day long if she could. We have pushed her in it for a mile at a time with no discomfort to either one of us. The parent handle is a nice height. I'm 5'8 and pleased not to have to stoop to push her. My daughter loves this car so much that she actually threw her first temper tantrum when we took her out after a long ride. She did not want to stop riding :) I am very pleased with how durable it is

0, blankets: where are the blankets?? never got them in the mail or it was stolen ;-( I have emailed the seller 3 times--nothing from them at all!!! Im not happy with the seller at all because they never responded...
1, What's expected: These thrermal blankets perform exactly as advertised. They are very thin mylar or something
1, Used for Tent Footprint: I purchased these to use as a tent footprint for a hiking and camping trip to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. This product is just as described and much cheaper than an official tent footprint.
1, Bought for Emergency Kit: Bought for emergency kit. item is as expected. didn't open one. like that it was a 4 pack. 2 for Emer. Kit & 2 for car. Good Price.
1, Looks good.: It is hard to review this item due to its nature (I will not use it until if there is ever an emergency that would cause me to use/experience it)However
1, Nintendo DS Uno game: Really nice game. Very easy to play. I like the game on cards and now like it also on the DS.
1, Fantastic release from a criminally underrated band!: Exciter are one of the most amazing yet underrated bands in all of speed/thrash metal. Heavy Metal Maniac is a classic and Violence and Force and Long Live the Loud are great as well. However it seems that after Ricci left (and eventually came back)

0, Bodum Glass Beaker 3 cup: I was mislead by the 3 cup description. This 3 cup means three four ounce meansurements which came to a 12 ounce capacity. There was no way to know by the description that this was what I was ordering. I also found that some of the Peets Coffee stores carry them in stock.
0, It's a thicker glass
0," definitely a swindle: An incompetent attempt to compose a makeshift compillation without knowing anything abouth the epoch. 9/10 of the stuff represents commercial pop or more or less decent music but with no relation to the hippy culture. Small Faces are a mod group and Temptations - afro-american soul. Why The Marmelade and Ike&Tina; Turner? Why not It's a Beautiful Day or Greateful Dead? Not Bob Dylan? A greate disappointment.They compillators should call it ""Square bourgeois commercial pop cover versions"""
1, Great value if purchased at Sam's Club: This set is at Sam's club for 15 something a whole 11 dollars less then Best Buy and other outlets. Then each movie comes out to be about 3 dollars
0, Efashions Solutions: This dress is cheap and gaudy looking....nothing like it looks in the photo online. Also the expedited shipping is a rip off...they charged $18.00 for what was Priority Mail...I sent it back the same way and the cost was only $6.20.
1, They're coming down for you: Official Version
1, Muy buen reloj: Por el precio de venta
1, Good multifunction watch: The watch is great. Keeps acurate time along with its multiple functions. The only function lacking is the movable bezel. It moves too freely with no ratcheting mechanism. The bezel is very smooth making realignment of the bezel somewhat difficult.
1, Good price 
1, Great performance for cheap!: OK
0, Horrible: Doesnt work. I threw it in the Garbage after a week. It varies day by day and never consistent. Dont waste your time.
1, good watch for hiking: I would give this a 5 star if not for the fact that there is no easy way to change the battery and the manufactorer wants you to pay $10 to ship it back to them!That isn't right and I took it upon myself to change it myself as 2 of those batterys cost half of that.I quickly realized that there is a special battery plastic surround that will surely break unless you take great care.I had to put a piece of cardboard between the back cover and the battery to get it to work.No problems in over a yr since I did it.I have been out in the mountains hunting and climbing in all kinds of weather
1, A Masterpiece!: Like another reviewer on this page
0, A Walk in the Clouds DVD: I am very disappointed in this DVD. It came new and was given as a Christmas gift. When this item was opened and placed in the DVD player
1, One of least publicized Keanu Reeves movies that deserves a lot of praise: I hadn't heard of this movie until it came on cable tv. I'm so glad that I took the time to watch it. This is a very romantic movie where the chemistry between Keanu
0, are you kidding?: ...this movie was truly lousy. I actually like Keanu Reeves
1, Si me llamas amor: This is one of my favorite movies

1, The Big Brawl (Battle Creek Brawl): This movie was my first Jackie Chan. I had anticipated a serious KUNG-FU type movie and was pleasantly surprised by the humor is this spoof of the genre. From the breath-taking physical challenge at the bridge to the skating to the actual hand/foot to hand/foot
0, no good fight scenes
0, Boring
1," Buy this book - NOW! Before you tell your wife you want a divorce!: This is the best book you can buy if you ever even think you might want to dump your wife. Read it and take the time to ""think before you act""! Protect yourself in the long run. This book has a lot of funny stuff in it"
0, bad mojo jojo: This product made my hair more dry and wispy than before. I would not recommend for my hair type. I have straight /semi-wavy hair
0," Barrier-Breaking Resumes And Interviews: Here is the first paragraph of the Introduction verbatim: ""Barrier-Breaking Resumes And Interviews is not an ordinary how-to-find-a-job book. This book is for those who have little or no work experience"
1, Nice Rotor: Installed very easily and really like the coating to protect them from rusting out. Only thing
0," only half book: its look like its only half of the book ""with fire and sword"""
0, Very slow read: I didnt like it. I couldnt get past the first chapter. Should get a refund. It moves way too slow and does not really continue from book 2
1, Second Best Novel I've Ever Read: This is the second best novel I've ever read. It was a little difficult to read the first time
1, Lewis at his best and most entertaining: This book is fun to read
0, Reverts to the bad ones: The Office pattern has become stereotyped lately. Every once in a while there's a good episode: where the characters are believable
1, Brilliant series!!: The best series since series 2! Just loved it. Really funny
0, Boring
0," Blu Ray Version doesn't work: The one star is specifically for the Blu Ray version of the Office Season 6 because the set was released with a serious flaw. The first disc freezes up on the ""Niagra"" episode"
1, Of Great Value: I ordered this product from Amazon knowing I would get good quality items at a good price. I had ordered other things in the past and I have always been pleased with them . It was a gift for my daughter's birthday and she is thoroughly enjoying it. She does her shopping here as well.
0, Too bad Universal won't bother to fix defective discs.: Well
1, Great toy for 2 year old: I got this for my 2 year old daughter and she has loved it from day one. It's of good quality construction and very light so it can be moved easily. She goes up the steps and down the slide or up the slide and down the steps !!
1, 60 Feet of Pure Terror: Come on now
1, Belle: Beautiful book. Love the sketches coupled with the selected quotes and excerpts. Makes you feel like you're there

0, Color
1, Charlotte Church in the Holy Land - Review - Jim Davis: This is one of the best Christmas performances I have ever seen. Dormition Abbey in Jersualem provides the perfect location for the traditional songs Charlotte performs on this DVD. The location and her performance are extraordinary in both sound and visual effect.
0, Horrible Mats - That Look Cool: I got these for the back two seats of my 2012 Chevy Equinox. They didn't protect nearly enough of the floor
0, Not Worth the Money: First the good news. The sound quality is very good. Fit is poor and the stiff cord is in the way and annoying. Was disappointed in general. Definately NOT Studio Quality.
0, Good sound
0, Don't buy: The LCD screen on this device is much too difficult to view. I would not recommend a purchase.
1, Very good: Very good read. I knew of Peretti and wanted to get a good fiction to read so I purchased this. It's an older book (no cell phone and typewriters vs computers if you could imagine ;) but a good book is a good book and it was as many reviewers have referred to a page turner. As other s have commented it's not a theology book
1, Awesome book: Awesome book and story telling. Worth the read and time spent on it. The message is quite clear and inspiring. Lets live to out next level of motivation.
1, I rarely find a great book...and I most certainly did this time: I'm very picky when it comes to what I like to read. I love spiritual warfare. Angels and humans vs. demons. This definitely fit the bill.
1, You can't put it down
1, Good entertainment
1, Awesome!: I loved it! I thought it was great
1, The first is the best!: Frank Peretti makes one believe in angels and demons. As you go through the book
1, More collected essays: This book is simliar to ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN in consisting of several dozen short
1, Funny and thought provoking.: Fulghum has had an interesting life. He's been a minister
0, A very hard book to read for an animal lover: Those who love this book are obviously not dog lovers. Fulghum recommends doing like the Thais and eating dogs. He bemoans the amount spent on companion dogs--instead of criticizing the millions spent on pursuits that have nothing to do with loving another creature. Instead of reviling love in the form it takes when we love our dogs
0, Plodding story: I kept reading this story hoping that it was just a slow starter
0, I like a story to have an ending.: Don't get me wrong
1, colorado kid: Love this. Since one of my favorite shows is Haven
0, Why did I bother?: So
0, so boring: I enjoy Stephen King
0, A Story about Not Solving Mysteries: Picking this up
0, dissappointed: Keep your money for something else. I persevered till about half way through the book
0," Misdirection doesn't work in storytelling: This book suffers from the same symptom that M. Night Shaymaylan's The Village movie suffers from. You can't advertise and sell a book as being in a certain genre and have the ""twist"" be that the story is actually in another genre.If not labeled a Hard Case Crime story"
0, The Anti-Mystery Story: This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried. It won't be the last
0, not worth the read: I bought this book based on the fact that the Haven TV show is loosely based on it. Boy was I disappointed. Only thing I can see it copies is the two old newspaper men. Besides that let down
0, Self-Indulgent Tripe: I know Stephen King loves the pulp genre; so do I. The difference is that I didn't slap together half a novella and try to cash in on pulp's recent resurgence. King did.When King is good he's very good
1, Poignant Mastery: The voices are verily realistic. Their slang is captured with the author's skilful ear and concise writing. They are two gentlemen being attentive to their younger counterpart at a tiny news agency on a small island. The schooling is unique and the girl has to use all her senses to determine the flow and outcome of the mystery being told. Taking place on an island the rule differs from the mainland
0, Roman-a-clef-sans-clef: I'll admit
1, Intriguing light reading.: Haven is only very loosely based on The Colorado Kid. That being said
1, great short story: Can't get enough of S. King. This is a great story and leaves you just the way a King story should to your imagination just like a great oil painting
1, Bring back pulp/weird fiction !!!: Even though i'm in my 30's
1, Gift Order: Meets exectations of recipient and looking forward to receiving more products in the future from gift giver through Amazon. Thanks.
1, Gets you thinking: I got this book hoping it would give me some more the back-story to Haven (SyFy show based on book). Well it really didn't help me much there and it wasn't the best story. But I still did enjoy reading it. The only thing I wish was that there might have been a bit more of hints to why the Colorado Kid was in Maine
0, Boring: This is a tedious novel. It's only 180 pages long and I still had to push myself to bother finishing it. This is really nothing more than a short story padded out to short novel length and that's one of its many problems: The central mystery is uninteresting. The way it is written
0, eeeeeh....: I was at the airport
1, Long and durable: (I am using my moms laptop so ignor the craft queen thing...)Know
1, Good period piece.: I enjoyed the book
0, NOT what I expected!: Wish I'd known that these tracks were all live recordings
0, Ashamed of the Quality: I am amazed that the red rocker would stoop to such a low level in fact I am ashamed. Sammy you are much more of a blessed and capable artist than this. God (the one and only true God that is above all other man made god's ie. buddh
1," MAS TEQUILA!: Sammy has once again shown that he still deserves the title of ""red rocker""! This cd shows all of his finest qualities"
0, Didn't fit frame: I made sure to order the right volume replacement beaker for the frame of my Bodum press
1, replacement beaker: it was a little tricky figuring out which size replacement beaker i needed for my french press. i used the Bodum website and information from the Amazon reviews to pick this size and it fits perfectly. now i'm caffeinated again and life is good.
1, better than the original: I bought my original french press at a thrift store for $1.25. Sure
1, replacement glass beaker: I have been very happy with this replacement beaker. It seems to be good quality. The original was not Bodum
1, Better than the old one
1, Got What I Expected in a Jiffy: I got what I expected - a genuine Bodum 34-Ounce coffee press replacement glass beaker. What I am most impressed by was the speed I had received my order. I placed my order on Dec. 27th and expected it to arrive on Jan. 2nd as indicated. Instead
1, Kurt Vonnegut Cat's Cradle: I enjoyed reading Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle
1, Fast shipper: I was impressed how quickly it arrived and in great condition. I hope we can work again. it is really helping my daughter for her classes
1, An insightful look into the insanity of religion.: This book takes an interesting look at religion
0, Builds fascinating layers and then collapses: I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this book. But then it was if if Vonnegut said
0, Not what I had hoped: Maybe I did not read the fine print
1, Perhaps not so fantastic in retrospect: I've read many of Kurt Vonneguts books. I consider him to be my favorite writer and it is through this work that I was first introduced to American Pop writing. To me
1, Best book in the world: Kurt Vonnegut was the most brilliant mind alive at the turn of the century. It is an utter shame that he died recently
0, Not As Good as Star Wars: This is a decent sci-fi escape
1, See the cat? See the cradle?: Vonegut's most excellently crafted novel. So light and easy to read - so heavy in imagery and message! It's fun and funny but dwells on the pointlessness of material wealth
1, Holds Canon PowerShot D10 size camera: From the description
0, It broke!: I purchased this for my 3 y/o. She's not hard on her toys at all... and this broke the first day. The pieces falling off made it a danger to her and it had to be tossed.
1, Fresh
1," Collier's Junior Classics Set: These books are excellent reading for your exceptional or advanced child. I am an elementary teacher and read these stories to students grades 3-5 to get them to ""settle down."" They are excellent bedtime stories except your children will not want to go to sleep because of the well-written material. They tend to be"
1, INTENSE: Grabs you from cover to cover
0, High School Band Recital: I purchased this CD based on (1) It's price (2) the other review Iread. With all due respect for the other reviewer
1, Visually great! But it misses something...: I have to say that this is a work of art for movies. The production values are definitely some of the best I have seen recently
0, Lousy portrail of Howard Hughes: To portray Howard Hughes as an crazy idiotmakes no sense. He was a pioneer in aircraftand aerospace and didn't get there my osmosis.In real life he became a strange recluse afterhe was disfigured in a airplane accident were hewas the test pilot of a new plane for the military.He bacame addicted to pain drugs after the accidentand died a recluse. The movie in typical holywood fashionmakes him out to be an idiot from birth and ignoresthe contributions for technology and medicine thathe and his companies were responsible for. They donot even show the Humana Hospitals that he was responsiblefor or anything on the Glomar Explorer.. There are about30 minutes of strange behavior which dragged on and couldhave been covered in 2 or less. Save your money ...the aremuch better movies out..Bob
1, Very graphic: My husband and I liked this movie - except for the horrible plane crash that Hughes experienced. It was so graphic and painful that my husband was still talking about it the next day. The portrayal of OCD in Hughes life was very brilliantly played by DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett made a surprisingly accurate Katherine Hepburn.The Aviator is a movie that we have to plan to watch because it is so long and time-consuming. Usually it's a rainy day film
1, Excellent movie
1, Not that bad: Saw this while Puppy sitting.DiCaprio isn't one of my favorite actors but he did a superb job portraying Howard Hughs. One of aviation's unsung heroes
1, You don't know anything about documentaries?: If you want to know it all about how to start working in your own documentary
1," I know the song you are looking for!!!!: The song when they are dancing is called "" Set Adrift On Memory Bliss"" By PM DawnI hope you appreciate this it took a long time to find this out."
0, Ludicrous: CD/abridged/Thriller: This was book 18 of the Dr. Alan Gregory series
0, Ho-Hum: Tried to get interested but I find the character of Alan Gregory just a bore. There are some fine sequences in this book but I felt like I was reading one of those parlor mysteries where the ramblings of the main characters were more important than the mystery itself. When the villian is revealed at the end I found myself not buying it. Maybe because of the lack of real character development or the lack of empathy for Alan Gregory. This is the third Alan Gregory novel by Stephen White that I have read and this time I have asked myself 'is that all there is? I think that this series is worth the effort to read but I warn you not to start with this entry. You may be put off and ignore others from this author which are very good reads. Also be aware that some books of the series shift the main character emphasis from Alan Gregory to Lauren Crowder
1, thisisamustread.com: I purchased onyourown.com on a whim
1, Just what we wanted: We used to have a comforter draped over our couch but one of our dogs kept pulling the stuffing out. Now we have one of these. The dogs leave it alone
0, Moving blanket pretty ugly: By the image you would imagine the possibility of getting a somewhat attractive blanket. Don't count on it. I'm glad I only ordered one because it is pretty ugly. Probably will last a long time for a pet blanket
1, Will come back to buy this again: This is a great product that feels clean the minute you put it on....MSM is known for its natural sulfur compound that is good for repairing and healing. I have already seen a difference in my skin by use only once daily. A good price for a good product....
1, The Best: Hey
1, Awesome: The shipment of this product came at a fair length of time. The condition of the book was great. This company provided Excellent Service. I would recommend this to anyone.
0, This book sucks: This book just states the same stuff over and over about the fear of failure and doesnt help you one bit if you are suffering from this. I beg you not to read this book unless you have time to waste because its not worth your time at all.
1," Tobor the Great - DVD review: Purchased through Amazon.com. This was a favorite robot movie from the early 1950s. I remember watching this movie on WGN's ""Family Classics"" with Frazier Thomas back in the 1960s. A little corn"
0, Product is not functional: I saw mixed reviews and thought for the price I would take a chance.That was a mistake. I received the item quickly (2 days) however once I opened the product Both Holsters were all but sewn shut. There is no way to place a weapon in either side. Both the top and the bottom of each holster has an opening about 1 inch only. It would appear this manufacture has no quality control at all. The item is now being returned for a refund as a replacement was not an option for this particular item.Please do not waste your time even at this price the product is not worth it as it just does not serve the intended purpose.
1, I'm in double love with this rig!: I bought this with a couple other shoulder holster rigs from Amazon. I already have tactical vests with cross draw rigs on them and two drop holsters by UTG also from Amazon. I love this rig the best. I'm going to modify it with a couple extra magazine holders. It fits my Heckler and Koch USP .40 S&W I just bought last week extremely well. I plan on buying a second gun for the off-side. I can shoot left handed but rarely practice it. I'll have to work on the double cross-draw though. I will say none of the rigs I bought at Amazon were cheap quality. I liked each one of them
0, BEWARE!!! NOT AN E.L.O. ALBUM!!!: For some reason
0, Do you like SCOOBY DOO?: These cartoons are typical of late-1970s Hanna-Barbera TV output: cheap
0, Not a happy shopper.: The CDs was /is cracked to the point that it do not play . The disc were all very dirty and really didnt play at first.I am very disappointed and kinda feel that I wasted my money. I would let to exchange it or get replaced.
0, No way to handle venomous snakes.: Teachers and parents should be advised that Steve Irwin is far more interested in Steve Irwin looking daring than in young peoples' welfare. If North American kids try handling any of our resident deadly snakes the way Irwin does
0, Error in description: This item's dimentions are incorrect in the description it is only 2 inches deep not 3 inches. Other than that it is a quality plano product.
1, Very useful: This item came quickly and was in good condition. It was easy to but together and it's very useful. I use it to separate craft stuff.
1, Keep your readers turning pages: Whow
1, euphoria inducing: I can't remember the last time I have been so enchanted. In concert with her three back-up musicians
0, Diana Krall is a Boring Singer!!!!: This CD will put you to sleep. Even her REMIXES are boring. I hate this CD!!!! She is not a DIVA. To be a DIVA you must have style
0, a good overview of early hawkwind: the sound quality ranges from good to very good but the tunes say it all . kind of like boc meets the floyd but totally original and brain numbing ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK YOULL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN !!!
0, Don't bother: This book is poorly written
1, Ecellent reading
1, A very good book: The story of Squirrel Nutkin who is a very disrespectful and rude and provocative squirrel who gets taught a very tough lesson. Learning is not alway painless. Learning is not always pleasurable or fun. This is a fact of life.
0, somewhat disappointing: I thought this book would have more of a spiritual focus and it was more nutritionally based. I was looking for a more clear tie between nutrition and God's Word.

1, Worthy wine-related adventures: What could be more fun than finding and tasting unlikely wines in unlikely places? Not much
0, his third worst: Dissapointing. Young can play just about any genre well and country is no exception. The reason is: you believe him. He's not faking it. On Old Ways

0, A disappointed Christie fan: I thought I would love this
1, Great Quality
1, Happy with the style but the fit could be better: I looked at a lot of slippers before picking this one. None fulfilled all of what I was looking for. In the end I'm happy but I wish the sole extended fully to the outer edge of the foot to be more stable. Also if the back of the slipper extended higher up toward the ankle
0, These run very small!: I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small. I ordered him an 11
0, UGG Australia (china) Men's Ascot Slippers: You can't even get sheepskin from Australia
0, Painfully SLOW: I was expecting a very interesting read from this book
0, The Lady's Maid: This book was our book club pick last month. I would say only half of us read it . It was so slow in starting 
1, Contended with this Book!: I read this Puritan classic as a devotional in the morning. A needed reminder for me to be content in all things.
1, strong cargo rack: This rack is strong and can carry a lot of weight. I use it all the time for work and play. The only complaint I have is that once put together it looks like it dips down on one side.
0, Works but mine broke after a few months of occasional use.: Mostly plastic. Can be very hard to zero. Lettering too small to read unless you lift it up near your face. Mine broke after a few months of occasional use. If you plan to use more than 10-15 times then you should get something better.
1, Awaken to Superconsciousness: This book gives that unusual balance of deep inspiration andsupportive application. There's a clear orientation here towardsgiving the deepest understanding of what meditation andsuperconsciousness are really all about

1, great case: I bought this case for my relatively small digital camera. Works great...lightweight
0," Right up there with ""The Best of Uriah Heep"": Boy this is a bad album. It's really not even worth listening to after you've heard it once. There are a couple of good melodies in a couple of the songs"
0," Neil Young's worst album of all time!!!!!!!!!: I had the unfortunate experience of hearing this album again last week which reminded me why I traded in this piece of garbage years ago in college. This is hands down ""THE WORST NEIL ALBUM EVER""!Electric drum kit? Please. At least it fits the trend of the '80s....his worst album would be released during the worst music decade. Do yourself a favor and save your ears...don't buy or even listen to this album unless you need a laxative."
0, Doesn't live up to the hype: This is not a bad series
1, Perfect for readers of LEFT BEHIND!!!: THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is the perfect addition for readers of the LEFT BEHIND series. See the Tribulation from the other side with an Antichrist you'd be proud to take home to meet mom and dad. He's just sooooo good at being bad! But hang in there

0, Product is not as described: My poor rating is based not on the actual product
0, Dissapointed: I saw some reviews about it
0, Great Flashlight (at first): Although this flashlight is compact it is rugged
0, Save Your Money For Something Worth it: I have been using it for over a month now ... just to make this simple :at first the material felt good enough and the light was good for a small closed areaBut now it doesn't light any more .. it's more like a flashing thingyi Thing the warranty would have been useful for me except that i don't live in the US Right nowbut to be fair it's real small and effective in some situations.

1, Guillermo Herrera Arreola: Chayito. Felicidades por este maravilloso CD. que es una selección de las canciones que más se escuchan en México
0, what a helpless and hopeless movie: VERY artificial emotions. you see poor Sandra crying and pretending to be sad
1, Cry every time: As a child of divorce I know how it feel to hate the one person that you should love the most! Thinking to one that broke the marriage is the hero while the one that is in pain is the villian. This movie brings me back every time. I wish so much that my mother has a much strength as Berdie did in this film. I can watch this movie over and over just to listen to the music it contains. The soundtrack is one in a million. You can play it through and through and enjoy every song on it! I would recommend this movie for any woman that has every had her heart broken
1, Touching Movie: HOPE FLOATS is an excellent movie about finding yourself and learning to move on and have hope to live again. Sandra Bullock plays Birdie
1, Great Movie..and soundtrack!: I was impressed! I had avoided seeing this movie for years because I thought it looked like it was going to be a really bad
1, A good movie: I rented this disc last night and it was a pretty good movie. The performances are the best part of the film
0, Could have been better story.: A thin plot that dragged on without any redemption in the end. Bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer on christmas. Would have been easy to find a much better movie. If you were entertained by this then you obviously are easily entertained. Not one of Sandra Bullocks better movies. The effort was a waste of her talents.

0," Dead after 4 months!: So I actually upgraded to the Bytecc 350 after another enclosure failed. This one worked great for a good 4 months or so (although I must say the ""fashion led"" light is extremely annoying). Then all of a sudden the enclosure started beeping at me and my PC no longer recognized the drive. I tested the HD (Seagate 80 GB) in a different PC and it's working fine. Still no response from Bytecc customer service. I am done with external enclosures. I am going to go with a full external hard drive from Maxtor"

1, Great movie!: We watched this on Monday for family night. We should have got our box of tissues out before the movie started. This is my worst nightmare: that one of my children will become missing. I watched the movie in suspense realizing in my heart that this was a true story
1, Story of faith and a lesson to learn: The story id nice
0, The Way Home movie review: This movie is not my kind of movie at all and I thought it was very boring . I didn't like the story and I thought the acting wasn't all that great either. It did have the look and feel of a tv movie. Maybe if you are into this spiritual types of movie you might like it but personally it just wasn't all that good.
0, BUYER BEWARE: it's the old story of when you assume .....! I looked at the pictured items and assumed there would be at least one large suction cup. WRONG More than half way down the page
1, Highly Recommended: This is a great all around CD for listening and for bellydancing. I have performed to several songs on this CD and it's always a crowd pleaser. They are all very catchy and easy to move to. Also there are various tempos and styles to choose from. One of my favorite Arabic CD's of all time! I've had it for nearly a year and I never get tired of it.

0, over priced...under sized!: if you're small or a child you'd like the size of these....BUT no one would like how easily we used them one time and the body of one leaked and the pillow part of the other leaked...both at the seams! Third time we couldn't even use them...we had to keep getting off and blowing them back up! Save your money and go to the Dollar Store and get one for a few bucks! Won't be disappointed when they pop after three uses!
1, Excellent Salad Dressing: I eat salad a lot at least 4 or 5 times a week. So I have tried many different dressings. I came across this by accident as a friend gave it to me to try out. A new unopened bottle that ended up not lasting long. As far as Vinaigrette's go this one is one of my favorites. There is little I can say besides buy this you will love it. Their website has more flavors and cheaper prices so I recommend going there. I just ordered the Zesty French and I have no doubt it will be as good as all their other dressings.

1, the more music from jonah the better: I'm guessing most people are coming across gratitude because they follow and love the music jonah makes. I'd rather see his solo act (duo if you count his r2d2 side kick) onelinedrawing live than gratitude
0, You Have To Have A Lot Of Patience: You have to have a lot of patience to get through this album. It hosts mediocre songs with forgettable lyrics
1, understandable highest level science with cultural backg: The book covers a broad field - all parts in close connection with the others and its background in modern science and historic cultural connotations. The theoretical aspects are merged with lively explanations. Readable for the non-specialist

0, don't buy this: I bought 2 of these 1 for home and 1 for the office. I wish i could return them. this calculator doesn't work very well and I have made so many mistakes with thisI have lost confidence in their accuracy. Adding 16 numbers in a column on a tax form 6 times( you know add it then check it) I only got the same answer twice!!! and that turned out to be a wrong answer!!Division has similar fun results. I suspect the processors are faulty
0, Outdated information don't buy: The information in this book is outdated even when it was published. I learned more in 2 lectures on patent law while in university. Its has been made obsolete by more recent revisions by the USPTO.

0, Didn't Live Up to the Promises: Purchased this for my granddaughter's birthday and she wanted to try it out right away. 3 children and 2 adults tried to make these animals. Problem is it simply doesn't stay stuck together unless you make something simply like a round ball. The little plastic pieces would not stay for 2 seconds. It seems that in creating something that doesn't make a mess

1, Enjoyment of Learning about Egypt: I have been interested in Egypt virtually all my life
1, Great Game but 1 problem: I thought NBA Ballers for Playstation 2 was a great game. It gave me plentiful time of entertainment. I liked the clothing selection. I thought the graphics and the gameplay were great. The only problem that got on my nerves was it took a long time to load. I thought it would take forever to find a hairstyle/hat and other clothing that I liked.I LOVED the Rags to Riches Mode and TV Tournament.Overall it is good game and I would still buy it.(1-10)Graphics: 10Gameplay: 9Special Features: 10Loading: 1Moves: 9

1," hmmm... well it's good and noisy!!: The only reason i bought this cd is because i had heard ""Supernaut"" earlier and found it that the awesome vocals i heard WAS Trent!! Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) makes any album worth buying!! a shame that there isn't more tracks to it... but in all it's an ok cd... just one of those things you'd have to listen to in order to find out..."
1, Pros: Easy
0, Dissapointed: I am a hugh Chyna/Joanie laurer fan all information in this book was compiled from old magazines tv talk shows and her and Hunter's own behind the scence WWF video IT'SOUR TIME. This book did not produce any new information on her life. All it did was skim the surface and use other peoples' work to make this book. I hope the author shares his royalities with all the other writers and talk show host that provided him with their information
1, Also eagerly awaiting the next installment....: The reviewer who awarded this book one star obviously never glanced at a traditional stanza of ancient Egyptian poetry
1, Works great: Nice holster for hip placement
1, Solid Construction
1, Excellent and detailed reference: The coverage of the topic is broad and deep. It is one of the few introductory books that devotes some space to transfer function modeling and does so intelligibly.A must have for the novice as well as those more familiar with the topic that need a solid reference.

0, Disappointment to intelligent readers: I was so looking forward to the new adventures of Ms. Jones after finding her to be a loveable and indentifiable character in the previous book. However
0, This Book Is So OVERRATED! Don't get taken in!: Am I the only person in the world who is sick of hearing every new book compared to the Bridget Jones Diary? Reviewers have even shortened the book title to BJ or BJD. For as much praise the book is getting
1, Bridget's back!: I read the first book a couple of years ago and really loved Bridget
1, V. Fabulous: Totally loved it
1, Simply hilarious!: In short
0, Lost potential: THE EDGE OF REASON and Frank McCourt's 'TIS are classic examples of what gets lost when the authors are rushed into supplying sequels. Both of these books had enormous potential
1, As good as the first one !!!: The Edge of the reason is as good as the 1st diary. We can find the same kind of humor again...But it is not boring
0, Buy Something Else!: I read all the reviews before buying this hoop. I appreciated McElligot's review. Thanx for taking the time to write that
1, Excellent Book !!!: I own the book of Hammond Citation World Atlas b/c I had to buy it for a recreation class in college in the past. When I got done with that recreation class with the Hammond Citation I went ahead and kept the book instead of sold it back to the college book store since the book was very helpful to me in the future! I can alway use that book to look up what city/town or village population and etc. Kim
1, Drop 2 and get the new: With the departure of the original guitarists
0, Buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead: I purchased this one when my Conair spiral curling iron broke after 4 years. This Revlon curling iron does not get near as hot as the Conair and does not achieve near the curls as the Conair as the result. Don't waste your money on this one
0, Pointless and Misleading: If you want to consult the First Folio
0, MAKE IT STOP!!!!!: HONESTLY... IM DISSAPOINTED IN DIDDY. THIS CD IS CRAP AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING AMAZING. THE ONLY THING AMAZING ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING IS SARA. SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT OUT WHILE SHE HAD THE CHANCE AND BECOME A SOLO ARTIST. PLEASE... PLEASE... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. ITS SOOOO NOT WORTH IT.

1, A different Method to administer: I have used this product for over a year. It works fine. In the beginning she would take it on her food.

0, No big deal: I started using this product 1 month ago on my Maltese following the product instruction. So far
1, Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator: The product works great. We have seen a noticeable difference in a short period of time. We have a dog who was abused and bites when she is nervous. We were having a hard time keeping her eyes clean
0, can cause diarrea: Be aware that the anti biotic in this stuff kills the good bacteria in the dogs system.. While most dogs seem to tolerate it others do not. Ours started having black runny stool after only a few days. It will take away the tear stain!! I have to admit. We have tried several products
1, This stuff works!!!!!!: We've tried lots of things for tear staining prior to Angel Eyes. Within one week we could see a 50% reduction. In two weeks the stains were gone!!! If you're sitting on the fence with this product - Don't!!It works. It's wonderful. My dogs love the beef flavor. Excllent product!!!!! :o)
1, No More Tear Stain: I've had Angel's Eyes for about 3 weeks and I can already see an improvement in my dogs appearance. She's a cream colored poodle so the red tear stains were always very apparent. Since I've been giving her the supplement I've noticed a considerable difference. Her eyes still get a little weepy every now and again but I'm confident that with continued use she'll only improve. The only downside is that even though Angel's Eyes is liver flavored

0, Disappointing...: I have tried everything to help with the tear stains for my white poodle. So I was anxious to try this after seeing all the reviews. I have completed one 120 gm bottle and there has not been any change in the staining. In addition

1, A true Eye-Opener: This movie is great. With the recent Bush Administration blunders
0, Not My Favorite: I am a devoted reader of Ms. Perry's Monk & Pitt novels; but I must say that this book is a far cry from her best. Her character development is usually spot on and the reader usually has a myriad of possible culprits from which to choose. However

0, Stopped working after 1 month: I had this dryer for a month and liked it. The only thing I didn't like was that I kept accidentally shutting it off because of how the buttons are placed but put up with it. Then after 1 month of use
0, Didn't last 2 years: I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn't like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough. I've had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won't turn on anymore. I've had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/
1," Best hair dryer yet for long hair!: Had a more expensive Babyliss that died after only a few months. That was ""ionic"" and claimed to speed up drying for long hair (mine is colored as well). It didn't. Thought the whole ionic thing was just hype until I got this dryer. Wow! What a difference it makes in drying my hair. I have also noticed a huge improvement in the shine and smoothness in my hair after using this dryer - all the things I was expecting of the one I had before. I will never go back to the more expensive dryers. They are a waste of money not to mention disappointing. This one is a great value"

1, Hairdryer: I live in humid FLA- and this hairdryer does the trick. Dries fast and efficiently. The cool shot button works quickly. It's also lightweight and quiet.
1, Hot and light: This hair dryer is excellent for quickly drying your hair. I am able to dry my daugther's long hair in about 35 minutes. I purchased the T3 for this versatility
0," only worked for about 4 months !: and i mostly used it to tame my short bangs! i only used it to dry my entire head of hair about 7 times at most and the thing just stopped working. first the ""cold shot"" completey stopped working"

0, Boring and Long Going: I rated it 1/5 stars in the count of it keep dragging on and didn't hold my interest during my whole time readying the book.This book was boring. I had to read it for school for my sophomore year.

Also this book has a lot of violence

1, Let Go: This book was inspiring. It shows how little misunderstandings and bullying can easily get taken to far. It is about growing up and learning to let go.I thought it was a great book and it caused me to think when I read it. I also cryed. A good book makes you smile

It really isnt.Way it was written 4.5 out of 5Plot 5 out of 5Dialouge 3.5 out of five (Its all 60s stuff)For the people who watched the movie the book is better. The thing about it is that the I wish it could have lasted longer but it didnt.
1, Ponyboy Express: Well the reason i am typing this review is because we read this book in school and i tell you this the best book i have read. Ponyboy is my favorite character because in the book he always told it like it is. The Outsiders realy is a unique book because it shows people how it was back when people got jumped in the streets. I am going into college now and it is a good book to bring with me to read if i get bored. I thank my teacher for assinging the book to the class.
0, The Outsiders: The book i read was called the outsiders written by S.E Hilton. The theme is about a group of kids called the greasers. The greasers are made up of Ponyboy
0, The Outsiders: Puffin
1, The Outsiders: This is a great book to show the conflicts between the greasers and the socs. It will be a book that you never want to put down.
1," ""DA"" OUTSIDERS Rewiew: The greaser gang always help each other in hard times. when Johnny"
1," Has hot guys and great story line. What more do you need?: I loved this book it was really good. It even had a hidden sense of humor. In the movie you have got really hot guys too. Sodapop was my favorite and Dallas was my second favorite. This book is so good you'll never put it down. P.S (""That was then"
1, Well Done: This album is very cleverly done. If you are a Beatles fan you will appreciate how good the instrumentation is and how clever some of the touches are.
1, French Conversational by Pimsleur: Product was as promised - new
0, Don't be Foolish -- Get Something Else...: I brought this thing because I only needed something cheap for the bedroom. It worked alright
1, My eagle looks regal!: While other products may clean well
1, Thirty Year Old Piano...: I thought I would give this product a try. My parent's piano sat for thirty years without brass care for the pedals.I tried one buffing session and was amazed at the improvement. By the third go around I was starring into glass! I was surprised at the ease of use and low odor of this product.Now time to use brass lacquer.
0, Nothing worth sinking your teeth into: I'm definitely a fan of Laurell Hamiltons earlier works so I enjoyed her story. However
0, Hit or Miss: The product itself doesn't seem too bad
0, DraZonk: Not all that impressed - wasn't the easiest to put together and I had to hammer it out to make it fit. I almost feel like it was returned and slightly bent or something. Then
0, Great picture
0, Cannot Clean It: I recently bought a home with a backyard pond
0, Some good tracks but for the most part
1, Spiritual
0, Seems to run out of steam: This was probably the first attempt to tell the history of the 1892 Homestead Steel Strike since the books that came out in the 1890s very shortly after the event. It's hard
0, Anonymous Venetian: Have been a fan of Donna Leon since read first of Commissario Brunnetti's series. Enjoy the relationship he has with family and co-workers.Unfortunately I go through the books too fast.
0, Mostly Sesame Oil: This is a waste of money. It is not pure neem oil. This smells like it only has a little neem oil in it
0, Not so good score: Was hopeing it would be a bit better
0, I can't find Roy: I've just received a gift copy of Medal of Honor. I quickly turned to the page THE RECIPIENTS
1," Taylor is a star.: I am an ""oldies"" (Beach Boys"
1, Taylor Swift: Love the young singer's voice
1, Excellent offering from great new talent: When I first heard of Taylor Swift
0, Take some singing lessons
1, The Prodigal Daughter: Jeffrey Archer is always a good read. However
1," Extraordinary - healing: This book is absolutely remarkable. It is not only astonishing but also very informative and very comforting. I read it within a couple of hours and I sort of ""woke up"" moved"
0, He advocates the killing of gays: In his music
1, GREAT TV: I don't know what these other people are talking about. This TV is great. I haven't had any problems with it and the colors are great!
1, A very good book about international law.: Beside some edition flaws (like the date issue) Malcom N. Shaw is a very good book about international
0, Horrible Shipping Cost and Customer Service: I contacted this seller to ask why shipping cost was so high with no answer. I was charged $30.00 shipping for a $4.80 bag that the item came in. I will never purchase from this seller again and I recommend to all buyers on Amazon to stay away from this seller. Customer service is horrible!!!
1, Used to be shy: I used to be scared to talk to people. By practicing the book I learned how to make both male and female friends and be a good conversationalist.
1, Must Read for Everyone: After being on my must read list for years
1, Do not be fooled by the Title: This book should be a required reading in any school. It teaches you how to relate to people and be compassionate
1, A Timeless Classic with Principles that still apply today!: Although originally written several decades ago
1, A must read for all people that come in contact with anyone!: If you are in sales or any job or profession where you are in contact with people
0, How to Win Friends and Influence People: The new book came on time and as ordered but the quality was very poor. The pages were light yellow
1, One of the most important book I have ever read: I wish I had read this book earlier in my life
1, Great book!: We are currently using this book as a learning experience to deal with our clientele better. It's been really helpful in stressful situations
1, A very good book to increase your attraction power: This book may look like some stupid guide to get friends. But that a way more subtle than that. Dale Carnegie is a great personal development specialist who studied the way we interact with each other and the simple things we should take care of to get more influence on people. Must Read !
1, Great!: This is a book that all people should read from teenagers to retirees. If you have a family
1, A Must Read: I consider this a must read book for anyone who wants to improve their career or just how they interact with people. The book is an easy read and filled with interesting stories showing how Dale Carnegie's tactics can work in everyday life. I think it will be a book that I re-read several times.
1, the best audio you can get: You want to become a better person
1, An eye opener: It's a great book that really drives home some important messages on how to handle people. This can be a real eye opener for some people.
1, Influence for the better: If a book can change the way you talk with people on a day to day basis for the Better it is a good read in my opinion. When I finished reading this book I did not notice a change
1, Review of How to Win Friends and Influence People: This is a concise guide in the art
1, Great!: Timeless advice and a charismatic delivery make this book enjoyable and likely to be acted on and revisited throughout your life. It will open your eyes wider
1, Surprisingly Easy Read: Found this book very interesting & I think it will be helpful. I downloaded it to use with my direct sales business.
1, I recommend it to anyone- with friends or no friends!: This book will make you really think about about how to treat people. I think the best advice he gave that really hit home for me is to not criticize people
0," Need a reality check: I work in the field of abused children. I felt this book did not hold the women accountable for their actions. The author's basically gave them a ""free pass"" in life by making excuses. It does not matter if you are rich"
1, it was great!: hi this book was great! it is about this girl named clarice bean a she tries to solve a mystery along with her friend. read the book to find out what happens! do they find the cup? or not?
1, Can't get more bang for the buck.: I'm not an audiphile
1, Missy E song: I also would like to know what that remix on Missy's song is playing in the club and where I can find it!! Please someone reply-thanks!!
0, needs improvement: The idea of having a dictionary as big as the one advertised in this module is great. How many times have you wanted to look up a word only to stop yourself because you didn't want to open up that huge book? Even for those of us who have internet connections to look up words easily
0, Not recommended: Oi vey! What an odd book. If you enjoy talking to yourself and shouting at the top of your voice for a few hours a day
0," What a load of ****: Dan couldn't motive Punxsutawney Phil to look for his shadow. Where does he come up with this stuff? It's so clearly a bad rehash of other self-help books. Did he even do any research? And what makes him qualified to ""teach"" this stuff? Maybe Martha Stewart heard him speak. If companies really do hire him"
0, Space junk: Space Ace is in the line of Dragon's Lair and other similar point and click game play. I am not against this genre completely but it has some inherent problems. Timing is crucial to beating the game and is rather unforgiving. This leads to starting over numerous times
1, DL is still better
0, Here's a Problem....: The book states that Curly was never a member of the Howard family. Why then
0, Hard to believe: I read the book and I find it very hard to believe.I read a ton of other books on Curly which seem true.This book claims Curly did not die in the early fifties but in the seventies. But Curly did die in the early fifties as there is proof!This book does not even talk about Curly's famous brothers
0," Nonfiction or Novel?: Check out the publisher's website (iuniverse.com). They describe this book as ""a novel based on fact"". Webster's Dictionary defines a novel as ""a fictitious prose narrative of considerable length"". The publisher's description falls short of true non-fiction"
0, Beyond The Laughter: why
1, STILL HOLDS HER OWN: Even though her lyrics are all reworkings of the same theme - devotion to a love that has been lost -
1," Don't agree with the Amazon review on Dónde están...?: The first time I listened ""Inevitable"" on Mtv I thought it was a great song"
0, Unoriginal: I really found this album unoriginal. I've read the artist admires Alanis Morissette and this album sounds as if Alanis had made a bad spanish record. It's evident in the singer's style that Alanis is an inspiration
1, holy smokes this is one of the best cds ever: This cd has it all. Shakira does a great job writing plus each song has a completely different feel. On this cd there are virtually NO BAD SONGS. I've found only one song slightly boring and on occasion I do actually want to hear even it. Shakira has an awesome voice too that really reflects the moods of the songs. If you are still wondering about this cd than i have one more thing to tell you. I wouldn't say i don't like music but i am not a superfan that can't stand not having music on. A lot of times i buy a cd and listen to it for a month or two then never again. This is one of the cd's that is in my permanent folder. It just never gets boring.
1, Best Album I've heard since Jagged Little Pill: Just buy it. She's got great pipes and the CD rocks. ALL the songs are good. You won't be disappointed. (I don't speak Spanish
1, Christ Farley and Jesus: ever see Tommy Boy and feel joy?that's the real Jesus
0, A Major Disappointment: I was very excited to get this module. I remember having had a franklin electronic bible years ago and I was hoping to have that convenience again. Unfortunately
1, Amazing book: Wow!Reading these reviews makes me totally smile. Like all of the rest
1, Dance dvd: I enjoyed all the fast paced
1," The Force of Reason: A comprhensive expose' of Islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in America that the Muslims are ""just like us""."
0, The Force of Lunacy: Poor Oriana Fallaci does it again
1, Oriana's overview of Radical Islam: Quite a book! A lot of information not read in the daily media. Oriana brings her lifes work and experiences to bear on a topic that she is very agitated about
1, Nice cute little thing!!: Its really nice. I bought it because i have always wanted one. The sound is very nice. But the middle part keeps giving out weird noise whenever i streched it....it might be because its new... Hope it will go away soon.. Overall a very good toy!!
0, good quality: good quality
1, One of the great westerns: This ground breaking film depicts the true feelings of the West and the desperate men who were outlaws. The cinematography is excellent
0, Doesn't hold up well: I don't care how much people praise this film
1, Track listing...: Tracks...1) Shoop (Album Version)2) Shoop (Guru's Mix)3) Shoop (Danny D's R&B; Mix)4) Let's Talk About Aids5) Shoop (Instrumental)6) Shoop (Acapella)7) Emphatically No8) I've Got Aids (PSA)
0, This cd seemed to short change us the fans: This is one more Rosemary Clooney cd that I have added to my collection. It's really not one to write home about. Let me try to explain my less than enthusiastic feeling about this cd. I think that the idea to record a cd with the great Count Basie Orchestra was grand one. As far as the orchestra goes they did their thing. They delivered a whale of a performance. Where the real problem areas came from are at Rosemarys' end.First off
0, garbage: This album can be summed up in one word-garbage. She makes it well known that this work was meant to frighten [take note the warning writted on the front of the CD: Contains genuinely scary material. Use caution when listening alone or in the dark.] Predicting how we will feel toward the music makes it safe to say she intended no interpretation or subtlety at all in her work.. which makes for an entirely uninteresting piece.I tried in vain to make myself 'feel' the music
0, too short of a life: I was very pleased with this tv for the first two years. Great picture
0, It's a joke: Very bad selection of songs
1, Simply; Good and Enjoyable !!: Simply; Good and Enjoyable. Nothing that you haven't already heard before! Just a nice compilation of some of the same superb Good Old Classics. No enhancements or Digitally Remastered or any thing else
1, Never Forget Your Best Friends: I give this book five stars. It was a great book
0, James and the Giant Peach DVD: The DVD won't play in this region. I didn't even know there were regions! However
1, Sam's report: James and his friends are about to discover the greatest thing in their life. There is a lot of excitement
0, DVD - Horrible. Scratched and skips. VERY used.: Horrible quality item and it is unbelievable they would send this. It was scratched and skips. The DVD was VERY used.
1, Fill Yourself with Peach Delight!: This wonderful fantasy book is filled with tremendous fun for people that love to read magical fairy tale ages 8-13. This story has sad no-reason punishments and exciting revenge. I really recommend kids ages like me to read this book. To me
0, Not (typical) Disney Animation - nearly black and white: We rented this for New Years Eve for our family to watch together. We only watched maybe the first 20 minutes - none of us were enjoying it. The promotional poster/picture they show is NOTHING like the movie animation - the movie is nearly black and white - very very little color except the peach. The first 15 minutes or so are real people then it morphs into a Tim Burton typical cartoon-like animation. Blech. If it looked like the picture they advertise the movie with and had vibrant colors like that - mixed with typical Disney and/or Pixar animation it would have been a fantastic movie but no one wanted to watch it the way it is. I don't recommend. This version was creepy and the lack of color was depressing. Hoping Pixar picks up James and the Giant peach - think they could make a fantastic version.
0, Perfect for Children; Fails to Entertain Adults: All children should see this
1, THE REAL THING: I was born in Brazil
0, Defective: Overall a very nice case. Fits an SG special very nicely with adequate support of neck and body. I have no doubts this case would protect the guitar in flight. However
1, Garmin 201 Forerunner: This is a great motivator for every single run. Provides a much better idea on how far
0," Customer beware: A word of caution.I bought this product in the US.Only to find out upon received it in Europe that it will not work w/the included power supply.So no option but to buy an extra power converted 220V at $ 30+.Is this what it's called a ""personal"
1, A Great device for the money!: I recenty purchased the Forerunner 201 and have been very pleased with its performace and overall ease of use. I've used it in both CA and Colordo and have yet to have any problems with getting and keeping a signal. In fact
0, Replaced and works well!: UPDATED SEE BELOW:This was a useful device but it broke within 3 months of my purchase.After 3 months the forerunner stopped working all together. Reset
1, garmin forerunner 201well worth it: Bought this for my husband who is training for a marathon
1, Excellent product: What a great product! I downloaded the newest software on the garmin site and have had no problems at all with the gps signal. What a great device! It is a must for both the casual and avid runner! Very easy to use! Updated software is available online.
0, Garmin Forerunner 201: I bought my Forerunner about 3 months ago and have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is it's tendency to lose the satellite signal. If you intend to use this for trail runs....forget it. Even running along a road with trees next to the shoulder is enough to drop the signal. Once that happens
1, hard to charge after a while: I am absolutely addicted to my Forerunner 201. After a year or so
0, Industry Group: Bad Enough their first album Sold Tons Of Records.but then Smooth With Rob Thomas&Santana Took Off.what a Bad Joke.this Album is a Cross Between Hootie&The Blowfish
1, Great Softrock: If you are into softrock you will probably like Matchbox 20's 2nd CD
1, Just like fine wine: Seeing it took the boys of Matchbox
1, Great album!!!: I bought this album because I'd heared 3 songs from it on the radio and I liked them. My favorite songs that i hadn't heard on the radio were Last Beautiful Girl (because that's always how I feel after a guy that I have a crush on is mean to me)
1, Great
1, Better than their first: When I bought this cd
0, mad season: This album gets very boring. After hearing Bent millions of times on the Radio
0, Wow
1, Fabulous!!: This album is sheer class. I bought Yourself Or Someone Like You after hearing about 10 seconds of 3am. Ten seconds was all it took for me to become an enormous fan of this excellent group. Every single song is exceptional
1, Radio friendly music for the new decade....: As good as MB-20's first CD is
0, What were they thinking?: This new offering from Matchbox 20 is nothing like their 1st album. They have definitely gone over to the dark-side of soft rock. It is way too mellow for my taste.
0," Not as great as the other one's: When I herd ""mad season"" I said to myself ""this is machbox 20? "" becuse it was slow music not the speed as like the one before! ""I did't like it"""
0, Not what quality I'm used to from Acorn!!: I have an ancient pair of Acorn slip-ons that I just cannot throw out because they are my absolute favorite casual shoes. They are in great condition
0, Goofy Waffle Maker: I had purchased this on price alone and while it provided many years of trouble free service
1," Perfect sound: Suberb sound. An example for DVD-music. Beautiful ambience. The music follows the typical Cuba sound so it does not follow the original sound tracks as recorded on his previous albums (like ""live in London""). Therefore"
0, don't waste your money: the plastic pieces of this hoop straightened out after a short period of time (in a few short weeks)
1, Excellent American Bird Reference: The color plates for this book were made before the War. It blends the scientific with the popular facts on birding. I chose this book for the detailed color plates in which to paint birds. It contains the life
0, Cracked 1st time: I got this piece and couldn't wait to try it out. In the oven it went at 325 degrees and BOOM
1, Good quick read: A very nice book
0, Don't ever purchase from this place.: I bought this early December of 2006
1, Good Item to have for sp: This is good product to have dont get me wrong but they should have made a flame and onyx color but i understand but it is a good kit to have to be listening to the radio and playing super mario bros 3. now i bought a ultimate pak and it was only $50.00 and it is a whole lot better.
0," Awful Movie and Video To Boot: Everybody knows that this MAY be even worse than ""Plan 9"" or ""Manos The Hands Of Fate"" and it is. The only problem with this Alpha Video release is that the source print is the worst I have EVER seen. I cannot believe a better print was not available. Avoid this and go with the DVD from Image."
0, Bevare!: Cool title
0, Dangerous side effects: My doctor gave me Thorne Profusia-SR to improve my circulation and
0," The title is accurate--plain.: I was not impressed. The book read ""just ok."" It filled up reading time"
0, Literary critics seem to like things that are depressing.: It's interesting to me that some of the best books have critics turn their noses up at them because they are truly inspiring and uplifting -- unlike Plainsong
1, Wise and humane: An enjoyable read
1, Plainsong Review: Plainsong. The first english book that I actually liked reading through out high school. It draws you in and doesn't let you go until you are finished. Haruf opened my eyes to the real world out there. Before this book I never realized how tough life is for everyone. I give this book four stars. I don't like to read much but I actually liked to pick up this book and read it.
0," Madison County Redux: PLAINSONG is just plain sorry! What has happened to the American reader's intellect? I'm not opposed to ""dumbing down"" in order to clarify if an author's writing about"
1, A Delight!: One of the best books I've read this year. I fell TOTALLY in love with the McPheron brothers! From page one
0, Plainsong: As part of a book club
1," Resonating People: Kent Haruf's ""Plainsong"" is a down to earth"
0, Plainsong: The book is in OK condition. It has yellow pages making it look older than what it really is. I could have bought another book for $1 more and not yellow -- easier to read.Plainsong
1, Heartwarming
1," Felt as though I was right there: This had the same quality as ""Snow Falling on Cedars""--the atmosphere was so much a part of the story. Having lived in a rural area of the country for 13 years"
1, A must read!: I hadn't really expected much of Plainsong on picking it up at the libray - not my usual type of book. However
1, Impressive Mini Series: This is a wonderful movie about an anchient chinese story. The Journey To The West is a book on a scholar that travels to a different world. The movie has great effects and the characters fill the standards of the book. If you love magic and adventure this movie is good. Also if you were interested in movies like: Merlin
1, More Than a Fantasy: While I seriously condsidered turning it off after the first ten minutes because it looked stupid
1, a terrific yarn!: a long story
1, damn good shoe: bought these for work and for concerts (mosh pits etc). comfy from day 1
1, Strawberry Sparkle Cake: This pan worked out fine. My cake came out just right. The packaging was fine and I would reccommend this merchant on this particular item.
0, My least favorite Album: I only like 2 tracks of this album
0, Disapointed: Im a big of them. Alot of the songs didnt go anywhere at werent catchy at all. There previous albums all were great. Theres nothing that comes close to The Cage
1," Very enjoyable: This is the first book by Forster I've ever read and I enjoyed it a great deal.Forster takes the time to present a world to us while being explicit about what he is leaving out (the ""very poor""). In this book"
0, Half a Good Book: Roger Kahn has shamelessly used the attraction of the great Brooklyn Dodgers to lure people into reading what turns out to be his autobiography/confession/pyscho-therapy session. Instead of concentrating his entire effort on the great Dodger players of the 50's he exposes the reader to his own childhood of overbearing parents
0," Very dissapointing: If you are expecting an insightful potrait of baseball in 1950's Brooklyn look elsewhere. What this book delivers instead is a re-heated version of ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" The author is so self-absorbed that any baseball lore one may find in the book must be washed down with a large dose of his syrupy personal saga. Along the way Kahn manages to drain all the vitality out of baseball and replace it with warm tapioca pudding."
0, Small fit: For a big and tall pant
0," A little short: I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36"". I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual. A little more attention to detail please. The inseam was 35 1/2"". When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2' makes a big difference."
1, The Best Toy in the World!!!: This is my favorite toy in the whole world. I play with it every day and it sleeps with me and my stuffed animals evry night. Sometimes we pretend we go to the moon together and we go there in the big red car. Other times we go to the rainforest. At night Anthony fights off clowns and wears a ninja suit. This toy has saved my life many times from evil clowns. He is my favorite toy.
0, Bad Religion's worst release: I'm a huge Bad Religion fan and love their newer stuff but this is just subpar. I don't have a problem with the slower style of writing...the songs are just plain bad. There's no catchy choruses or anything. Greg's lyrics arn't even that good. I'd only recommend this to die hard BR fans and even they should buy it used.In it's defense there are three decent songs. You've Got A Chance
0, ever band has one bad album: and this is it....this is just real bad....im mean burn it and forget about it bad....
1, brilliant and overlooked: This series has lately been dismissed by shallow art history charlatans who relish theory over the connoisseurship of the eye. Clark suffers only from the irresistible urge to tell the truth; some cultures are more exquisite and developed than others
1, A really good record: As a fan of Wilco
0, unplayable flippers = ripoff: I bought this a week ago and have watched 5 movies. The first four all had multiple corrupted zones and the fifth doesn't even load. At all. I am going to have to reboot the machine to get the dvd out. This set has good movies in it
1, Very nice set but.... very hard to find your movie: Very nice set of movies
1, Clint: Great movies. It was a gift and my husband loved it. Howeve
1, CC or HOH? Nope!: Great set but no closed caption. No hard of hearing. Oh
0, spanish subs?: I need to know if there are spanish subs for all the movies. Also if they are dubbed into spanish. It would be great to know. Thanks. I hope somebody can answer before the deal finish.
0, Not Good: I bought two sets of these towels. One of the sets faded immediately upon the first use. The towels have a good feel
1, Very high quality towel: This towel is a very lush
0," Where is the speech?????: This home made DVD has everything except what it's suppose to have...The actual ""I have a dream speech""!! It goes right up to the moment MLK is introduced to the podium and then dissolves to him leaving!!! Don't buy unlees you want B-fotage of the event!!"
1, Mio P550: Very good GPS
1, Very Good GPS for money: I think that this is very functional and well executed device. Once you get used to the software it is accurate and easy to use. Very good car mount which allows for many configurations inside your car.WiFi and Bluetooth both work well and fast.Windows Mobile is not any worse or better then other hand held PC. Messaging and sinchronization work OK and this could be reasonable travel companion rather then laptop. You do need to carry a charger since battery life is short. You get couple hours if you use your energy saving mode.
1, Love this book: I have tried about 4 receipes from this book and the hubby and two young children and my self have all been very happy with them and they are reasonable ingredients to obtain
0, I already have a cookbook: I really bought this book because I have two small girls and I wanted my family to be the family who cooks dinner every night and eats at the dinner table instead of feeding the babies and us eating later. So I thought this would be more of a workbook or something to help me accomplish this. Okay
1, Refreshing encounter with a great mind: Dewey's philosophy is hard for some people to get into
1," Great experimental fiction: A great book because it makes you realize a story does not have to be told sequentially and thus makes you question the nature of time - a theme central to the book's plot. If you like this you also will probably like Zelazny's ""Doorways in the Sand"" and ""Lord of Light."""
1, Great Doll!: AS the previous reviewer said
1, YUM: Swine and Roses...what a great song. It must be my favorite TKK song so far. Very great to dance to at a club. The bass is perfect and the vocals are superbly done.
1, Amazing little space savers: If you are a gadget junky like me you can understand the frustration of only being able to use 3 or 4 of the outlets in your 6 outlet power strip. It drives me up a wall that all these transformer boxes for your PDAs
1," Eat to the Beat for the Millenium!: Don't expect an album of ""Good Boys"" and other dance tracks"
1, Blondie's Only Curse is Talented Songwriting: Debbie Harry has always been The Queen of the double-entandra
1," Excellent ""Modern Day"" Blondie!!!! An Excellent CD!!!!: There have already been plenty of reviews on this one"
0, Ehhh...: This video is alright. Eric Roberts is not very believable as a young school aged boy
0, disapointed: I really Like Mr Liddy and was hoping that this book would give me more of the Liddy Style
1, A Very Funny Document: Vertiginous Falls Descend through Vast Frigid Domains! Vicious Flies Dart! Villainous Felons Destroy Valuable Fortress! Don't vacillate from despair
1, Volunteer Fire Department: Here we find ourselves
1, The Slippery Slide: Just imagine that you are a three-year-old orphan with a fortune in trust funds worth millions of dollars. This would be great
1," More music from heaven . . .: I really doubted that there could be a SW recording that could rival ""Sacred Ground"""
0, Beautiful Music -- Not Chanting: If you've experienced 'live' chanting
0, Poorly Written: Sounds like a man who desperately needs to be accepted by those around him
1, Fascinating Take on the Film Industry - 1970's and Beyond: A fascinating take on the film industry from both an agent's/producer's point of view. A number of the films he's had a direct handle in are amongst my all time favorite list and it's interesting to read backstage stories about the process
0, Un-realized potential: Being a person who found Garland's well-reviewed THE BEACH to be nothing more than a re-hashing of LORD OF THE FLIES
1, DIDN'T FIT THE LAWN TRACTOR: I had used this kit on my Huskie 38 inch Lawn tractor. It fit perfectly. My friend's dad just bought a Huskie 42 inch. Both models are made by MTD. WE FIGURED THAT THIS KIT SHOULD ALSO FIT THE 42 INCH
1, Ghosts
0, Hamlet! More like Spamlet!: I don't know what Willy Shakespeare was thinking when he wrote this one play tragedy
1, Oh baby are you meant for me?!!!!: I absolutely am on fire about this CD cuz it's hot!!!! The hi-hat repetition is so much fun that I can't contain myself!!! Plus who can beat a name that's so much fun to say as
1, Dialogues with God: Mrs. Roberts has authored several books and I have read them all. Their content comes from a lady with a very deep and personal relationship with God. Her words are very inspiring and leads to a closer walk with the Lord. They are of much help when seeking guidance as we walk daily seeking a new and fresher walk with the Lord. I would give each of them a five star rating.I have spoken personally with Mrs. Roberts and she is a very gracious lady.Margaret C. Duran/Author of Life In Satan's Grip and others.

1, A worthy sequel: I loved Interview with the Vampire so I went out and got this book. I absolutly loved it. I thought Louis and Lestat were the most interesting characters in the first book so I was dying to read more about Lestat. In this book
1," The best in the series.: This was the best book in the ""vampire"" series. It was well thought out and well written. It's slow at parts"
0," WHY ALL THE SADNESS?: I loved and still do the first book ""Iterview with the vampire."" And my hopes were so high for this one....but I didn't want all the sadness"
1, hands down the best character in contemporary literature: This most wonderful of characters is well defined and excellent in his description. Anne Rice has a real talent for drawing in the reader with not only vivid description but the human and emotional aspects. In this book we learn of Lestat's rich past and mischievous present tales. A complicated character but certainly one that everyone loves to hate. Probably because he represents humanity in all its wonderful and dread realities. A must read for anyone.
0, Spare yourself!: I LOVE to read everything and anything and I have this weird thing about finishing books no matter how bad they are. Well in this case I couldn't even finsish no matter how hard I tried (and at that point I just wanted to finish to get it over with).I read Interview with the Vampire and I struggled with it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I saw the movie first and figured that is probably why I didn't like it. So I decided to give Lestat a chance and I am sorry I ever did. I found this book to be very boring. It moved at a very slow pace and I gave up waiting for it to get good. I'm sure how so many people can love this book and consider it a great piece of literature?! I definitely will not be reading any more of Anne Rice's books.
0, People! Anne Rice is not THAT great: I made the mistake of reading the reviews on all on Anne Rice before reading any of her work. From readin the reviews

0," Emeril disappointed me.: I purchased the Emeril Cast Iron 10"" square grill pan based on recommendations on Amazon. I found that the pan did not live up to myexpectations at all.

0, Did not live up to expectations.: Have used this product for several weeks and have seen absolutely no difference. Definitely will not purchase again. On the other hand they sent me a sample of Truth Revealed Super Creme which has been phenomenal! Within about two weeks of using it I began receiving all sorts of compliments in regards to how great my skin looks (I am 50). I am not kidding - my skin looks youthful and glowing. Ordered more immediately. Thanks for the sample Ole!
0, Poor Quality: These are SMALL!!!! The feathers get ink on your palms and back
0, hard to wear: The quality of the feathers are good. The wings look great. But what's up with the super long arm straps? Instead of sitting on my shoulder blades like they do on the model on the packaging

1, The best: this judy garland box set is wounderfull it has songs i never heard before and i have over 20cds not includig the ones in my boxed sets. if anyone out there loves judy garland or has never heard her give it a try i like it maybe you will? So buy a cd that dosen't have so many songs or just sample some songs right here in amazon.com.
0, Aw man!: So much promise but so little effort! This really could have been done well but wasn't. My love for Adam West and Burt Ward were the only reasons I got this. Frank Gorshin's Riddler was a delight to see again as well!
1, love it!!!!: love it.. it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..

1, They're still going strong!: It's been a few years now since buying this set and they still work like the day we got them! The coating is still perfect
0, Like White Bread: I love Sesame seeds and Whole Grain Rye. This is however all Wheat flour and tastes like white bread. It is also a smaller 7 oz instead of 9.8 oz.Less of an inferior product. Notice it is manufactured in Germany and not Sweden.
1, It's a Snap N Go--Great!: You will love this item because1. Small Car space--folds into the trunk of my camry2. Lightweight--for those w/weak arms3. Easy to maneuver.But be sure to download the manual from the maker's website beforehand to check which models go with this. Perfect since I got a handme down infant carrier that worked from a friend. A shame I can't continue with this same model. Wish the basket below held more than 5 lbs.Car Seat expert also told me you really don't need to go with those heavy transportation systems. A snap n go and umbrella stroller is fine if you're cost conscious and heft conscious depending on your needs. Good luck.
1, Great for airline travel: I purchased this carrier to use with my Peg Perego infant carseat when we took our first flight after the baby was born. I use the bugaboo frog system primarily
1, Great first stroller: We live in the city and loved the easy fold
1, Great stroller frame
1, Bloody
0, Get this book at Amazon.co.uk instead!: The book offered on the US Amazon uses volume instead of weight. This is a very inaccurate way of baking. Things will come out too dry or too soggy because a cup of flour can be too densely packed or too fluffy. Weighing will always be more consistent
1, Got bread?: Lay-flat binding for the definitive book on bread
1, Lovely Little Christmas Cookbook: I purchased this book for my sister-in-law
1, Intrigue In the Gold Country: Matt Bourdoul joined a wagon train because the beautiful Jacquine Coyle and her family would be traveling on it. He knows there is something wrong because they are going to the gold country. Matt feels the danger and he must find out the plans of this wagon train before it is too late. Louis L'Amour is very descriptive of the setting and his characters. He paints a vivid story of danger

1, Over-rated: This game is a puzzle game. I personally feel that the reviews are too over-rated for what it's worth. It's kind of like Bejeweled except you can only line up blocks vertically

0, Very Disappointed: The music and songs are great except on every song
1, Last of our set: We were very please to get the first book of the set
0, Leak problem: The first day i inflated to see if it worked and like in 5 minutes of inflating i noticed that it would lose air. This Air Bed Sucks it Doesnt WORK!!
1, Pleasantly surprised: We got this because it was the cheapest double high queen inflatable we could find with decent reviews. The documentation states it's for indoor use only but we actually took this camping which worked fine. While plenty thick and durable I'd say it does seem slightly more fragile than ones made for the outdoors. If you're going to take this same route you'll need to have a way to provide AC power to it. In our case we just used an inverter connected to the car and a long extension cord.

1, Gene Wilder continues to be the Candy Man: Seeing a re-make come out of the absolute classic that defined such a piece of my pre-pubescent youth gave me plenty of doubt that Mr. Depp could pull off anything like the original. Yes
1," Johnny Depp at his best: I love this movie...Johnny Depp is always good at what he does...I personally think he's great in this movie. I would have preferred if they had a ""making of"" in the special features section"
0, No joy
1, Burton and Dahl are quite compatible: The Bottom Line:This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version
1," Outstanding flick!: Johnny Depp is perfect as the ""eccentric"" candy man. Deep Roy and the rest of the cast are terrific too! And the music and CGI are perfect. What a fun"
0, a poooor excuse for a remake...or simply ANY movie!!!: i originally thought that bc tim burton directed this mooovie...that i world be a great one
0, Progress is not always good: Tim Burton
0, Can never beat the original: Though Tim Burton is a great director of magical movies and Johnny Depp is a terrific actor you cant beat an all time classic at all. the original will always be better because it was great
0, strange and creepy: i found this movie to be nothing what i expected. obviously hoping that it'd be a fun
1, I wanted to not like it
0, Very bad movie!: I only give this 2 stars because of the special effects and I am a easy going guy. But this movie sucked. Depp is portrayed as an idiot
0, Depp Looks like a girl.: I HATED THIS MOVIE IT DID NOT STICK TO THE PLOT A AND JOHNNY DEPP LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.
1, More like the Book: More true to form than the original version that starred Gene Wilder
0, couldnt sit through it: absolutely awful! I am a huge Johnny Depp fan
0, It may have been good...: I dont know because I fell asleep 20 minutes into it. What a boring scrum-diddly-DUD. I'll take the original with all its flaws. At least it kept me awake and wasnt a shallow reminder of a time when substance was more important than style.
1," THIS ISN""T A REMAKE OF THE GENE WILDER MOVIE! IT'S ACTUALLY A CLOSER ADAPTION OF THE ROALD DAHL BOOK!: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a good movie and Johnny Depp is superb as Willy Wonka!I have been reading reviews by numbskulls saying that they should never had made this movie and that it was a disgrace to remake a classic 70's movie like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory well FYI: This is not a remake of the Gene Wilder movie it is actually a much more closer adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl so anyone saying that this movie should never have been made and that it was wrong to make a different movie than the one that starred Gene Wilder well they really should pick up a book once in a while because than they would see that there was a book that came before the Gene Wilder movie and that this Johnny Depp version is closer to that book!"
0, Lame and disturbing: This was a really creepy rendition of a great classic movie. Even thought the special-effects are many times better
1," Surprisingly Decent: I had expected to absolutely hate this film going in as I love the original and was surprised to find I didn't. Definitely darker in some ways than Gene Wilder's version which I think is why I am able to disentangle the two in my head. Biggest downside to the film was all of the Wonka ""back story"" - totally unnecessary in my opinion and bogged the film down a bit."
0, This book sucks I want to leave negative five stars - *****: If you are interested in Huna do not buy this book. It is sad that books like this are written. If you want attention
1, Don't miss this one!: A must have album! Nothing in the world can bring tears to my eyes like the voice of the young Mary Travers as in 500 miles and There is a Ship. I was hoping that when the album was re-mixed that they would lower the volume of the applause after each song
1, GREAT BOOK FOR SPORTS FANS BY:KELSEY K: Honus and Me is a great book. It's about this little boy named Joe. He loves to collect baseball cards. One day he bought a pack of cards and found a one-of-a-kind Honus Wagner card

0," Rwcord quality problem.: I made two attempts to buy this new edition of Tupelo Honey and both had defects. On both albums defects were found on ""Old Woodstock"" and ""I want to roo you"" After the second one had the same issue as the first I asked for a refund. I would be wary of this pressing until we see that the quality control has improved. On the bright side it was simple and easy to do the returns with Amazon. A great job on the Amazon customer service side of the issue."
1," Happy with this CD: Rare song ""Tupelo Honey"" is on this CD. Along with a couple other hits.I got what was promised. Sound quality is good.I would recommend this product."
1, Certainly the place to start-- the very best survey: I read this in its original 1967 edition when I was very young
0, Wrong one!: I had hoped to surprise my sister with a movie of the 'Blue Rosé' for Christmas...one where we had watched together as children in the 60's. Two days after Christmas she called to tell me it was an earlier version that had no talking! I paid for the deluxe version and it was the wrong one...now I have a movie I will never watch.. Just be careful you read everything because I obviously didn't..
0, Too old: My husband
1, Neat Product: I added these as stripes to our office space and I was able to accomplish just the look I was going for (retro chic). The colors are fun and added some zest to our light grey walls. It was my first time using wall-pops so it took me a minute to get the hang of hanging them. The best part is that they are removable and can be reapplied over and over
1, Awesome: I like Black Sabbath - the originals. My favorite albums are the first six but I am looking forward to the new one in April 2013 performed by the original members.
0," STILL waiting for a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"": I just don't understand why record companies release CD after CD calling them new and improved. CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact. It's still low-resolution 16 bit old technology.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson"

1, Crime and Punishment: Definitely a 4 star read. I read this book in college and now again and it remains a literary classic. This style is sometimes hard to follow with the Russian names but well worth your time.

1, Muy Bien: I have always wanted to learn Spanish and so I have bought several things to help. This is by far the best of them because i actually took this on an eight hour trip with a family member and we loved learnign from it. It is correct when it says you learn spanish quickly. So if you buy it and are taking a trip stop at an authentic Mexican place and try out your new found knowledge after disc #2. You will surprised what you know about the language.

1, The best Dead CD recorded: Working Man's Dead depicts everything the Dead stood for (Garcia rest in harmony). This recording is a classic because of the jazzy themes and the bluegrass genre. Uncle John's Band being my favorite song of all times because of the pure optimisim and the methodical rhythm. Can't complian here! And I would recommend this CD to first time listeners of the Dead because it is easy to follow and even easier to love. two thumbs up!
1, Ballin' that jack...: The 8 track version of this lived in my player for 3 months back in the '70's! Great production

1, Pleasant: This CD Is OK- i liked all their other albums better (though I havent heard gish yet...) Siamese Dream was the best. And this comes in 4th.But I still really like this. My favorite song is Stand Inside Your Love- the lyrics are very moving. I also like Glass and Ghost Children

0, really flat: Billy Corgan is a very dull artist.the Lyrics are more self-pity than anything else.if he wants to willow in saddness and do it right then listen to Van Morrison.the music sounds flat and desperate.theirs no Life in the Smashing Pumpkins music.this disc at best is 2nd rate outtakes.Billy Corgan needs to get over himself and become a Artist again.he is just a Spoil Rich Brat.stop with the WHimp Lyrics and Write some Real songs for a change.the music is Weak as well.

0, pumpkins = god! 2000 shooting stars: if you want to hear what the pumpkins sound like listen to siamese dream and gish if you want to hear what a huge ego sounds like through speakers listen to adore and machina machina is even worse than the ever boring adore because it is obvious that smashing pumpkins are a moneyhungry and trying to imitate what sold the most records i hope billy finds a way to occupy his time other than making his band look like saints of rock! they are styx of this generation! ha ha i didnt get why kurt c HATED billy corgan until adore was released and this goes on prove it even more! bury it next 2 your spice girls cd!

Monroe is the Tony Robbins of the entertainment biz. I have felt a renewed sense of direction and power over my life since reading this book. Everything that Monroe says is right on the money and he gives the reader a great lookout on everyday aspects of our lives.If you haven't read this or Monroe's other book From Benning and Back pick them both up and get motivated today....

1," An excellent introduction and reference for the theory and fundamentals: This is a text book for engineers (electrical and mechancial primarily) to learn about various kinds of electric machines and their fundamental theories of operation and design. This is one of the best of those books and not meant to be one that is picked up by the casual ""tinker"" or even an engineer looking for a quick application guide to DC motors. This is a thorough text book on these devices for those who need to engineer for design objectives."

0, Scalpmaster Economy Wash-clothes are not well made.: The first time I washed the wash-clothes a couple of them raveled because the hems were too narrow. Another one raveled in the next washing. I use these every day. I have some that were bought as seconds that have held up for 5 years - better made and thicker. The seconds have finished edges rather than hemmed. I did not expect the clothes to be luxurious
1, Great product: My husband has been using this cream for many years. Just recently we are unable to find this product in our local stores. When I found it online
1, Delicious!: I have been drinking Senseo coffee for a couple of years now
0, Ever have car dealer waiting room coffee?: I am completely disappointed in this product. Got the machine at a second hand store to try it out. Let's make it short and say save your money. The senseo pods are stale right out of the package. I have been drinking coffee for a long time and know that it will taste as good as it smells out of the package. SO if you smell dry cereal or grain instead of rich sweet coffee before you brew it
1, Great coffee: Since I have had my Senseo coffee maker

1, iloveshoes: I love this scent. I have worn it for casual events for several years. A great everyday fragrance.
0, Dull: Implausible story involving hawks that can steer ships and wipe tears from the heroine's face. Love story wasn't believable or interesting.
1, Polar bear 12 pack: The polar bear 12 is a great product that does what it advertised. With proper ice packs and starting with cool drinks it will easily keep drinks cold in Wilmington
1, Inspired and enlightened me: The first edition of Starware is a book I've read 3 or 4 times
0, Useless: It took me forever to get the lock to actually open
0, Seam came out after less than 2 months use: At first my husband loved this wallet--it fixed the giant bulging wallet problem for sure. However
0, Worth 1.99 (maybe) not 19.99: This is the cheapest possible piece of nylon (or similar material) sewed into a wallet shape. You would never buy this if you saw it in a store. It is a rip-off at this price. Amazon should be ashamed to carry this item. If you have a sense of humor
0," An utterly useless supplement.: This book follow's Stryer's book parallel and tells you ""Next"
0, Disjointed collection of documents and PK photographs: Considering the author was an officer and probably one of the better soldiers in the SSTK division this book is a huge disapointment. Ullrich's book consists of nothing more than a collection of maps
1, TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING!: I just love this book. I love the artwork on the cover and every word within. What spirited high consciousness! In one breath
1, Really nice quality: Very nice product. Good quality. Wears well. Large enough for good coverage. Other ones like this are usually small and thus cannot be wrapped properly. I HIGHLY recommend.
1, Useful: Very nice piece of headdress
1, In his lovely memory: This is a wonderful product
1, Michael Jackson 25th year Bad Deluxe: One of his best albums. 3 CDs and 1 concert Dvd. I have Thriller and like to have a couple of CDs from a musician so that I have an extended listening set.
1," Bad Michael Jackson: I have the cassette tape of Bad and had decided it was time to purchase the CD. I love listening to music and it so happens this CD is ""BAD."""
1, just excellent!: one of the best in his career!it's gotta be my favourite album.excellent lyrics
0, hello larry ...: ... let's just say: there was better music being made in detroit in the '70s. a little more entertaining
0, CAN OPENER WITH AN ATTITUDE: It took two adults with college and medical degrees several times to figure out the proper positioning of the can-cutter blade. The safety edge resealable top is a nice feature but the edge of the can is sharp and anything but safe. Basicaly a good product
0, House of Orange: I have been seeking a certain book that I read as a child; I thought that this book was it. It was not. That is no one's fault; I went by title alone. My problem was that
0, Is it child-like or childish?: Like many of the readers (and reviewers) I expected a lot more from this book. It's a strange book at best; Gooch seems to be tied up with his very own boyfriend: Brad Gooch
0, Do I have to give it even one?: Brad Gooch writes with stunning clarity about how beautiful he thinks he is
0, This is a joke
0, Eh: Is very Deepak Chopra-esque. Almost feels like Mr. Gooch might be a closet schizo and this is his way of legitimizing a pathology....
0, What A Shame: I picked Lars and the Real Girl up from the library thinking it was going to be a nice romantic comedy. It was my wife's birthday and she enjoys movies starring Ryan Gosling.Boy was I mistaken. This is an independent film about a guy who has some quirks... He decides to get a girl friend and chooses a life-sized doll.When he brings her over to meet his family
0, Lars: It was definetly funny but awkward. I watched it with my one of my girlfriends and we would look at each other with shock saying is this really happening!
1, It's cute....: The man (Ryan Gosling) always seems to amaze me. He can play just about any character. Nice to see people in an entire town come together.
1," A Strange Movie: ""Lars and the Real Girl"" was an offbeat"
0, Defective Unable to use: Parts would not fit together. Holes for bolts also would not line up. Very defective. Looked like a manufacturing problem.
1, ablounger: The ab lounge arrived sooner than I expected which was quite nice. Product was as advertised and works as expected. Doesn't fold up as easily as I would like
1, EXERCISE is good
0, Product with no results: I bought this item for my wife after she had our baby. She is a naturally thin girl but gained a sufficient amount of weight during her pregnancy. She has always worked out and began again after having the baby. She lost all of the weight in her legs

GLAD I FINALLY FOUND IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAV MOVIES. SHARON TATE WAS FAB ON THIS MOVIE. I LOVED THE PART WHEN EVERYONE COMES OUT OF THE GRAVES FOR THE BALL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU LOVED OLD TIME MOVIES YOU'LL LOVE THIS. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
1, Potter's best effort yet.: This album is simply awesome. It stayed in my CD player for weeks after I got it. The compositions are very original and stunningly crafted. The playing is pristine
0, Terrible product: This iron will drench your clothes. It doesn't know the difference between steam and flood. Awful. It also will shut off and the on light will blink red. Zero explanation for what this means in any manual anywhere. Do not buy this iron.
0, Don't buy this iron!: I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this iron when my old one died. My old iron was a cheap Sunbeam which lasted for years.This is the worst iron I have ever used. This iron will not get wrinkles out
0, awful!: After busting the one i had

The themes were musically and emotionlly understood and assimilated; the composer painted for us a restful"
1, impact of conversation on growth: As a practicing oncologist I deal with peoples struggles for their life.This is another story about an individual's struggle to take control of their life.In some other reviews of this book I think the readers missed the basic concept. This is not a book that blames parents for their childrens psychological problems
1, A Must Read: This book was absolutely awesome!!! Once I started reading it I could not put it down until it was finished around 3am. This book is definitely a must read for single females
0," song in the preview of captain corelli's mandolin: this is to Mark and Rosie: the name of the song that you are looking for (played in the preview of this movie but not on the soundtrack album) is ""Tonight and the rest of my life"" by Nina Gordon."
1, A wonderful and enchanting cd...: This original score is truly beautiful with soft and lofty melodies that capture your heart and fill it with romance. This is a must-have for anyone who loves scores
0, Mislead Also: I didn't go out and purchase the cd yet but as well as Mark.D.Kim I was looking for the song that comes out during the preview because I am getting married and loved the song when I heard it in the movie threaters and was hoping someone could help me find the song so I could play it at my reception. Thank you Mark because if it wasn't for your review I would have made the same mistake and purchase the cd looking for the same song.
1, nothing compares to Senseo: While I love this coffee
1, Great tasting and very easy to make: It doesn't get much simpler than this. All one has to do is put the pod in the Senseo coffee maker
1, non-delivery: I advised Amazon that I did not receive this package even though the documentation said it was delivered. Amazon said I have to check with my postoffice. My postoffice says I have to file a form
1, super convenient: I still like using the Senseo machine and pods. They are super convenient- allowing for just a cup of coffee when I want it and not having to deal with either cooked coffee that has been sitting on the warming tray too long or cold coffee. I use my in the office. It is in a common kitchen area. Several others staff have their own little mini coffee pots and have to do the measuring of how many cups of water and how many scoops of coffee. I just pop in the pop
1, Great coffee!: Very good coffee. We have gotten rid of our drip coffee maker and only use the senseo. We were always wasting coffee in the drip maker

1, great for the price: but used them once and one of the bits is already starting to round over when I torqued it a bit on my folding knife. For 8 bucks I don't mind buying a few sets for the flexibility but it'd be nice if they were stronger than cardboard
0, Land Before Time: The price was reasonable and I was very excited when the movie arrived early. However
1, Dinosaur Movie - Maybe for Older Kids: I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas
1, wonderful: I have seen this movie many many times now
1, artwork: The striking thing about this animated picture is the paint work. Every detail of this movie is an art itself. I also read a review in which was mentioned that Don Bluth could not match Disney. I just think that the Don Bluth's style is somewhat different then Disney's. In spite of the splendid qualities of the disney movies I prefer to watch Don Bluth's animated movies because they are truely artistic. The colours and warmth are much more intense and the scores are better too. I do not have scores of disney movies but I do have scores of Don Bluth's movies. The 'Secret of Nimh' and 'the Land before time' are unbeatenable. Both the movies and the movie scores are 'must to have'.(By the way

0, The DVD Stinks
0," Special features appropriate for toddlers!: I can live with this dvd being only fullscreen (that is supposedly its OAR) but to call this an Anniversary Edition & provide the worst special features ever on dvd is outrageous. Bluth/Spielberg/Lucas should sue Universal to have there names removed from this atrocity & replaced with Alan Smithee. You know when the first ""special feature"" is ""how to use your remote control"" that this disc was produced for children 1-5 years old. My 7 year old nephews turn their noses up at it. What a great movie. What a HORRID dvd presentation. Do what you like with the 101 sequels but give us a quality dvd of this classic original movie. PLEASE!"

I added a second picture of what the item actually looks like. It should be a little more up close to see the details too. These cost quite a bit at the store. This was a great price on here. I bought from the seller who was the cheapest (they stated the box was rough). Which it was
1, Sweet Mollie Malone: Jumpin Jehosephatz
1, Powerfully Difficult to Swallow: I wanted to put this book down after each paragraph because it was so painfully true and powerful. It was difficult to accept the truth. Mr. Adam's attack on our man made church doctrines was too true for comfort. He is clear about the beast and 666 and the church and Europe. Now I have to rethink my own convictions. This book has had a very big impact on me.
1, One of Book of Love's Best: What I like most about Book of Love is their ability to have fun while also maintaining a serious side and their skillful use of an infectious driving beat. Add to that their brilliance as musical artists who write all their own lyrics and help produce their own albums. Lullaby has several of the most poignant and enchanting love
0, Overrated with a capital O: Sorry
1, Well done album: It's tough for me to say which is a better U2 album
1, This is one of their best CD's: Every song on this album is good. I am a big U2 fan and this is my favorite album.
0, Not so good: This is probably the worst book in the series. There is not much going on. The plot did not advance at all from the previous book and to think I waited two years for this book. The only important part is the prologue which is like the continuation of the Book 9
0, Boring.: What happened with this book? From the 1st book till the 9th it was really good but here there's rarely any action at all. I was expecting better from this series.
0, Crossroads of Twilight: SLOW!.... Slow!.... Slooooooow! Absolutely no action in this installment. Dialogue

0, many wasted hours i'll never get back: This series could have been great. It's worthless drivel at this point. The reasons have been given a thousand times already
0, Very very very slow ...: And very very disappointing. I don't know. In Winter's Heart
0, A whole lot of NOTHING: That's what you'll get. Well

0, God it hurts...: The first 5 or 6 books of this series is great. They are fast
0, crossroads of twilight: Come on Jordan
0, Once again
0, Give us our money back!: This was junk. I have been a devoted Jordan fan since 1995. I've told all my freinds how great the series is and what an exceptional writer Robert Jordan is. I never thought Robert would make me out to be a lier. I just don't get it. Did he forget what a sword and fantasy novel is? How does he publish a book that has no action in it whatsoever? My advice to Jordan is try agian. It has occured to me that he's prolonging this series to get money. And I would hope that no author would go this low to solicite money. If he need $ he could of just asked for donations. That way there wouldn't be extra space in my closet taken up with this poor excuse for a fantasy novel.Some would say that he's just trying to fulfill his vision of a fantasy novel much the same way George Lucas makes Star Wars- for himsef first and the public second. In which case I say fine. Just give us our money back robert! That way we don't feel so cheated.
0, A Quick Analogy: Once I ate a BBQ Pork sandwich
0, 2 years' wait for ... nothing?: One star is being generous.I found the last book moderately entertaining
0, Terribly diappointing: If you're looking for a continuation of the action from the first nine books
0, Don't look
0, Six hundred pages of.....nothing.: Well. I'd say it's about time to give Jordan a round of applause. He has managed to do what few even come close to---write a full length fantasy novel and have -nothing- happen
0, Robert Jordan is a horrible horrible person: Before I read this book I never realized how little a person could say in SO MANY words. Almost 700 pages of NOTHING. We waited how long for this piece of [junk]? If he wants to stop the series he should just stop it
0, Show about nothing = funny. Book about nothing = joke on me: No one moves. there is an amazing artform developing here
0, I waited two years for this?!?: It's official. The magic is gone. There was once a time when I couldn't put down an Eye of the World volume. Now
0, Absolutely Nothing: Nothing happens? Absolutely nothing! 680 pages and the characters do nothing. Oh wait...you do get a bunch of tertiary new characters who do nothing but confuse. Jordan has said on NUMEROUS occasions he knows what the last scene is in this series. I begin to believe he doesn't know how to get there.
0, Shame on RJ: WOT was/is a good series. Now
0, Don't Bother: Since his terrific start in this series Jordan has generally gone downhill with the plot dragging on and on. In volume nine
0, This is the worst one yet: I can't believe that some people claim this book is the the best one yet. This book just proves that Jordan doesn't know how to tell a story.BUILD to a climax
0, Stout wool
0, I have to agree...: I have been the most ardent of fans and unlike most Shadow Rising adherents I feel that the Lord of Chaos is the pinnacle of the series. This book however
0, What a colossal waste ...: of time and money. I have read the first four books many times
0, Absolutely BORING: The reason I became hooked on this series was because of the great characters (Rand
0, The worst yet: This is definately the worst of the series so far. I agree that you could easily skip this book altogether. This book frustrated me to no end in that all storylines carried over from the last book were left unresolved and the only progression is that we now understand the different characters intentions. It is not enough to simply learn a few details while you read 600 some odd pages of dialogue and observations while the plot of the characters I have grown to love did not advance at all. At all! I just cant understand how Robert Jordan could let this go to publish. I have to remind myself when reading this that this is the same guy who wrote Eye of the World
0, Save your money and your time: I'll keep this brief
0, Rand first shows up on page 544: Horrible book. Robert Jordan should be embarrassed. The other reviews state this. I must say it have made me feel better reading them. I am so happy that this got a 1.5 star rating.But I'd like to add that the editors of this book should be embarrassed also. There are multiple transitions in the book that just don't make sense or are confusing because RJ hasn't given enough details on what is going on (because he's too busy describing what each person is wearing).Shame on the publishers for putting this book out and shame on RJ. RJ must have contracted Alzheimers because his books have deteriorated horribly. You suck RJ.
0, Please
0, Just shoot me now. . .: Robert Jordan has accomplished something no other writer has ever done before - turned me off of a series before I finished it. It no longer matters to me if there are 2 more books
0, unfortunate: Mr. Jordan your story has become unfortunate. The Crossroads of Twilight was the worst book that I've ever read and I regret beginning what was once a fascinating story. I will not slog through anymore of your tedious and infinitely repetitive depictions of icy Aes Sedai serenity
0, How to meta game Wheel Of Time Series into a Choose your own adventure: The best way to enjoy this series is to read up to book 4 then stop. In your mind at that point is contained all the magic and cool adventures that could possibly happen to the 3 friends who leave a small village and set off for adventure. If however
0," Worst book of the series: A brief insight into what was going through Jordans head while writing this would be something like ""Blah"
0, What they said...: Yes
0, It's just too bad...: I held off reviewing this because I think the other reviewers to date pretty much have it nailed down. Yes
0, average customer reviews ---- 1.5 stars.(over 1300 reviews!): Possibly achieveing the lowest score on amazon ever
0, This would be funny if it weren't so sad: Note to RJ: You already killed the cow
0, The Series that just won't die ...: This series is going absolutely no where in a hurry. The author has so many minor character story lines still going its ridiculous. What started out as a series that moved ... kept you engaged has turned into a crawl the last several novels.Did he change editors?Read something else ... maybe the rest of the series will quietly die or show up for free at a half-finished unreadable rummage sale by 2025.
0, RJ - please start paying attention to your fans!: Up until a couple of days ago
0, I'm Done: Mr. Jordan has taken character and plot development to a new level...total boredom. I just read in one reader review that he
1, crossroads of twilight: This is one of the best installment in robert jordans series. The prot becomes intricate and more interesting as the series draws closer towards tai'mon Gaidon in which rand al'thor has to fight the dark one in order to save the world. Any who think this a slow book must be pretty boring people who are very hard to please!
0, Time to give up on the series: Too many minor characters to keep track of
0, Doesn't deserve even 1 star!!!: I refuse to buy anymore of Jordan's books until he finishes the series with some decent books with action and more story than describing characters
0, Dull
0, Why is this series so addictive?: It's like the taint on Saidin. You keep turning pages
0, Time to redeem yourself Mr Jordan: I'm afraid that like many readers of The Wheel of Time series
0, Robert Jordan drags out another: It's a shame... once again
0, ARGH=>never pre-order ZERO STARS!!!!!: I made the mistake of pre-ordering this book. Never again
0, Much Ado About nothing: Well I finally ended reading Jordan's 10th torment. I have to say it was not as bad as I thought it might be but sure hell could have skipped a few chapters and get to the good stuff which apparently takes place in the last ..20 pages? Cmon
0, Disappointing: After 2+ years since the last
0, Well
0, Dreadful: It's awful of course. Draggy and very slooowww. One suggestion for those of us who are stuck in the series. Don't read the book in chapter order. Skip around and only read about the characters who interest you. If Elayne bores you to tears and you find a section on her
0, Complete stall in action and hanging on unimportant details: The saddest part is that I have had to defend Mr. Jordan for three books now with the friends I got addicted to the 'Wheel of Time'. Now Mr. Jordan has written one that I cannot defend. Absolutely nothing happens in this book. More unimportant characters are described in lavish detail. The only two items of interest are that both camps of Aes Sedai are entertaining alliances with the Black Tower and Egwene ends up captured by Tower Sisters. Other than that
0, Worst book in series: Dear Tor
0, Long wait. Little worth.: After reading through chapter after chapter of useless detail that failed to progress the plot
0, marketing case study: Crossroads is a miserable book. Just awful. There is no follow up to Rand's supposed cleansing of the source or anything that the series was originally about. Jordan
0, Absolutely Terrible: Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague. When I start a series
0, The thing that sucks the MOST...: Is how much retarded emotional investment has been put into these friggin' characters. Goddamn
0, Zero plot advancement: I concur with the other reviewers. Nothing happens in this book. Save yourself some money and skip from #9 to #11 with the assurance that you're missing nothing. Robert Jordan's editor needs to have words with him.
0, Yadda
0, Nothing Happens!: This book was egarly awaited and is such a let down because there is no furthering of plot or action of any kind! I'm trying to decided if Jordan has a reason for this torment or if he is truly as baffeled as we the readers by the recent events of his series.
0, Worse book I have ever read: I love attention to detail and a complexed book or series. The first 5 books in this series are fantastic. The next 4 were not as good
0, SKIP IT!: While I love the series
0, I hate to be negative but...: I am a WOT fan. I have enjoyed this series
0, When is the story going to progress?: Like many
0, It just keeps getting worse: I give high praise to Robert Jordan for his early books in the Wheel of Time series. Unfortunately his later books keep getting progressively worse.Don't even bother reading Crossroads of Twilight. Nothing happens. It is actually pretty amazing that Jordan can fill so many pages in a book and still not advance the plot.I'm finished reading his books. I might pick them up again if he ever finishes the series but I'm done waiting to the next installment in his saga.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
0, Where is the plot?: Another reviewer summed it up pretty nicely: Robert Jordan must be paid by the word. There's no other explanation for this book. The story simply does not develop from Winter's Heart. The progress of the story could be summed up in one to two rather short sentences
0, As usual
0, 795 pages of filler: I understand that when writing a series there is some pressure from the publisher to get the next one out.I have read literally hundreds of fantasy novels and this rates as the worst one to date. I love the Wheel of time series but have never read a book that spent so much time describing the minuture of meaningless detail that fills at least half of the pages of this book.If you are looking for anything about the central character Rand then expect to see about four pages worth. This book could have easily been condensed into two chapters and filled out with a lot more interesting writing. You could skip this book and probably not notice it when book eleven comes out.
0, Modern Novel Marketing 101: First off
0," ROBOT Jordan vs. The Sims: After reading this lackluster installment of what was once my favorite fantasy series. I think that the rumours are true about the author's self destructive life style. He has obviously lost a large number of neural pathways and has burned out his brain.This book was written by ROBOT Jordan. He is obviously on cruise control and living in some kind of artificial simulated reality where writing is a program and text is reproduced according to alogrithm. I think TOR needs to step in and have a real live author help pull his strings for him.. Kind of like what Geppeto did for Pinnochio. Better yet bring in a faith healer or an exorcist. All I know is that Jordan is going to need some major mojo or voodoo to re-animate his ""cold dead hands""....Hopefully it will happen soon or else all we'll be left with is a pile of dust and a test pattern...."
0, Thank goodness for libraries: (with apologies to Winston Churchill)Never in the history of Fantasy novels have so few (Jordan)
0, I'm Convinced--the series now stinks: Yes
0, From Fantasy to Soap Opera Writer: Well
0, As slow as it gets: This has to have been one of my favorite series of all time. I couldn't wait for this one to be to show up at more door! How disapointing. Now the Wheel of Time series is a deep story wih lots of detail
0, No action. No progress. Very disappointing: I have eagerly anticipated the release of this book and the opportunity to touch base with the characters and story line that I have been hooked on for years in the hopes that Mr. Jordan would take us back to the heart of the main story and get away from the trends of his recent volumes. However
0, If you haven't read it yet
0, An Interesting Question: I began reading the Wheel of Time about two years ago. I read straight from the beginning to the end in about two months and loved just about every minute of it. Granted there were parts in the later books that I spaced out through a bit and some of the Nynaeve/Elayne chapters could grate on my nerves
0, What an waste!: If you liked the Books 7
0," Please move the story along.: I have been following ""The Wheel of Time"" series over the years. I have really enjoyed the series until the last few books"
0, Don't buy the hardcover: Wait until all the books are out before you buy this one. He's milking it for all he's worth at this point.
0, I've been robbed!: What a bitter disappointment. This series started out so incredibly great and has become so very dreary. Someone else mentioned that we have been waiting for the battle for the White Tower since book 6!! GET TO THE POINT ALREADY!I can appreciate plot development and pulling all the sub-plots together but at least make it entertaining. It took me weeks to read this one because it kept putting me to SLEEP!I'm done with WOT. On a separate note Amazon.com should change the ratings so you can give zero stars.
0, Major Diappointment: I have read all of the books in this series and have found the last two to be major disappointments when compared to the first 2 or 3. As one reviewer mentioned
0, If I Could Give Negative Stars...: Any movement

0," Flash!!! TOR editors piece together WOT 10 from scraps: Two years is a long time to wait to see how much embroidery and lace Matt has come to like on his clothes. ""Glacial"" as one review suggests isn't even the word for the pace of the last two books. When RJ (or whoever) actually does advance any story line he does it in less than a paragraph"

0, Support your local library: Save your money and get this from a library. Mr Jordan has milked this tale long enough. It's a pity he does not respect the readers enough to end it. Prequel? Nah
0, Wretched: I feel unclean.I forced myself to finish this book just in case I might have found an enjoyable chapter somewhere inside it. Sadly
0, Review of reviews: I once loved Wheel of Time. But around book 6 or 7
0, ...: The biggest disappointment in WOT series. If you have not read it
0, Sub par: 700 pages
0, Snore...: This is a book that could have been sumated in the prologue/introduction. It really does move slow
0, Jordan should have stopped with #7: Jordan has again diverged from the main characters. Mat and Perrin have some time but Rand is nearly non-existant. Prolonging the story
0, But nothing happens!: I do not doubt that Robert Jordan is an excellent story-teller
0, Extremely Disappointing: I thought that maybe Jordan had revived himself after he actually had some interesting plot lines in Book Nine. However
0, Massive Dissapointment: This was in my opinion the worst book of the series. The book felt long while reading it and overall nothing really occurred to give any direction to the plot
0, Where's the Dragon?: I must like to suffer
0, I waited for this???: There is an old saying
0, Don't waste your time with this one: This book has got to be the worst of the series to date. Not only does the plot go nowhere
0, Tedious: No matter how quickly or how slowly Jordan wraps up this series
0, The Worst Book Ever Writt.en: Garbage! This book should be used for kindling only. Your entertainment dollars would be put to better use purchasing a book describing mildew growing on bathroom tiles. I believe the pretentious Mr. Jordan has begun to think of himself in terms of Mellville
0, Wake-up and Smell the Coffee: Anybody who buys this book must be masochistic. The last book was a joke on the faithful readers who invested much time and money on this series(i.e. 200 pages on Egwene getting the Nobles permission to travel w/ her army--what a bore!). That was enough to convince me that Jordan has lost touch with reality.
0, Very let down: I agree that this series has become very drawn out with the last couple of books and this book has just made it alot worse.It's amazing the amount of irrelevant details that this book contains. the only detail that I can think of that Robert Jordan missed out is how long Matts hair nose has grown from page to page.
0, 4 chapters stretched out to 600+ pages: WoT
0, Painful: This book was truly a waste of time.. Very little happens to progress the story
0, Outsmart the GREEDY BAS_ _ _ _: It's plain and simple. Jordan is just too lazy to take the time to write a good ending to the series. He's also a huge sell-out and a GREEDY B (I mean
0, Ready to give up on Mr. Jordan: I am ready to give up on Mr. Jordan and this series. The first 6 or so books in this series only took me about 3 nights each to read
1, I liked it: Why do you all waste your time if you do not like Jordan and why wasting my time to read your stupid reviews? Jordan's creating a world on its own and things in it don't allways develop like in action movies. More action
0, Shame on you Jordan for sqandering our trust on this...: ... horrible WASTE of time!What a huge collection of hot-aired babble! It is 800 pages of virtually nothing. The plot of the story went almost no where and could be summerized if even needed in a couple of chapters. Bla-Bla-bla Drama! Do not waste your money! Do not waste your time!
0, Awful beyond words: Jordan's continued slide into the abyss of worthlessness continues unabated. While most of his books contain hundreds of pages of filler
0, So disappointed: Jordan could have wrapped this entire book up in 10 chapters or 140 pages and given everyone almost as much enjoyment to the reader
0, I AM DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: As the title says I AM DONE! Reading Jordan's books that is. It took me three weeks to finally finish this incredibly boring edition in the WoT series. There were over 800 pages of absolutely nothing. Nothing but paragraph long sentences that you had to read three times to figure out that they didn't say anything. Robert Jordan
0, Not again!: I've actually come full circle with this book:I borrowed book 1 from a friend
0, The local library...: I urge you not to buy this book. It seems RJ has decided to prolong WOT indefinantly. I found myself skimming most of this episode
0, I give up: I've been following this series for years and was vastly disappointed with the last few. *This* one however
0, Worst in the series
0, this was junk: RJ was never much of a writer to start with
0," There's a problem with this novel people are not addressing.: I see a lot of the people who liked this book saying ""Guys stop complaining"
0, Holy sucky soap operas Batman!: I just finished Jordan's latest installment and I must say
1, One of the best books for all the dog people: This story reminds us that dogs are the best companions for human-beings. The firm and genuine friendship between Nero and Patrache is clearly described against the background of the dark
1, Take a Trip!: A real nice job of puting together the music on this CD.one of the best covers of Route 66 by any band is on this CD
0, Disliked it I'm afraid: I am SHOCKED at how many loved this book! I hate to put negative comments on Amazon...but I don't think I could have slept tonight if I didn't comment on this one. I thoroughly disliked this book I'm afraid. I really struggled trying to even finish it. It had HORRIBLE language btw. Luckily my sister had edited for me before she loaned it to me. I really would not recommend this to anyone. Sorry:(...like I said I hate to be negative
0, no multi lane sata cables included: Would love to try this card out since I just ordered it however it doesn't come with the necessary mini sas -> x4 sata multilane 3ware breakout cable. Something to be aware of if you order this. Amazon sells the cable for about 18$.It would be nice if there was some indication that this was an OEM barebone card in the description.I'll update the review once the card is up and running.
0, Highly disappointed: Dickies Men's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket
1, Underneath Everything Else Lies An Optimism About The Future Of The Human Species: This work from the greatest writer of science fiction's golden age contains legendary stories end to end. Set on the earth of the past
0, Illustrated Man review: The Illustrated Man was not a interesting book to read. It never appealed to me. Maybe I am biased because I never liked science-fiction
0, ZzZzZ...: I don't mean to offend Ray Bradbury
1, Best required reading I ever done: This book is fabulous! Never since my early childhood did a book influence my life. I enjoyed the wide variety of main characters
1," Illustrated Man: ""Listen"
1, For love of evil: I absolutly loved this book.; Piers ASnthony incorperated all of his other novels so they interwind together [pure genius!] The book itself is A class and if you read the other stories you can gasp at the recognition. The events are the same only from different perspectives. I thought this to be quite appealing considering that Piers Anthony is the best writer that ever breathed. I demand that you read this book!
1, Loving Evil: This is one of the best books in the universe. It explains for how the immortal Satan was in life
0, Cute
1, MAN LIKE ME....THE BEST!!!: I AM A LOYAL COUNTRY MUSIC FAN...AND I LIKE IT ALL. BUT HERE LATELY I'VE BOUGHT PROBABLY 6 OR 7 CDS...AND MAN LIKE ME HAS SUPPASSED EVERY ONE OF THEM!!! BOBBY IS PURE COUNTRY AND THE LYRICS ARE BREATHTAKING!!!! THIS IS ONE CD I ACTUALLY LOVE...AND CHERISH EACH SONG!!!
1, A New Voice: This album is a breath of fresh air
1, An excellent first from this newcomer!: These days I find that I cannot stand the newer artists that are hitting Nashville
0," Misleading Product Information: Please be aware that this is not as currently** described in the Product Description:""Pack of ten best-selling Bookworms ideal for building up class libraries. Each Pack contains one copy of each listed title. * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer * The Elephant Man * A Little Princess * Love or Money? * The Monkey's Paw * The Phantom of the Opera * The President's Murderer * Sherlock Holmes and the Duke's Son * White Death * The Wizard of Oz ""Those above two sentences led me to believe that I would receive exactly that -- 10 books"
0, Very disappointing: I was looking forward to a verbal journey. A talk with musicians and poets
1, in a word...: Fantastic.Beautiful
0, Sub-par: It's only a testament to how good a director Ron Howard is that I write to express my disappointment in this really slow-moving film.It just never really seems to come together on any level. Howard's films are traditionally extremely character driven and I was shocked when that seemed to be the movie's main failing. What drove Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones's characters were just never really explored. It wasn't for lack of time either
1, Good to see Once...I think: If you are considering seeing this movie
1, Great movie: I have watched this movie numerous times and now I have it in my collection and I can watch it any time I want to. Thanks for a great movie.
1, Hurricane Bay by Heather Graham: I can't get enough of Heather Graham books. This one was alittle more romance less ghosts. Still it was enjoyable read. She has a way with her charcters that make you want to like them . The Kelsey/Dane romance was written well
0, Crackling noise: I received this product in good shape. However
0, Provence: Very disappointing.... The photographs are not great and did not give me a feel for the region. At least not in the way it has been described to me. This book does not live up to its name. It does not make me want to visit Provence.
1, Tie before you fly.: This handy book provides a detailed instructions for tying a wide variety of flies that will be useful when flyfishing in Alaska. The book is organized into chapters devoted to a particular type of fishing (i.e.
0, Hard to get cans started: Poorly engineered can opener.It is VERY difficult to get a can started. If you keep trying
0, WORST CAN OPENER EVER!!!: This can opener took forever to install and now that it is installed doesn't work well AT ALL. if it actually decides it's going to hold a can it drops it as soon as its done opening it. I will be staying away from the Black and Decker brand from here on out!
0, Impossible to mount: Impossible to mount under a normal cabinet. May be possible in Chinawith their cabinets
0, Black & Decker under counter can opener: This thing is gutless. It will barely
0, You Get What You Pay For: They changed the hole pattern(more holes). They went to a knife edge (this makes a jagged edge) so it makes it harder to pierce some cans.You will find a lot of slop in the handle. You get spacers to lower the opener. I used the two wide spacers
1, best ever: This book is an amazing book! It goes through the life of high end riders doing the big eq. It shows different lives each riders have and what they have to give up to do their dream. THe book is very well developed and it is an amazing book
1, Best book ever: This book is amazing. Our newborn baby (3 weeks old) was crying and crying at night. We couldn't get her to stop. I plopped on the bed and started reading this book and boy oh boy did the techniques made her stop crying; it was amazing.It is also very helpful because they teach you how to swaddle and then how to wean the baby off the swaddle when they are ready. The best book ever!
1, Great Info
1, A well-written practical book: The book gives a complete review of diseases and vaccines so the reader can make an educated and informed decision of each vaccine for their child. . You will appreciate it on many levels. This book is a must for any new parents. The information is a life safer for your kidsWhen you have babies you can't go without these titles:The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts about VaccinationThe Vaccination Myth: Courageous MD exposes the Vaccination Fraud!Vaccination Horror: An anthology of important works on vaccination pseudoscienceVaccination: Spreading Leprosy and DeathVaccination: State sponsored Murder
1, Book vs. DVD: I've seen this method in action and it seems to work
1, poorly written but right on the money: it's a god send. Try every counter-intuitive advice inside and you will that it works.But unlike this review
0, Just OK: This book contains a lot of filler...things like background stories that really don't have anything to do with solutions for a crying baby. Luckily
0, Not for older babies: I was disappointed to find that the entire book is for newborn babies only. Once your baby is too old to swaddle this book isn't for you. I purchased several others at the same time and found that The No Cry Sleep Solution has great ideas for all babies and even toddlers. The ideas in the happiest baby book cannot be applied to a baby that is over about 3 months old. If you look at the main points you'll see they are: swaddling
1, Fabulous resource for parents of newborns: Why hasn't anyone else thought to explain the basics of baby soothing to new parents? This book simply outlines the time-honored techniques of swaddling
0, There are much better books on the subject: Dr. Karp's book wasn't very helpful for us
0, Too much fluff: There is some solid advice in this book however it could have been written in a pamphlet. The author uses way too many words and too many examples to prove his point. He makes you read through way too much history to get to the good useful points.
1," Overall A Good Book: Good book overall--has a lot of useless info in it and could be cut down to a smaller size with just the ""pointers"" for parents. Basically"
1, Great Book: All new mothers should read this book. Lots of very useful information for them. No more fussy babies!!
1, Good for night sleeping: I heard about the 5 S's through the hospital classes and even received a swaddling blanket from the hospital when we left after giving birth
1, Creating order out of chaos: As a first time mother with a colicky newborn I felt my life had descended into chaos. Dr. Karp's book helped instill a sense of order and calm for both my son and me. The Happiest Baby on the Block philosophy and strategies make intuitive sense and
1, This works - do the five S's.: A family member gave us this book when we had our baby and it was a huge help. Buy a Swaddle Me or learn to swaddle wrap your baby tightly in a blanket
1, what a lifesaver!: I have had 3 babies
1, Best Baby On The Block: I bought this book for my daughter while she was expecting her first baby. I read the book before I gave it to her
1, Extremely good book: A very good book that looks at the ordinary lives of farmers' farm laborers and rural craftsmen in Victorian England. Very well researched.And written in a a very readable way
1, Real suspense
0," Overrated borefest now: ""Bound"" might've been hot stuff back in 1996"
1, Too good for the price: Had pretty much decided to go with Nuvi 350
0, Product died after one year: This product was mediocre. Unfortunately it died just over one year of use. When it was working
1, I love the security the C220 provides: I've had my Mio C220 for about a week now and have found it to be very reliable. I've been using it to get around town to places I go to all the time. Some times it routes me differently than I would normally have gone but then I change the way it routes (from quickest to shortest...) and it will generally come up with my regular route.It really came in handy last night to get to a party down in the city where I wasn't use to driving. It's not normally the safest part of town at night but I felt very secure knowing how to get there. And when everyone wanted to continue the party at a local bar it was great to be able to hit that home button afterwards and find my way home without a worry of getting lost.If you are wanting to buy a reliable GPS and aren't just looking for a toy with Mp3 and Picture viewer or all the other wastes of memories
0, Don't buy this GPS: Do not waste your money on this GPS. It has a lot of features but you can't get the basic naviagtor to work. The screen is also to small. It seems to lose its signal every time I move it from the cradel.The power supply for the battery must last only 30 minutes with out the power cord.
0, Old map data: The unit is nice and a great value however the map data is so old you will often not find your destination
0, Support/Warranty Horrible: Mio C220 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorGot the system for holiday present
0, Nice hardware
0, BUYER BEWARE: Bad product
1, Better than most: These cable chains offer maximum clearance between the cables and the car body. They are easier to install than others I've used because you don't have to drive over them. I would have given them 5 stars but there is still the same old hassle of getting enough slack in the chains to fasten that last connector.
0, Awful - No Traction: Simply Awful !!! Didnt seem to provide any more traction than a regular tire
0, good idea poorly executed: No way to install these
0, WRONG SIZE!!!: The fitment guide is completely wrong compared to what the packaging for the chains said. I ordered SZ131 for my BMW 330ci tires 245/40/17 per the chart but they are too small... Very frustrated and annoyed that this company does not have their labels and charts correct.
1, Do NOT buy this for 2010 Mazda6: The chain is very easy to install with bare hands
0, Amazon's sizing guide is wrong: My tire size is 225/65-17. Amazon's size guide says to order SZ135. These chains are too small. Another vendor has an online size guide that says SZ143
0, would not recommend for Prius: It slips if there is not enough snow on the ground. Need a few inches of snow to grip properly. Would NOT recommend for Prius drivers!
1," Liza dodging bullets!!!: When I realized this was an action movie I said to myself ""I have to see this"" Liza Minelli as Della Roberts dodging bullets and taking a stabbing (not to mention shooting a gun) was something else"
0, Some Songs Are OK: The fans who say this is TM's best album are going way too easy on him. I think they're so devoted to him that they'd buy a CD of him singing the phonebook. About half the songs are OK
0, What have you people done with the Tim I remember?: I have always been a big fan of Mr. McGraw
0, Really Depressing Album: I am a huge Tim McGraw fan and think he is fabulous in concert. I loved his other albums
0, Tug McGraw's Son STIKES OUT!!: This CD was such a waste of money. I wish I'd heard it before I purchased it. Only the title track was good...what a waste!Tim seems to have lost his Midas Touch. He needs to start writing more of his own music and stop relying on others to pass along his message!BORING
0, Go Back to Country Songs: I heard this album at a friends house
0, I guess you can't hit home runs all the time.: Tim's new album is....just bad. As a fan who has most of his previous albums I can say that this album is a real strike out compared to the solid albums he usually delivers. Except for the title track
0, Save your money
0, Not Stainless Steel: These pliers are not stainless steel. They came packed/coated with a yellowish oil
1, Great smelling stuff!: A wonderful woodsy
0, Disappointing After 50 pages!: I actually never finished this one. Came recommended to me by a tug boat captain who started it while waiting for a dredge to fill up his hopper barge. I know how boring it can be steaming to and from the dumping grounds
1," Great Intellectual: Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the ""noble"" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original"
0, Alexis de Tocqueville's Nemesis: 'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision. An individual who owes everything to the state cannot conceivably be called an 'individual.' They are
0, Dissatisfied: I was very dissatisfied with this product. I was supposed to receive a 2-Disc set as it specifically states on the cover. I received only one disc
0, The day when Mystery dyed: The day when Mystery dyed was the day when mystery turned Politically Correct. How sad. Somehow I hoped
1, Another Winner: Two young girls are kidnapped and shortly returned home with no harm save to their dignity. Then a toddler is kidnapped and the case takes a more serious turn.Inspector Wexford and his team interview the family and discover vexing questions.Learning a pedophile has recently been released from prison and is living in their midst
0, Was the situation corrected?: I wanted to buy this item (since the 2.4MHZ item of the same kind did not work at my place due to all the interferences) but the previus review stopped me. I wonder if the previous reviewer's situation was corrected by amazon.com in that they sent the right item. I could not find the direct email of the previous reviewer to ask directly.
0, unreliable piece of.....: I bought this a couple years ago
0, be careful: Seemed like an easy solution to my problem
1, It actually works pretty well.: These kinds of devices can sometimes be questionable. I was pleasantly surprised that it actually works pretty well. Once the aiming of the antennas is complete
0, do not buy...: i tried it and gave up. The picture quality is very bad. cant go thought 3 walls... I used it for 1 time. don't waste your money
0, Great if I only need 2 minutes of TV: When hooking this product up to my DISH network 311 receiver it only worked for 2 minutes
0, Disappointing: Considering all of the positive reviews
1, Couldn't be better: I ordered this not really expecting to work as well as it does.The receiver is one floor above the transmitter
1, just the right fit: The replacement pneumatic wheel is just the right size
1, Works Great: The Ridgid dado insert works very well .Went into place in about 5 min 
1, Classic!: Every child should know Good Night Moon by heart and what could be better than to hold the bunny while it is being read to you.
1, Too large: The contents was as expected. The size is much too large. If you mentioned the size
1, An every night ritual for 2 1/2 years!: My daughter has always loved to be read to. She preferred this book from day one! As we have read it so many times
1, brilliant bedtime book for two year old: I cant believe what an instant hit this book has been. Our two year old has a collection of 20 or so books
0, Why all the great reviews?: I bought this for my baby thinking it was a great book since it received so many raving reviews. I was so disappointed when I received it. The artwork is horrible
1, bed time read: This is a good book for a bedtime read. A book a child will want to hear over and over. They will one day read it to you.
1, LOVE
0, Weak Character Development and Plot: Goodnight Moon? Ha! What a joke. Margaret Wise doesn't seem too wise to me
1, A must have!: Every child on earth should own a copy of this book. It has been a favorite for all three of my sons. It's a classic that is probably the best known among the first books for children. It's a perfect gift for anyone you know having a baby.
1, Going on copy number 2: We love this book. My son adores it. After bath time
1, Goodnight Moon w/Bunny: If you are familiar with the book
1, Great book going to a 2nd Generation parent for their little one!: Great book going to a 2nd Generation parent for their little one! This book was a favorite when our sons were little
1, A Book For All Time: Can't wait til my grandson is a little older so I can read this book to him. Actually I read it to him now but I think he'll get more out of it as time goes by. It's the perfect book in its' simplicity. The words flow in a natural bed-time kind of rhythm and it conjurs up those kinds of images that make you remember what being a child was all about.The pictures in the book are very nice too
1, Great Book!: My husband reads this book to our 4-month-old son every night after he gets home from work. They both love it and I enjoy listening to him read this to our son. I have it memorized and I've hardly ever read it to our son. It's wonderful. I like the way it changes between black and white pages and color.
0," It'll put you to sleep alright!: My daughter never liked this book. My husband nor I ever cared for it either. It didn't keep our daughter's attention at all nor did it ""soothe"". It just didn't live up to all the hype. We read to our daughter all the time and have since her birth and she loves almost all books"
1, Almost--but not quite--perfect kidlit.: Margaret Wise Brown
1, Very
0, Amazed this book got so many good reviews: My daughter and I were not impressed with this book. The grey pages were boring and the figures too small. Saying goodnight to everything in the room can be done quite easily without this book.
0, What is this book's appeal?: I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again
0, Does not work With A2 clippers:: I bought this adapter kit to use withOster 078005-314 Turbo A5 2-Speed Clipper.This kit simply does not work - clippers on their own work great
0," This product doesn't work with the GroomMaster: This product should not be advertized to buy with the Groom Master Clipper by Oster. although it says these comb guides are ""universal"" they aren't! They don't even come close to fitting on the extra wide cutting head of the Groom Master! DO NOT buy them for the GM!"
0, DON'T BUY!: DON'T BUY! This product is a total waste of money. I had read the reviews and just thought maybe since I was shaving a little Pomeranian and not a larger dog that maybe I wouldn't be as rough on them. WRONG! The other reviews read right! The clippers would not cut using the attatchments and I tried them all. NONE WORKED! Also
1, Mo' better music: Flic has appeared on cable in a cycle lately and I became interested in the music expecially the title track - the musicians are excellent
0, NOT RATED: I wanted the basis for the movie Stanley & Iris which Union Street is but it isn't the screenplay or anything close. So I have no rating. I'll donate the book to the library.
1, Worth the time and money: It is true that this work is not among Shakespeare's greatest by any stretch of the imagination. This entire play reflects the immaturity of a young William Shakespeare. What makes the play so interesting however
1, An introduction to medieval and renaissance literature: For those interested in studying medieval and renaissance literature
1, Pretty Good: This book is good. It does provide the basic and some detailed information you need to make an informed decision regarding a product but one thing I was dissatisfied with was that regarding shea butter she may have been afraid to comment whether good or bad because of the popularity of this particular ingredient. She didn't say whether it was toxic or nontoxic; irritating or nonirritating or maybe she doesn't have enough information about it. I'm more interested in natural ingredients so I want more details concerning it.
0, Chili Pepper Encyclopedia: If I had realized there were no colored photos in this book
1, Great for little kids!: My 2 1/2 year old loves these books. She has about worn them out.Good illustrations and story messages that are all boiled down to something they can understand.
1, Good Book.....hopefully
1, An Interesting Premise ...: ... but the way the story unfolds after the divergence from the historical decision is a little too obvious. Anyone with a knowledge of the historic three-day battle at Gettysburg will immediately notice the parallels with Pickett's Charge. While overall an entertaining novel
0," Untrue Tale: This book might be fine just for reading by someone with no clue to history. To use Gettysburg for a title is such a misleading and for anyone(Dennis Showalter) to use Killer Angels as a comparison is such a misleading statement. There is NO Alternative History and NO ""Quite Differently"" as to what happened at Gettysburg.A book of pure fantasy."
1, A very realistic book about a different Gettysburg...: Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen get together to write a very realistic Civil War novel about what would have happened if Robert E. Lee decided to carry out a sweeping
0, too technical: I found this to be too full of military jargon
1, Gettysburg/Grant Comes East/Never Call Retreat: Well into the third book in the series. Makes me feel like I was there
0, Where was the editor?: Apparently the authors believe that if General Lee had been of a single minded purpose heading into the Battle of Gettysburg
0, Not an Historical Novel: This book was written very well
1, About Time
1, Designer Self Help: Great little pick-me-up book. Bright
0, 1 Hour was not Enough: So many plotholes I dare not go into them here. This being 1 hour in length there were so many scenes that raised questions which were never answered. While Corbin Bernson stole the scenes by nailing down his seedy lawyer character in the first half hour
0, not practical: It looks fine
0, Too much product
0, *NOT* Mac Compatible: In spite of a product description that says the contrary
0, WATCH OUT!!! BEWARE!!!: This device was a major bust!!! Will NOT properly transfer any format data
1, Wonderful Documentary: This is a very insightfull documentary that details all the parties involved in the trade of The Great One to the L.A. Kings. I highly recommend this to anyone
1, Great Program!: I'm glad Sea Hunters went on the search for the SS Carpathia. It's true that most of the world forgot about the little ship that saved the Titanic survivors that night back in 1912. Here
0, Tired of repairing them: After 7 years of re-adjusting
1, Mel Bay American Fiddle volume 2: This is a good instructional dvd for beginners and intermediate players. The instructor goes slow
0, My energy frequency didn't vibrate with this Atmic triad: I truly believe the author's motives were sincere. He makes a good point here and there - though those points and discussions are far from original. What IS original is that FAR too much of this book is California-Zen-Atlantian-energy-infusing-chhakra-modality-crunchy-nut-granola non-sence. Unless you're
0, Favorite ALICE
0, incredibly bad: I am in a quandry. I don't know which is worse - the bad transfer from a poor film or the so-called music. Both suck. The transfer is from a bad copy of a bad quality film. The music is so insipid I can barely call it music. The people who rated this more than 2 stars must have been smoking
1, this is my second pair: My dog chewed up my first pair
1, Cute movie: Cute movie for the kids. Encourages them to move and dance. I think all of the Curious Buddies movies are great!!!
1, It's funny! dont listen to the negatives: This movie wasn't made to be serious or realistic
1, I watched it 3 times in one day.: I notice how this movie didn't get rated with 5 stars. Maybe because Owen Wilson is always funny with ben stiller by his side. But I gotta say he pulled it off without B.Stiller. Not all can relate to this movie. I know I wish I had someone to fend off the bullies while I was in school. LOL!well
1, I have no idea why...: I don't know why I liked this movie. It was stupid
1, funny: this movie is cute and i am very impressed with it and with the product its self... its funny and cute but for a younger audiance if you ask me...
0, Too much cussing by the young kids.: Funny show that really had no need for the all the cussing. There is enough derogatory speech in real life and is not needed to make a show more entertaining.
0, AVOID This movie: Despite I am a big fan of Mr. Owen Wilson
0, A complete and utter waste of time....: One of my friends really likes Ani DiFranco and recommended I listen to her. I bought this CD thinking it would be a good introduction to her music. What a complete waste of time listening to this CD was. I feel like I just had an hour of my life sucked into a bottomless pit from which I can never retrieve it. This pitiful excuse is for an album better be the worst of Ani's music otherwise she is certainly a pitiful excuse for a musician. Truly
1," Hellboy Review: One of the two best movies ever made to star the red guy.Hellboy having an animated film as magnificent and it could only be better if more were made.The art of Sean ""Cheeks"" Galloway does a great job paying a homage to the work of Mike Migonla.I believe people who are fans of Hellboy will really enjoy this film."
1, Marian Visitations: This subject has always fascinated me
0, Oih.: I was forced into reading this book by my Language Arts teacher
0, Umm.... really.: I'm going to be incredibly blunt
1, Great docoration: This unique lamp is very docorative and I have received some good complements. I would recommend buying one.
1, AWESOME!!!: I searched the web for months trying to find the perfect lamp for my bedroom. I finally found this lamp and couldn't believe the price. It was exceptional. I LOVE this lamp and the price. It is gorgeous!!!
1, a real page turner: Unlike most people
1, The Best I've Used: I have used Wright's book over the years and have found it to be the most thorough approach to training Christian's to counsel. He offers so many ways to instill such great truths into the believer so that he or she can pass it on in counseling ministry. Those I have taught from this manual have become very balanced counselors who I now use in my church. I can't say enough about this book...Just buy it and you will not be disappointed!Dr. Darlene Young
0, Hated it: My son got this for Chritmas
1," Great songs!: ""Personal Jesus"" is a great song"
1, A Must have!!!!: This is a must have for anyone who has ever read the vampire chronicles! It digs deep to find the meaning of the chronicles plus
0, Junk: This product would be great - if it worked.I bought this product and it worked great... as advertised... I loved it. Audio
0, Subject to interferences: I had a 2.4 Ghz wireless set but it has a lot of interferences from the microwave oven so I decided to buy this one.When we talk about microwave oven interference
1," What a great seller!: Thank god we finally have vendors and sellers who are taking the embarassment out of buying something that we should all be buying. I just wanted to thank \""Kevin\"" for answering my query so quickly. Not only did he have a wonderful sense of humor"
0, too much static: This item quickly retracted the telephone cord
1, Wonderful classic children's book: We love McCloskey's books and this is no exception. Wonderful story and illustrations. We enjoy reading the book and my child enjoys hearing the story over and over. Definitely a keeper!
1," Just like OEM: Don't let the word ""remanufactured"" fool you. Came in after 2 days. All necessary o-rings were included. Installed the injector. Fired up the engine and presto!... Just like new again. Good quality"
0, The Reign of Terror Had Never Been So Dull: Theres little need to give a synopsis of the story
0, I absolutely hated it: It's actually the worst movie I've seen in my whole life. I'm a great film lover -the kind of person who can't afford to miss a movie whether European
0, I would not recommend this to anyone.: I personally did not favor this text. It was not very interesting and the man needs help in writing books
1, Works as good as the battery that came with the camera: This battery seems to perform the same as the official Cannon battery that came with the camera. recharged it several times and it's great. Length of battery usage is the same
0, Bummer: I purchased this battery for my Cannon Powershot SD770IS. It was to big and would not fit. Very disapointed!
1, Digipower CN4L Battery: I haven't used it very much
1," Helped me on my journey back to God: ""Why Surrender Is NOT A Four Letter Word"" is a book everyone can enjoy and relate to"
0, VCI EDITION!!!!!: The reason for the low rating is the missing scene referenced by another reviewer. I have seen the scene on a Treeline 50 pack which included this film. The VCI DVD has had restoration work
1, If you like Allende
1," Better than the original: This book inspired me to read the original Zorro novel ""The Curse of Capistrano"" by Johnston McCulley. In my opinion this book is far superior to the original."
0, poor quality: The feet fell off the cutting board within days. Despite religious applications on conditioning oil
1, well written: Good story
1, I Liked The Wish Giver: Wish Giver is a book about 4 people who each get a wish from a little man. His name is Thaddeous Blinn. The first
1, The Wish Giver: In Coven Tree they often have these fairs. Sometimes people out of town come to sell things. One of those people
0, Boring Band: A few months ago I went to a Tantric concert in Louisville
0, Currently in Trash Can: This part arrived quickly from the seller but was unusable. There were visible manufacturing defects in both inputs (female 3.5 stereo jacks) and despite this I attempted to insert male audio jacks to no avail. I tried 2 different jacks and even with significant force was not able insert the male ends more than a third of the way in (not even close to making the necessary contacts to function). It is now in the trash can.
1, Worked for what I needed it to: Ordered this to make my XBOX 360 a little more portable.Was shipped fast and worked exactly for what I needed it for
0, Poor Connections: The build quality of this coupler is poor. The internal connectors don't firmly grip the plug when inserted
1, good: Cheap
0, Utterly useless: This double feature editon of both Mortal Kombat films has full screen transfers only. A waste of money.
1, Good Rock: This album by Isle of Q can be described simply as straight up rock. I even think I heard some quitar solos. Good lyrics and good music
0," I just didn't get it: This movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch. I don't like that; going back and forth and not knowing what they ""want"" from me. And I REALLY didn't 'get' the ending. I didn't buy the romance. The only thing I enjoyed about this whole movie was Kevin Spacey; that's it. Just skip through the rest of the crap."
0," HEY LION'S GATE MARKETING DEPARTMENT: ""YOU LIE!!!"": SWIMMING WITH SHARKS is not ""hysterical"" nor is it ""incredibly funny""(as per the DVD liner notes). Rather it is diabolical stealth horror masquerading under a cloak of pseudo-humor wrapped in veiled misogyny. Approached from this vantage point"
0, waste of money: I would agree that any play set should include people
1, Sergeant's Vetscription Antimicrobial Skin Cream: Sergeant's Vetscription Antimicrobial Wound Cream is the best remedy I've found for just about any doggie skin problem that I have run across. I've used it for years on multiple dogs and it's never failed me yet. It's creamy
1," Très bien ...: J'aime bien cet CD. Tommy et Chet sont de très bons artistes. Ce CD s'écoute très bien mais je trouve une peu trop ""country"" certaines plages. Un 8 sur 10 quand mme. Bravo!"
1, The young
1, Wonderful. A good mix of styles.: Chet
0, Would purchase again.: The delivery was quick
0, Horrible products: These two trimmers are probably the cheapest pieces of trash I've ever wasted money on. The little trimmer didn't work from arrival and the bikini trimmer died after 2 uses. DON'T waste your money!
1, Makes using a laptop a pleasure.: I use this mouse full time and at first it was hard to get use to the small size but now I have gotten used to it and for the most part like it. Its real advantage for me is that I do not like using the touch pad on my computer and refuse to use it. This mouse takes up such a small amount of space that makes it worth packing.My laptop case has a place for many items and I usually store it in one of the pockets while not in use. It keeps it safe and I always know where to look for it. It also comes with its own storage bag with draw string.My only trouble with this is that the retractable cord sometimes gets all snagged up. Or some times the cord retracts if you pull it just so. But it usually only takes a minute or two to fix but it can be frustrating. The retractable cord feature is nice if you have limited space and don't want the cord to get tangled with everyhting. I'd give it 4 and a half star rating.
1, Good Overall Study: This book is a very good overall study of the philosophy of Jeffersonian John Taylor of Caroline. The author gives a great synopsis of Taylor's views on such topics as agrarianism
1, A Kid's Review: This is such a fun book to read! Once I started it
0," Should call this book ""Rachel Hates to Dance"": When I was 12 I LOVED dancing so I got this book to inspire me. I never finished it then and now as I'm reading it to my 9 y.o. daughter I see why. It is mostly about Rachel hating dancing and the best dancers either being a horrid brat or a girl who just doesn't care. I think this book has turned my daughter more off to dancing than anything. I also find myself just hating Aunt Cora and wincing at everything she says. I only give this 2 stars because it is a compelling read. It is however NOT an inspiration to dance!!"
0, Poor Quality binding and paper: I bought this book as a gift and have not read it. This was a disappointment as I have bought children's books from Amazon for a number of years and most have been at least adequate. Especially for the price. I didn't gift this book and instead gave a DVD.
1, Donnie McClurkin...Again: In my vast collection of all types of music
1, great at cleaning dishes: Finish Powerball tablets do a wonderful job at cleaning dishes - unlike some of the other tablets or gelpacks out there
1, Good monitor!: I received these monitors as a shower gift and have had them for a year now. I have to say I am very impressed with them! They have the option of wireless (you just need batteries) or plug in. The only bad thing is the base transmitter doesn't have that option. I am impressed with the range too. We went to water our neighbors garden for them and they are 3 houses away but we could still pick up on our son's noises (although with a bit of static interference). All in all
0, DO NOT BUY: These monitors are horrible. I've used them a total of 4 times and can't even get them to work! Static is all we hear. Now we just have to keep checking on our little one if we are downstairs and she's sleeping in her crib! Can't return since we bought them and can't find the receipt. :(
0, Horrible: This item is a joke.First
0, Oh please!: Oh please! These illustrations are AWFUL and the cutsey text and made up names for some of the poses are just dreadful. Do your kids a favor and leave this item in the store. Babar's Yoga For Elephants is a much better bet. If you want your kids to do yoga
1, Where was I when this movie was in A release: I am not sure why this movie is so much fun and it really is. The premise is curious and the sincerity that the actors bring to such broad characterizations almost makes the movie a farce. The actors over act. The color palette is almost too severe. There are extremes of this movie and yet
0," Excellent album from a great band... But the ""ENHANCED"" reissue really sucks!!!: Back in the late 70s"
0, Great if you're already in the cult
1, Greast Bone Classic: This is a wonderful bone album to have thoe I think btnh Resurrection is alot better the tightest songs are 1
1, Other the demonic Mr. Quija 2 skit: This album was great
0, One of my favorites: Bone's E.1999/Eternal: This C.D has classic Bone songs! To me its for people who like to find thier lyrics and try to learn thier style of flowing! This was my first Bone C.D
0, violent: I wish I never bought this CD. The beat is alright
1, definitely the one album every rap fanatic should have: this is the first rap music i listened to about 7 yrs ago..and no doubt why after all these years
1," Dear Boy: ""Ram"" is a curious one-off in McCartney's career"
1, I LOVE this Deluxe Set!: I loved the RAM album in 1971 and I LOVE this Deluxe treatment of it. It was like opening a treasure box
1, So good!: Did not purchase this album when it first came out. So happy to get the CD
1," ""Ram"" is the best solo Beatle album: ""Ram"" is a super rock album. I heard it in a record store a few years back"
1, Guess You Never Knew: Dear Boy: This is in fact a treat for anyone that enjoys the art of mixing. Clean and neat in it's simplicity and just a joy to listen to. Uncle Albert is Abby Road and the White album together. While MY Dog is foot tapping fun that you will sing over and over in your head while Dear Boy Is a symphony of voices that with send rushes to your very soul. A slow Sunday morning deserves to be laced with these sounds.
1, Ram Paul McCartney: the CD was in perfect condition and the purchase met my expectations; I was especially pleased to be able to purchase this CD as I had a hard time finding it elsewhere - thank you!
1, Tension
1, Love it!: This is typical Santana
1, Great Music for the Ages: I've been into Santana from the beginning and have seen him grow with each album. This is another level we are seeing him at right now. He will forever suprise all of us loyal fans. A really great album for the lifelone fan and newly initiated.
1, This CD Rocks!!: I had never heard of Santana before this summer
1, really more than 4 stars: This is an excellent CD. Almost 5 stars. I have listened to it several times in just the first couple of days. Great classic Santana
1, A Great Cd: If you love new music or Santana this CD is the best. The Dave Matthews/Eagle Eye Cherry/Rob Thomas songs are all great. Many take the cake. This is a great cd!
0, We waited years for this crap?: When I heard that there was to be a new Santana album
1," SANTANA-SUPERNATURAL: OUTSTANDING CD! SANTANA WAS ALWAYS A GREAT GROUP-SINCE THE 70'S! CELEBRATE HIS EXPLOSION INTO 2000 WITH A MIXTURE OF FINE LISTENING. SMOOTH IS THE ULTIMATE! If you enjoy this fantastic cd- explore Santana's past ventures with prime hits like ""You've Got to Change Your Evil Ways"" & ""Evil Woman""."
0, i only like one song out of here: you know
0, Supernatural is just pop music not Rock
1, I liked it -from a non-fan: I'm not a big fan but I really did enjoy this album. For me it's got some really well put-together tunes and was a great stress-reliever to listen to. Good car driving tunes too.
0, GARBAGE: One word says it all and I sure dont mean the group with that name. This is a great album for the teeny boppers
1, I thought that this album was excellent!: As any great musician evolves over time
0, Over Rated!: Love of my Life
1, If you weren't a Santana fan before
1, It already rocks.: I haven't even bought the CD from Amazon yet but the song Love of my Life rules! Go Dave!
1, What A Great Album!: Carlos Santana is back
0, No Black Magic Here.: Have always thought of Santana as one of the best guitatist and song writers.This Cd has nothing to it.Bring back the old Santana
1, Santana unstoppable: This CD is just another example of how talented Santana can be. He continues to dominate the music scene and has been around for what seems forever... his music just doen't get old. This CD in particular has such a wide variety you can leave it on repeat all day!
0, Santana: ... he's pretty good
0, I've had trouble getting into this.: I don't get the hype. I've played this several times. I've started in the middle of the CD. I've played one song at a time. And I still don't get it. This is not good music. Caveat emptor! Mr. Santana
1, The bar band returns...: with a familiar cast of characters.Much like their debut album
1, Christina: Great movie!! Kind of cheesy but a good movie to watch any day. Would highly recommend for one of those days you have nothing else to do
0, More of a novelty book than actual substance...: I bought this book thinking I would love to know the tricks of the trade for writing chick lit. I was WRONG! The book is written in a playful format
1," The greatest musical accomplishment of all time: ""When a true genius appears in the world"
1, I never laughed so hard in my entire life!!!!!!!: I love Daphne & Celeste
0, This is awful!! I MEAN IT!!: I can't beleive they would get a record deal!!! They can't sing
1, Not McGarrity's best
1, Like it: Started reading Xmas could not put it down. The best one I have read yet. Can't wait to read the next one.
1, Very Tasty Book: I like all of Steve Meyerowitz' books so of course I like this one too. Good info
1, 2 Green Drinks and Juices perday will make your day: This book is a wonderful collection of healingdrinks and energizing fuel for the body.It specifically outlines drinks for each particularailment and juice recipes to remedy the problem.Why pop a pill you cannot digest like eating a rockwhen you can enjoy a fresh homemade juice drink toawaken your soul and tantalize your tastebuds.This is an excellent book which I have recommendedto several people who juice for their health andenjoyment. Enjoy life....a pill is no fun.
1, Great Value!: I recommend this to anyone looking to get healthy in the new year! It's full of great recipes for overall health benefits
1, Fuzzy warm towel set: This set feels very cozy from first use to a year and a half later! No frays
0, They don't stay on the fridge: I really like the look of these
1, Alternative To Mainstream: Way of the Heathen is an excellently written instruction manual of Theodish Belief. Garman Lord takes great pains to explain step by step how to be an Heathen. Everything you need to know down to the smallest detail is in this book. There are explicit explanations of everything. Plus
1, Cuties: Ok....If you are Dominican and like Bachata
0, Queers in Search of Help: Terrible book. More parano than NEWS
0, Too heavy to hold!: This used to be a great (and medium-sized) magazine with at least one great article in every issue. Last year the format was changed & the darned thing is so big I can't read it in bed. At last look they still had at least one interesting article
1, Very heart-felt lyrics and personal: This is a very nice work: not plain pop-country
1, Of course it's good
0, Expensive bulbs don't last: I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.
1, NOT for use in CANNING: According to Presto
0, It simply burnt everything at my first use.: I purchased this cooker based on the customer review and
0, eh...: I thought this would be super fun for my toddler and preschooler
0, item appeared to be used and repackaged or resold: Item was clearly purchased elsewhere and resold to me as new. I have never had this experience with amazon before and am disappointed. Packaging was dirty and previous price sticker still attached.
0, This was obviously never proofread.: The text of the 10.55 paperback edition is nearly illegible. Some pages are entirely in computer code
0, Notes on the State of Virginia: I never received this book !Notes on the State of Virginia (Penguin Classics) (Purchased on 04/24/2009)
1, Delicious! Restaurant-quality food in a can!: Our favorite way to serve this item is to mix it with chicken
1," the Terror of the Carribean ""CAPTAIN BLOOD"": The legendary swashbuckler"
1, Errol Flynn's breathtaking major motion picture debut.: This film was a first on many counts -- Flynn's first collaboration with director Michael Curtiz and costars Olivia deHavilland Basil Rathbone
1, Have a confession about this film.....: Before VHS arrived on the scene for home viewing
1, Great book: This book is another great Suess-esic rhyming book that gives information about seeds in a fun way. Great for young children to hear.
1, You will not be able to put it down.: Better than tape!Once you log on the Net...anyone can find you! April 19
0, Gundam Battle Assault: I had a feeling this game would be more than less
0, Jerk Out CD single: I was very disappointed when I listened to this single. Morris Day really pulled a fast one on this. This song has a different sound than is on the album
1," Good: I do recommend these bar /chain combo & OREGON is the only way to go. The ""intenz"" adjust system works but binds a bit with sawdust. Wish they had finer adjustment. Chains are sharp & hold up great."
0, Verbose
0, cheap chinese junk: Very poor Chinese quality for the price. I broke 3 out of the eleven I needed. They seem to flex only one way. I won't buy these again. Amazon should state whether the product is made in the USA or imported.
0, Not for Barbie-age kids: This game is too complicated for my 7 year old. Even with my help she was frustrated. By the time she is old enough to play this game alone she will think she is too old to do anything with Barbie in the title. Save your money.
0, This game is too complicated for me
1, Great lights!: Purchased these to replace the bulb lights on my trailer. My trailer lights were having connection issues. Brand new trailer and I couldn't get them to work....ARGH! So I ripped them off of the trailer and got these! WOW! Easy to install
1, Terrific lighting kit: This kit came complete and was very easy to install. We put our boat in the water for the first time today
0," Are You Kidding Me???: What happened on this album??? The Starting Line took a few steps back with this CD. If this is their new mature sound then its probably the last TSL CD I purchase. ""Say It Like You Mean It"" is 10 times better than this CD. I have listened to this album numerous times and I just can't get into it. It doesn't have those catchy lyrics that I'm used to with Ken and the boys. I'm seeing these guys on the Nintendo tour this fall and I'll probably be disappointed because they will play stuff off this album and they will suck. If you liked this CD compared to their old stuff then you are LOCO!!!"
0," Stupid lyrics!!!: ""I'm gunna tear ur a** up girl""??? What the hell is that!? Were these guys in some kind of competition with 50cent to create the worst lyrics possible. On top of that"
0, Dropping The Bar: This is the first I've listened to Based On A True Story because the bits and pieces I had heard
1, Worth the money...: This is a really great album
1, Fits and Tastes Right: Let me start off by saying I hate the taste of municipal water. The chlorine and other tastes make in virtually undrinkable. That's where this filter comes in.For me
1, worth the money: The kangaroo skin version of this shoe is more expensive
1, Worth buying!: Now one would think that a rap song about a washed-up comic book character would be silly and/or stupid
1, Julian. Good orations
1, Seattle has produced a winner!: Being from the same city as Frasier and Niles Crane
0, how to rip off your past: This is not an Edge of Sanity album. This is a Black Mark/ Dan Swano rip-off of the the original Edge of Sanity band and original Crimson album. If any of the people involved in this had any respect for Edge of Sanity they would have at least got one original member to at least have a guest appearance instead of assembling a bunch of replacements that had nothing to do with the band. Black Mark doesn't need to be ashamed because they don't care about anything
1, a nice change: After reading the recommendation by another listener
0, VERY small neck: Not sure why more people aren't commenting about the neck size. This seems like a child's pillow. Very strange. It was very soft though.
0, more or less junk: I feel like a company that doesn't put an on/off switch on an electric appliance with heating elements might have some issues. It's also not the most ergonomic configuration-- it's very easy to spill water when it's full
1, Presto Electric Tea Kettle: This is an excellent product. It fits my needs well. The whistle lets me know when the water has boiled and the fact that you can remove the kettle from the base to pour the water is even more conveneient.
1, excellent music: I Don't own this cd yet (will soon) but the songs I have heard were great. My Fav. song is 'It's My Life'.
0, dissapointin: Ud think after five years theyd come back with quality material ... sadly not its my life and one wild night are barely ok the rest is garbage dissapointin and i thought their first two albums were incredible .. where are those rock anthems shot through the heart etc.....
1, Welcome back!: Crush is a good CD-not one of Bon Jovi's best
1, Excellent: I bought this album
0, are you kidding?: I'm sorry but this has to be the worse excuse for a music CD....totally dissapointed at Bon Jovi. This CD has ONE song worthy of being called Bon Jovi style music
1, Such great stories!: I could not put this down
1, An eloquent
1, One of the best movies with a goose bumped ending.: Voices is one of the most captivating movies ever made. The movie tells the story of a starry-eyed singer trying to make the big time and a deaf dancer who wants to be as successful. Inevitably
0, Drawn by the radio: I was moved to buy the album by their amazing song
1, Tinker
1, if you are a graham greene virgin you'll get hooked: this is a lovely portrayal of havana in the 1960's with a wacky vacuum cleaner salesman turn MI6 agent
1, a fascinating story: Maybe isn't it the most none story of G. Greene but this is a real intresting. He desribe Cuba before the revolution with a great talent and give an idea of the hidden World of the secret agent.
0, defective disc Number 4: This review pertains to the audiobook cd set. Disc 4 had some kind of flaw that would stop the disc and keep it stuck in the drive
1, Greene at his Most Optimistic: This is the fifth Graham Greene novel I've read
0, Ok in a hurry but...: This is OK if you are in a super hurry and have no other options. But
1, Good overall
1, Hard to beat Clive Barker: I have been a Clive Barker fan for a long time now and i've never read one of his books and not enjoyed it. The great and secret show is less old fashioned horror and more fantasy although it still has some quality scares in it. The imagination and concepts Barker has in this book are almost theological in scope and will definately absorb a thinking reader. The story worked well and kept me involved till the end. I am looking forward to reading Everville now as a sequal to this book. You will not be dissapointed with this book or with any Clive Barker book.
0, This refers to the 'abridged' audiobook
1, Blues at the top!: Excellent CD. Ann Hampton Callaway is a first class singer
1, Blues in the Night: Great selection of music. Callaway performs with great respect for lyric and melody. Good listening.
1, Makes drawing easy: A good and cheaper alternitive to getting a scanner. Helps makes drawings look professional.
1, Very High Regard: Recently
1, love it: I love this thing! Even if only for grating cheese it is awesome. I am still trying to figure out the slicer...I have both sizes but both seem to slice squash very thin. That is likely user error though.
1, Christmas gift: Delivery was fast. All the different attachments will be great for lots of different food items. Being professional grade it should last for years.All in all we are pleased with this item.
1, DA BOMB!!!!: Wow! This thing ROCKS! The only thing that would make it better is if it was self cleaning. I love it.
0, not what I expected: I purchased the salad shooter primarily to shred lettuce. The lettuce becomes mushy even when fresh lettuce is used. I have returned to shredding the lettuce with my hands and a knife. I also found that it did not work well for celery as it clogs up and does not always give nice slices.
0, Well engineered but highly time consuming to clean: While the Presto 02970 is functionally well engineered
0, Repackaged item sent as new. Item was broken upon receipt.: I have no complaints about the Presto Salad shooter
1, Works as expected: I just recently purchased this Salad Shooter because my daughter has one which has lasted and worked quite well. So far
1, NO MORE Missing Knuckles!!!!: I love spending time in the kitchen baking and cooking
0, super shooter: What a great machine
0, Worthless: I hope this is recyclable
0, WONT CUT AND COMES OUT MUSHY: THIS WAS THE MOST REGRETING PURCHASE I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! IT WONT CUT RIGHT
0, Presto/Shredder Pro 02970: I've had over the last 15 years the now extinct Chipper.It has been very adequate. Sliced thin chips and shred all cheeses. Time caught up with 2nd unit. I decided to buy the Pro unit to fill our needs. Definitely faster and stronger. Cones supplied do not have thin slice available. I have two sets of thin slice cones from the Chipper.Modified the shaft to shorter length. Now works with this new unit.Expect lots of service life in this metal gear unit. If you become depend on these gizmos
1," The Best Bon Jovi in years: I was a little skeptical when I heard the title song ""Bounce"""
1, Bon Jovi at it's best!: The best Bon Jovi album ever. So rock and roll and so hard! Riffs and lyrics are unbelievable. Should get more credit and more promotion. Definitely a positive album and inspirational. The songs tell great stories. I've had the album for 7 months now and I still listen to it constantly. That RARELY happens to any CD I buy
1, Excellent: This album is excellent. I like Bon Jovi
1," cant miss this!: Bounce is a great cd. Every song on this album rocks and it is a must have!i love the song ""you had me at hello"""
1, That's my Jon!: Always excited for new Bonjovi music! His voice sounds beautiful as usual. A few really good tunes
1, Bon Jovi Does it Again: I've been a fan of the band for about 15 years
1," Great Rock'n'Roll: Bounce is one of the best Bon Jovi albums. There are great Rock songs similar to the ones on Slippery When wet nut also a few wonderful balleds. It is great story telling. My personal favorite song is ""right side of wrong"".So whatever one like harder songs or ballads both are on Bounce"
1, Bon Jovi bounces into this era!: I have to tell you that this album is one of Bon Jovi's Best. They have made the leap into this millineum with this album. They seem to be closing the age gap and people young and old can appreciate this album. A few of the tracks are a bit harder than most long time fans will like
1," Bon Jovi does Metal???: Wow I didn't realize Bon Jovi could sound good doing Metal/Alternative type music. If you like that you've got to hear ""Hook Me Up"". But for my favorite song I must go with ""Love Me Back To Life"". Every time I have a hard time in life"
1, GREAT cd !!!: this is one of Bon Jovi's best albums to date! By far
0, Ugh.: Could have been interesting

0, Baaaaaaaaaad: Apparently the producers of this film has no budget for lights....Every scene is in the dark with a thunderstorm raging outside and ghosts houling in the background....and... Ricky Ricardo as Albert DeSalvo..Get the picture ??
1, Must have DVD!: I caught this movie at a small screening a few weeks ago. It is by far
1, Exceptionally beautiful vintage gardening book!: The photos are sharp as a tack to easily identify various flowers and plants
1, Great Buy!: Best backpack I've ever owned! Plenty of useful pockets. If you're not sure what to put in all those pockets
1, good: well here is a cartoon that is a little too american/patriotic for its own good
0, Altissimo! Ripe Off: The above reviewer basically has the story right in terms of what Altissimo! does with its recordings. They also use the same old tracks over and over again on different CDs. How many times can you repeat the same dribble again and again! This company has been trying to cash in on the post 9/11 patriotic feelings in this country by offering an inferior product. Again
1, LEGENDARY...INDEED: Im very
1, pretty sweet: packaging is awesome and well done! but i have to say other then the helmet its not as spiffy as i thought :p if you are a HARDCORE halo fan GET THIS otherwise pass :) or wait for when its cheap again :D if they ever do :x
1, Concise
0, More like spagetti: Buckwheat is one of the last of the listed ingredients and they are somewhat pasty as a result
0, self-indulgent rambling drivel: I suppose there is a certain readership that may be piqued by this book's ridiculous (and thoroughly disgusting) premise. I don't belong to it
0, I object to the language in this book!: I've read thousands of books
1, Good
1, slow read but great writing: Detailed account of Alaska moves slowly but beautifully crafted prose makes it a good read. Gives valuable insight to our legislation of Alaska.
0," What about ""no stars""?: As an Italian (who teaches Italian in HS and college in the U.S.) I really looked forward to a good film after one of my students recommended this one to me.As a professor"
1, Stealing Beauty: This is a GREAT movie! I LOVE the soundtrack! This movie is a fav of mine and got me into TripHop. DaveC
0, The Outlaw: I have heard of this movie since I was a teen ager (I am now 77).. it was about as sorry a movie as I have ever seen
1, Have Had Good Results With This Book: I have had very good results after buying this book. It is easy to read and digest. The Web site is easy to get into and is a great help. Therefore
1, Just what I needed . . .: to get out from the kitchen. This book had the answers to make a start-up a success. Thankfully
0, Chickenhawk's unite...: Currently this idiot is screaming into a megaphone down in Crawford at Cindy Sheehan's supporters. All's I can say is what goes around comes around...looking forward to it. And I laaaaaaugh at any of you who actually spent money on this book. Welcome to the Chickenhawk army.
1, Melt: I first heard Delta Goodrem at a friends funeral years ago
0, Really a book for academics and independent film buffs: Five articles in this book proport to examine bisexual men in American culture and society. However
1, Excellent
1," Anyone who seeks to understand real issues in this world should read this book.: The most powerful book I've ever read. The most fascinating non-fiction story I know. I realized I was living in a different world from what I used to think it was. It's difficult to describe how much this book had an impact on my breadth of sight.I also consent with the review of ""Ronald E. Parsons ""Ancient Reader."" Highly and repeatedly recommend anyone who seeks to be an independent thinker."
0, Don't Be Fooled Like Me: I purchased this CD thinking this was the entire book version on CD. IT IS NOT! This CD is a poor introduction to an EXCELLENT book about the Federal Reserve. BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!
1, The Creature from Jekyll Island: The book is very insightful telling things that I have always suspected and things I never would have thought of. For example the Rothchild Formula
1, Get Odelay Deluxe instead: All but the first two tracks are available on the 2008 Deluxe Edition of Odelay.
1, A miraculous story: This is a simply beautiful story. It is told with honesty and compassion. It is rare that I find such a meaningful tale amid all the commercialism of this season. I want to thank the author and illustrator for sharing their words
1, Filthy Gaijin!: The third in the Japanese historical series
1, Fantastic!!!: I saw Beowulf & Grendel in LA. It was fantastic!!!! I love Medieval adventure films and they just don't make enough of them. Sturla Gunnarsson and Andrew Berzins have given us a real treat here. The humor in this adaptation was a real added plus for me and I love the twist it gave to this age old tale. Iceland was beautiful
0, I didn't like this movie.: I rented this movie at McDonalds for a $1 mainly because Gerard Butler was in it and boy was I disappointed in the action and story
0, Now evil is good?: Fools who confusedly emote overturning the worldview of the classic and cannot figure out that good and evil have real meaning are doomed to destruction.
0, For Gerard
0, Not enough action and too much bad dialog: Grendel and Beowulf is yet another retelling of the epic 6th century poem Beowulf
0, Sci-Fi Movie with an actual Budget for Effects: I see why this had mixed reviews and didn't make it to the American screens
0, Liberal Dreck: Parts of the movie were fine. The Scenery was great and even the low tech monsters worked. The acting was fair to good. I could even get by the mixture of accents and contemporary slang.What killed the movie for me was the ridiculous and misplaced modern liberal hand wringing by the Polley character. The modern sentiments seemed completely out of place in 6th century Nordic Culture. A shame.
0," A waste of trees: What a dissapointment - this book is just a collection of the Linux Documentation Project's ""how-to's."" Back that up with a horrible index (a measly 7 page-index covers 2000 pages of text)"
1, not what i was lookign for: but one day i will try a spell just to check out my witching spell.. but i was looking for inter[retation of the candles
1, This is a great book that cries out for a map.: Shackleton's memoir is a treasure - an on-the-spot account of a great adventure. However
0, Could have been great
1, It's awesome!!: For beginners this book is really nice and easy to learn. I like this book very much and I recommend if anybody want to buy it.
1, Somethings wrong with the quality?: Is it just me or does Season 5 look totally different visually to the other seasons...nothing looks as crisp....Blanche and Dorothy look pasty and distorted....the whole filming of it is nothing like the other 4 DVD's.Still 4 stars for being one of my fav shows...but I feel the jokes are wearing thin during this Series and the actors look tired.
1, One of the great books from my childhood: As you read of the adventures of Tornado Jones and his family you are transported back to a simpler time. The book can be summed up as the adventures of Tornado Jones and his family as they fight progress and the build of a damn that will flood their old family home palce. It is a wonderful book I was first introduced to back in 1963 when my fifth grade teacher ended every school day reading out loud to us from this wonderful book.
1, Interesting Story: It is a nice short morality tale. The story itself is quite interesting
0, Failed within 13 months!: I bought this set for my husband's shop and he is the only person to use it. Two days ago the DVD player stopped dead. We used the cleaner and it worked fine with that. We played a CD on it and that worked fine but the DVD will not work and it will cost us almost 2/3 of the purchase price to see if we can get it repaired. I am very disappointed in this item. It is the second Toshiba DVD player that has stopped working with no warning. I won't be buying this brand again.
0," Just alright...: All in all this film appeals less about the world of soccer than it does to your typical everyday relationship flick. The comedy in this film is forced and anyone knowing a great deal about football will come away quite embarrased as to how a movie made in the breadbasket of the sport comes out so juvenille. The way soccer is treated here is almost like it was treated in the Disney flick ""The Big Green"" or ""Ladybugs.""If really looking for a film that correctly describes the obessive passions associated with soccer and how it relates to relationships pick up ""Fever Pitch."""
1, Wonderful: I love this movie. It shows the struggles of a young Hindi women trying to live in two worlds. Shows that no one ever has it easy.
0, Bend it - then break it: I bought this movie for my early-teen daughter after reading many reviews. It sounded like it was a feel good 'follow your dreams' story that would be uplifting for a young girl to watch. After watching it with my daughter I couldn't be more disappointed.First
1," A Film To Empower Young Women: This is one of the greatest films of the year. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" deals with a young girl who has a zest for playing futbol"
1, Great Film For Girls: This film is all about girl power and the ower of friendship. When it is over you feel as though you can conquer anything
1, Great fun!: I am not a soccer fan. That said
0, Not great: I beg to differ. The scenes in this book were repetitive and the grandmother too butch for a woman
1, this dude is no joke...: there are very few rap cds i would spend my money on but this one is money well spent. conscious hip-hop is the new 'gangsta rap'...
0, ugh: Maybe three stars would be a more fair rating....After all
0, Some parts of it are interesting
1, Yes
0," Do NOT buy this TV: We've had the 13"" Toshiba TV/DVD combo for 8 months and we are having the same power problem that other reviewers have had. I noticed the last time the television worked"
0, Toshiba Junk!!: I am having the same power problems. I called Toshiba
0, CONGRATS TO TARGET: THE PREVIOUS REVIEW OF &quot;TERRIBLE&quot; DATED DECEMBER 1 GIVES ME ADDED FAITH IN A COMPANY WILLING TO HEAR BAD NEWS AS WELL AS ACCOLADES AND THEN LET THE PUBLIC KNOW.
1, A Laugh-Out-Loud Read!: Although the story line of this book was not particularly interesting
0, Brave New Girl: Although the thinking of this book was interesting Louisa Luna only captured the little things and then seemed to go off. She talked about several characters that could've been rather significant in this book yet only mentioned them once & then never talked about them again. This book is easy reading and could be read in one day but i don't think it's worth reading. If Luna put more effort into this book it could've been much better. I personally don't recommend this book to anyone but if your up for light reading then this book is good for you.
0," What is poetry?: There has been much debate over the past ten years of what constitutes poetry. This book involves a broad scope of what is now considered poetry and why very few people ""like"" poetry. To sum it up"
0," Sad to say...: Generic rock n' roll. We've been hearing ""cruching chords"" as one admiring reviewer put it"
1, Still More Stories from Grandmas Attic: This book came in very good shape. We ordered it for our daughted who enjoies thel serlies very much.mama too.
0," No wonder Nietzsche called Mill a ""blockhead""...: In the Introduction to ""On Liberty"
1, love it: i think i am being a bit bias
0, Dissing Jessica Stein: This film
1, Kissing Jessica Stein: This film is about relationships
0, Item Recieved is Different then What is Advertised.: The item for sale is advertised as Land O' Lakes Traditional Half n' Half Creamers
1, Excellent Book: I had the chance to meet the authors at Brainshare 99
0, Novell's Guide to NetWare 5 Networks: I was looking for a complete guide to NetWare 5 for a new network operating system user. This is not it. The was written by experts for experts.
1, Much more than you expect...: Even if you are not a Halle Berry fan
0, He Gone...He Gone....: Really - who writes this stuff? I respect Halle Berry but she didnt deserve an oscar for her performance
0, I would have given it ZERO stars but that wasnt an option: This movie was horrible! A Grammy should NOT have been awarded for this movie... I have my theory on the Grammy that was given to both Halle and Denzel.. But I will say this
0, One difficult movie to watch: I rented this movie after the Academy Awards because I was curious to see Hally Berry's performance. Needless to say
0, Dissapointinggggggg!: I luv halle berry
0, Sorry
0," What was all the fuss about????!!!!: Halle Berry - I've seen her do better. Billy Bob - hasn't been the same since ""Sling Blade."" The premise was good but the movie's pace was waaay too slow. Another reviewer hit it on the head: being a racist doesn't go away in one night as it did with the Billy Bob character. Had high hopes for this movie"
1," A masterpiece of ""Passion"" and ""Tragedy"": Thorton"
1, Fine Film With an Exemplary Cast: This simple tale of two lonely finding each other may not rank as one of the great films of all time
0," I know what it tried to say: This movie wanted to be so more than what it actually was. I love dramatic cinema but this movie was garbage.I didn't buy Halle in this movie and can't see what the she got the oscar for. The ""love"" seen was way over done and added nothing to the movie. I think that Halle Berry was way to pretty to play this part. I have a hard time understanding how a woman that looks like that would have no options except grungy old Billy Bob. Its just not going to happen that way.This movie wanted to be a statment that love can overcome anything including racism but the message I get from the movie is that racism can be put on hold as long as you get to hit the sheets with a woman that could possibly pose for playboy.Sorry but thats bullsh-t"
0, even greater than catwoman!: ooo! see halle act. act
0, No Cinderella at this Ball: After hearing all the hype about this movie I really expected something Great. Boy was I wrong! Yes the performances were good but nothing Oscar worthy. Halle Barry's role could have been switched with Sissy Spacek's role in In the Bedroom and nobody would know a difference. Both feature grieving mothers with a lot of screaming and tantrums with no real payoff in the end. Nicole Kidman was the true Oscar worthy performance this year for not only having to act but also singing and dancing on top of it. Monster's Ball moves at a very slow pace and after about an hour I couldn't care less what happened to these characters. When I pay for a movie I go to be entertained and with this one I should have stayed home!
0," halle is mediocre: An hour and a half of this movie was all I could take. I never once bought into Halle Berry's performance. Her dialect came across as more phony and forced than natural. Her ""give me what I want scene"" was meant to be taken seriously but she was so stodgy I couldnt help but laugh. The other actors are decent. The movie would have been great if it had been about Billy Bob and Mos Defs characters."
0, This Mess is not fit for a Porno so WHY an Oscar?: Somebody please tell me what is this? This movie was done poorly
1, Great reference book!: This book is a must have for any landscape horticulture student!Steve Still has retired from OSU but is now director of the Perennial Plant Association.

1, 4 Words and a Sentence: Funny. Flatulent. Repetitive. Clever.If you like the first two movies
1, Scene Cut From DVD: Can anybody tell me if the scene from GOLDMEMBER which I saw in the theatre which was cut from the movie and the DVD where there was a musical number for Mini-Me
1, Best One: I <3 Goldmember sooo much. It's definitely the funniest one in the Austin Powers series. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.
0, Mild: I loved the first two
0, Austin oh Austin: Alright let me say that this movie is [junk]
0, PLEASE....: Im sorry
0, Way Too Much Bathroom Humor: There are just way too many scenes in this film
0, A Disgrace To The Series.: The first 15 minutes of this movie is the funniest thing about this movie.There are some other funny parts
1," Goldmember is golden: My husband and I went to see this together as with the first two. We both thought it was great. All three have become a family tradition. At the second film I was pregnant and felt my son move for the first time. He now loves Austin and when he wants to watch he will say ""Yeh Baby"". At work we all talk about the movie and try to be P/C while doing so. Anyone who loved the first two will also love this one. I hope that Mike keeps making these great films. The only thing I would remove is the inclusion of emotional drama and I would include more of the prior cast. Even with that I will continue to buy all Austin Powers movies and support Mike in all future ventures in film."
0, Winner of the Golden Fleece Award!: ... I had heard it was not so good
0, A waste of money: I had bought this unit somewhere else
1, Just used it for my Comp 1 class: Had mainly purchased this for my Comp - 1 class. It was pretty helpful then
1, what is soul singing!: the title of this review is the jeopardyesque answer to the question that the music of this album brings forth. this album of music on cd format is soul music at it's zentith on display and should be considered a compulsary for music collectors and lovers. consider the first four songs performed on this album
1, Informative and entertaining mystery: As a life-long Philadelphian
1, Great Transaction: I appreciate the quick shipping and the accurate condition of the book! Thank you very much.
1," There are a lot of mediocre staplers ""out there"". The TR250 is NOT one them.: The TR250 does a nice job of anything that needs heavy attaching. The acessory pak is a veryeconomical way of having the right staple."
0, Service was great!: Never got the product...it was to arrive on the 12th...so I called on the 12th and it was a great experience. A real person answered the phone after 2 rings and refunded my money immediately also sent a voucher ($20.) toward future purchase and a free shipping label in the event that the product came and needed to be returned. The Seller was Discount Vitamins. They understand the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE!
1, deep fryer: This is a great item and the only kind to use for deep frying--in my opinion--inside. Gets hot and stays hot.
0, Not too hot: We had a granpappy fryer for 25 years & wore it out. This new one did not heat up to frying temperature - perhaps we just had a dud. They sure don't build em like they used to.
1, Great--easy to use!: Great! It is quick and easy to use. It also does not take up alot of storage room.
0, DEAR ALAN PARKER AND OLIVER STONE
0, wrongful depiction: It is a wrongful depiction of Turkey and Turkish people aimed at defamation. I would not recommend it. Do not waste your time watching misleading information.
0, Nice try!This is the very stupid and worst film!: hate this film.and hate all players in this film.this film is full loaded wrong things and lies.Im from Turkey so my country is pretty beatiful and cool!so my country had fallen anarchy in 1978.and Turkey is bad position in this year and after two years.Billy Hayes get a chance! 
1, kept me hooked!!: this movie was soo suspenseful! i kept waiting 2 see what would happen next and jumping out of my chair! its a pretty good movie u should watch it
0, Horrible movie!: I really do not understand how so many people can give good reviews to such bad movies. I saw this in the theater and everyone was laughing
1, Panic Room: I couldn't imaguine what could be so exciting about a movie of two people locked in a room. It turned out to be a great edge-of-your-seat thriller. Jodie Foster again demonstrates what a fabulous actress she really is. There are believable characters and scenarios
0," Camera work gets the star....: Everyone by now knows the premise of this story. It's a sure ""hook"" to get the customer in. The camera work is creative and almost distracts the viewer from the story which doesn't matter since there is really no plot to follow. Kristen Stewart is quite good but for the life of me I cannot understand why Jodie Foster gets all the accolades. She is one of the most wooden actors in films. Check the dialogue at the front door. She's so bad I cringed. Her voice never rises above a monotone in all her movies and less is better does not fit this story. Her screaming scene isn't even effective or believable. In closing"
0, Not as bad as self abuse.: The DVD is not as bad as I had read it was. There are only 2 movies in the set that actually have subtitles. It is obvious that it was designed for the German market and Uwe Boll thought he could make a few quick bucks in North America. That said his early films are not that bad 
0, Lost one post within the first day: The product was beautiful! But the post came unscrewed during the first night I slept in them and I now only have one earring.... $40 down the drain.
0, Armed Forces (WW II) edition: The Seller did not state that this paperback was an Armed Forces edition - missing photographs et al.
1, Great gift!: I bought this dvd for my mom and she absolutely loved it! Great movie about love
1, Awwww: I for one enjoyed this movie. It is such a touching story. I cried several times. The story is good all the way through. I love Sam's friends. I also quite enjoy how Sam ends up helping others while helping himself. I must repeat again this is such a touching story. Sean Penn really did a wonderful job.
0, Spins its wheels real hard
1, really good movie: This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. It made cry throughout the entire movie
1, A neat look inside the writer: This was an interesting book b/c it gave insight into how she played with plot and story lines and ideas and her insights and inspirations in coming up with her tales. It's unusual and hard to explain
1, nice read: nice rainy day book for the couch in cuddle in the bed and read
0, Did not care for this book.: Letter format did not appeal to me to. Just did not care for this type of reading I prefer a different format.

1, sink protector: This fitsn in sink very wrll. protects sink bottom from scratching. have always used a sink protector and this was very economical
0," not what I ordered: I ordered this movie for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Boy were we surprised when he slipped the disk in and on came ""Mandingo"". What gives? A lack of quality control somewhere"
0, The Necronomican is a work of fiction: People are SO gullable
0, Zipper Broke: The zipper broke on this within two weeks of use. I was looking for a large backpack for my high schooler
0, Great size
0, Why does the review not mention the author's strong religious background?: I am returning this book after opening it up and reading more about the author. This book has a lot of 5 star reviews
1, GREAT MUSIC RECORDED IN A DRUG-INDUCED HAZE: As with much of the music of the late 60s and early 70s
1, my favorite neil young.: this is not going to be for everybody
0, Huh?: It's obvious that most Neil Young fans are thrilled with him no matter what sort of dreck he comes up with. But speaking as a long-time (since Buffalo Springfield days; I saw the first CSNY concert) fan myself
0, Slow and Boring: For me
0, A very good book not to read: Heinlein wrote some significant books
0, A Giant Surprise is A Giant Rip-off: Nothing Narnia here
0, Horrible: I bought this cable to use with a 120GB external hard drive
1, Mountain: If you're a Mountain/Leslie West fan.....THis is a must have. Great classic rock guitar and live music
1, Why no version for Macintosh?: I love Hallmark and really want to buy this software but there is no version for Mac.
0, Does not work for 2005 Sonata: This Bosch filter stated it would work for a 2005 Sonata. It did not. It is a one-piece filter and the 2005 Sonata requires a two-piece filter.I also purchased a TYC 800018P cabin filter for my 2005 Santa Fe on the same order and it was identical to this Bosch filter. The only difference wasI paid $18.44 for the Bosch filter and $12.38 for the TYC filter. Buyer beware of this false advertising.
1, tom jones cd: Product was delivered very quickly (I live in Australia and thought it might take a few weeks)less than 10 days and in excellent condition. Thank you for the fabulous service.
0, not the toy of old: The Tonka Tough Graders really isn't so tough
0, In the Garbage ...: is where this belongs
0, Disappointing: I was surprisingly disappointed by this album. What's up with the grade-school level lyrics anyway? At first
0," Every ounce of personality has been squeezed out of Weezer: Weezer's comeback albums have progressively devolved from ""shallow but well-crafted and fun"" to ""slapdash and clumsy but endearingly silly"" to ""workmanlike"
1, Amazing Album: I absolutely love this album. Each song is incredible. Sure it's no blue album
1, Great weezer sound with deeper
1, Lucinda is a genius!: Lucinda has such a way of conveying emotion and drawing you into what's she telling you. Lucinda is a genius.
1," GRUNGE? OH C'MON GET OVER YOURSELVES PEOPLE THIS ISN'T GRUNGE!: OK...WHY IS IT..THAT WHEN A BAND GET'S HEAVY EVERYONE SAYS THEIR ATTEMPTING GRUNGE? That is totally not it..and I'm sure if you ask the band they were not aiming to go ""Grunge"" Get over yourselves people! This is straight forward metal. I think it's their heaviest at the time of this release. All you ""Grunge"" know it all's need to get over it!"
0, disappointed: My mistake
0, Lesson learned...: To say I was disappointed when I recieved this 3 inch by 3 inch book would be an understatement. I have purchased numerous other books in the Dummy line so was not expecting this miniature book. Had I read the reviews like I usually do
1, Awesome!!: This is a must have CD for any Jimi Hendrix fan. The disc consists of a collection of various concerts when Jimi was at his best live. A couple of tracks even catch him joking around at the microphone. The sound quality is exceptional
0, Watch in Fast Forward: While it tries to follow in the footsteps of Snatch and Lock Stock
0, ummmmm: I didnt get the dvd with the cds so obviously im dissapointed that I paid for it and it was a no show.
1, Great Concert: Great video. Excellent quality both visually and audibly. Like the fact it came with 2 CD's of the same concert so it makes it easy to burn onto Ipod to take anywhere!
1, A Spellbinding Concert: Loreena McKennit's CD/DVD set Nights from the Alhambra is one of the most amazing performances I have ever heard. The sound quality is incredible and having the DVD makes it feel like I am there.
0, Better off getting a different one: I purchased this for my trip to the UK. It shot sparks when i plugged it in and i had to wiggle it to get it to charge anything. I was there for six weeks and I could not charge anything! I ended up having to get a UK power cord for my stuff instead.
1, Exactly what I needed: I bought this and adifferent adapterfor a trip to London. The other one was larger and kept falling out of the outlets; this one was fantastic. It worked with all the grounded things I plugged into it
0," ""Rise To Ruins""..: ..I was a HUGE Kiss fan before this album. As soon as I first heard ""Rise To It"""
1, A must-read: The best book I have ever read about Muhammad Ali
0, Odd design - sizes are off.: The pocket design on these pants is weird which you can already tell a little bit by the picture. The insides of the pocket are white and because of the way it's cut they are always exposed which makes it look very odd. Other than that the sizes are off - the small is a medium at best. I would just go to your local store instead since I tried to find similar products on the website but they are way too expensive.
0, Shoddy workmanship: Champion Men's Double Dry Classic Fleece Open Bottom PantI can't believe the poor workmanship on these pants. 1st the seam on the right leg is sewn crooked
1, This Paint Really is Washable: These paints are terrific. They cover well. They are bright. They clean up with ease. They wash off skin
1, get studio style photos at home: It's simple to use with my Canon printer.I took pictures of my new grandson with my digital camera -printed them on photo paper and the results were great.A professional photographer made shots for the announcements.They were scrapped and mine were used.
1," Jimi the Essential: I have so many of Hendrix CD's but this one is my favorite and rare. My brother mentioned this cd was at a Beer Pub in Texas and this actually has the only studio version of the song ""Gloria"". it was the only reason I bought this. Thank You Amazon"
1, Pretty Good Smelly: This stuff smells pretty good. I don't know how to really review a cologne
0, Rubbing Alcohol: I bought this product from Amazon as the seller
1, perfect size: My daughters and I love hot tea in the cold weather and often want more than just one cup you make with the tea bag. Also
1, fun times: My daughter got a toy kitchen. Now she can make a burger. Very durable pieces. Love it and will last.
0, Used once: I bought a pool from you a few years ago 
1, super toy: My son is a huge fan of legos
1, The Ultimate Minneapolis Sound Album: Now
1, Ian Rocks: O.K.
1, Great Designs: I agree with the previous reviewer
1, One of a kind: They were together in Buffalo Springfield and in CSNY
1, as great as I remember: this album seemed to fall off the face of the Earth for a while
0, Worst 3 Books of the Series: This book and the 2 that follow are easily the 3 worst books in the series. These 3 books should have been 1 book instead of 3. They are slow and full of usless jabber. If these books had been combined into 1 book
0, Don't waste your money.: This book is not worth toilet paper - which is long on fiction and short on fact. Don't waste your money.
0, Minimally informative and very repetitive: This book presents a very clear explanation of how stocks work. Unfortunately
0, Self serving Book: I was very disappointed by the book. Nothing new in this book that has been explained before.He keeps you going until he explains that he has a website (that is free for now) that can be used to make you rich. How long do you think it will be for free.I am actually sorry I bought this book
1, Really Great
1, Financial Advice books: This offers solid and easy to understand advice on investing. I have given 4 copies to family and friends after reading it.
1, Great Starting Point: This is the perfect book to start as a Value Investor.Greenblatt will show you the way to find out of favor stocks that are poised to make a comeback and putting statistics on the table as good books do. No accounting background needed and no need to suffer boring technical stuff and even better is that after finishing the book you won't have to walk alone because Greenblatt offers his website for free to find investment candidates.After you finish with this book I would suggest you to try the Little Book on Value Investing by Christopher Browne.
0, Disasterous Advice: I read this book and used the web site service in an attempt to earn the returns described in this book with disasterous results. Perhaps I mis-understood the concepts of the book or did not do a good job in weeding out the good picks from the bad picks but nearly all of the companies picked by the magic formula website during my trial lost more than 50% of their value
0, Are you a Trader or Investor? -- Traders Stay Away...: This book is about buying value
0," This book falls ""short"" in this market.: Having been an investor for years"

0, Very
0, Worst book I ever read!: I read this book long ago
0," Not so much for fairytales: Not so much for stories of ""little black negro's"""
0, Would not purchase again.: Bought this for our anniversary. Leather is the third year traditional wedding anniversary gift. Loved the picture online. Ours came with many things wrong with it. Was not happy. Also they call it wall art
1, Absolutely Brilliant: I thought this book was enlightening in the simplest way if that makes since. I think that everyone at some point in time should sit down and read this book and really take the time to ponder on what they feel is the moral of the story. It made me laugh out loud at times and at others made me question the road that I am on. Brilliantly written.
1, thanks for the book!: thank you for the book which was in excellent condition and at a cheap price (as described)! i appreciate it!God bless
0, Not much here: I was hoping for an edition of the poem that would help wade through the arcane verbiage and perspective of a 350-year-old mind. I was hoping for an introduction
1, This is a heavy: I just wanted to see what it was like and it is going to take some time to get through it but it is very interesting
1, Book for school: Im not a huge fan of serious novels because the world is tragic enough. But this book met out needs for a school project.
1, PL: Great read! A true classic! Was a valuable text to have read heading into college. I would suggest this to any person looking to take thier understanding of literature to the next level.
1, The book to end all books: Be not mistaken: this is the finest piece of literature ever written. Ever. About anything. Few books even draw close. This is Milton's tribute to the English language - the English epic poem that draws near then surpasses Homer's Oddyssey (greek) and Dante's Divine Comedy (italian) The story of Satan's fall
1, Devils Advocate explained ;-): Devils Advocate introduced me to Paradise Lost. I have it as a paperback and think its great I got it for free for my kindle. Thank you Amazon!
1, Excellent Edition of the Classic: I was very pleased with this edition. It was somewhat large
1," secrets of professional turf betting: Excellent!!One of the best books on professional speculation around!! How rare is the man that understands mass psychology and how to ""copper"" the public. Heard famous speculator vic niederhoffer used to make this reqd reading for all new employees. It is a true gem on the great endevour of speculation and the speculative mind."
0, Great for radio & alarm - terrible for clock: The radio reception and the different alarm features are great! However
0, Good idea gone wrong!: I'm a computer geek
1, Interesting Read: In my book
1, My Favorite!!: I love this meal!! I add my own sauted vagetables
1, Great Necklace!: I love this necklace. I needed a chain thin enough to go through a slide pendant that I love. This necklace is perfect! Thin enough to slide through the slots and sturdy enough to hold it with no problems. I've worn it just about everyday since it arrived. Fast service
0, Not very good at all: This necklace is like a strong circle of silver. there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid.
0," False Advertising!!!: This is NOT a chain necklace. If you buy this product you will get an 18"" long"
0," poor design for actually USING this item for intended purpose: I gave mine to the Good Will after a couple frustrating months of trying to ""get used"" to the quirks.... which are:The slots for ""sponges"" etc."
0, Do not waste your $$!: I just threw this sucker away today! The area for the sponges doesn't drain at all
0, Forget the movie. Read the book.: The book is a memorable account
1, In my opinion the best film from William Bill Paxton: I saw lots of films with W.P.
1, Avid Reader: Overall
1, Underground Guardians - Protector: This book was a good quick read. I do recommend it for other contemporary romance action readers. I liked the chemistry between Holly and Mason. I was a little disappointed with the ending - the whole story seemed to lead up to a fight between brothers
1, Demonic Emotions of the Soul!: This album contains the basic elements which
1, I LOVE Danzig's music: I am currently awaiting the arrival of this album but owned in the past and this album rocks!!!! I love Devil's Plaything
1, To this day
1, Practical Guide to New Age Philosophy and Application: This is a simple guide to New Age philosophy with some practical applications to use such as charts
1, Good Stuff!: Color Me Badd's debut album after the smash single
1, good album: Forget N stink and the rest of the boy bands we ve now because we had these guys back in the 90s doing an allrounders job they could dance
0, COLOR WHO WHAT??!: oh baby
1, Monkeys are gggrrrreat!!!!!: Truthfully
1, Good Sci-fi examining law
0," One of the most godawful albums I own: What happened to the band! In the three year span between ""Wild Planet"" and this album"
0, Murky and Miserable - Again: I disliked the 2001 collection and made certain to check this out in the bookstore before buying. I'm glad I did. Much of the poetry in this collection suffers from the same self-conscious elitism of the prior collection. Great
1, Best griddle you will ever own!: In 1970 I was given a set of Presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle. At that time they didn't have non-stick griddles. Through the years the handles broke
1," Perfect: I have had a 18"" for the longest time (9 years) and it still works great BUT my family got bigger. I cook everything on this and its easy to clean between foods I just use a wet papertowel and the flipper to run it back and forth while its hot."
1, Changed the world of a 10 year old: My Grandmother owned an original print of this book when I was a child. When I read it for the first time at age 10
0, you don't need it: All you need to do is get some foam
0," Does not work with fore runner 101 despite being ""better together"": I have to give this item one star.While I am sure that it is a very good product it does not work with the fore runner 101 that I bought it for. Well you may say that it is for the 201 not the 101 so why would I expect it to work with the 101???....because it is offered as part of a ""better together"" deal with the101. It appears that the room required for the AAA batteries makes the 101 just fat enough so that this mount will not work with it. Unfortunately I did not figure this out until I had cut open the packaging for the mount."
1, GREAT story
0," why not call it the ""JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE CD""!?: This CD is about 80% of Justin Timberlake's nasty voice which leads me to question why it is a group called NSYNC. His voice is on every song and for long periods of time. You rarely hear Joey"
0, At least they ARE establishing themselves more: Unlike the stuff from the previous albums
0, (Not what I expected): N Sync
0, Has Beens: I'm embarrassed to admit that I actually bought this album when it came out. After listening to this album twice
0, Worst Song/CD I ever heard: N'Sync is terrible in this album. They try to be different but it just sounds messy and very poorly produced. If you like their past albums you will hate this one. The only reason N'Sync sells CDs is because people think that they are so talented which i thought they where until this album was released.
1, The best is yet to come!: NSYNC just goes to show that POP music is ever evolving and changing... in the know on what's hot for the POP generation
0, crap: I bought this cd because I kinda like pop and I liked this i promise you. I was expecting something DECENT but all i got was wasted money and too much trying in their vocals and repetitive beats. Sure they may have wrote some songs....but at least write good songs. Maybe its not all about love and pop. If you want real music go away from [...].
1," A BIG Change!: In ""Celebrity"""
0, one good song
1, Celebrity ranks TOPS: When Nsync's prior two albums [NSYNC and No Strings Attached] came out I though that it would be hard to top
1, Intense: I think that this album can be summed up in one word: Intense. Its a great album. I think Nsync realizes that the sound of the music world is changing
1, Worth every penny!: I bought this CD on the day it was released. I love NSYNC more than any other music I've ever heard. It's not so much the songs that get to me
0, NSYNC?: i would not recomend NSYNC to anyone. they are just another backstreet boys wanna be. I do not think they have the required talent to be labelled as a good group. They are just another gurlie soundign wanna be boy band. They blow and they shouldnt be considered talent! they sound like whiney 14 year old gurlz
0, The nightmare will have to end soon.: NSync is a perfect example of a huge marketing project that has risen to immense heights. Behind this ploy is MTV and the drones that watch TRL. MTV can
1, I need to share: I've had this cd for almost a year and I feel I can now make an educated review. I've been an *NSYNC fan for years. When I first heard this album
0, Not As Good As Some Make It Out To Be: I got this CD 2 days after it came out thinking that it was gonna be some great thing. It sounds like all their other CDs just with different words to their songs. They use no real instruments
1, Great CD: This is a really good cd.Their beats and rythms are probably the newest type that I have ever heard.They use a lot of computer made sounds and they put it with their voices and you come out with a great song.This is also in my opinion their best cd yet.Buy it!
0, horrible!: N sync is part of the worst genre ever. Every time I hear one of these songs my faith in humanity drops substantialy.DONT BUY THIS ALBUM.
1, This album is great
0, What is up with this CD?: I was so excited to get the CD! My parents bought my sister and I each one so we wouldn't fight over them. When I listened to it I was so sick to my stomach that I told my mom to sell it .... It sounded like a bunch of junk. Who wants to hear about a bunch of guys that get cheese everyday? Don't waste your time buying this CD. I look at them in a whole different way. These guys are only in it for the money and don't even care about the message they are sending out to kids today.
0, More pop music from the assembly line...: Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning. Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums. They rock and they'll blow you away musically. They have guys who play their own instruments in it
0," Celebrity is an ego trip: NSync first really good album was ""No Strings Attached"" it was catchy with wonderful dance musice and ballads. Now comes the much anticipated ""Celebrity"" what a let down. Thought that this album would be a step up for NSync instead it was a step down. Seems like the boys don't sing enough"
1," Celebrity Is 'Ncredible!!!: I bought this album the 1st day after hearing some samples. Let me tell you one thing...this album is really good for anyone...not just for ""pop"" fans. ""Pop"""
0, GARBAGE: After 1 use this piece of junk became stuck and I can't even remove the black insert to change it out. Do not buy this or anything else from Kegworks. Their customer service wasn't the least bit helpful and would not offer a refund or even an exchange. Probably the worst customer service I've ever heard. I own a bar and WOULD have bought quite a few of these but won't be spending another cent at Kegworks.
0, Text-to-speech NOT enabled! NO THANK YOU!!!: Anyone that would sell a horse with a bad limp for the same price as a horse without a limp deserves at least a review written on it. Same analogy with the Kindle book with the Text-to-speech DISABLED (selling a damaged product) but at a comparable price as good Kindle Text-to-speech ENABLED books. Sure there will always be some buyers thinking it's o.k. I for one
0, Poor service: never received product. I contacted the seller 2 times and no response. I have filed a claim with Amazon to see about getting my money back. Seller had no problem charging my card asap.
1, The Dark Horse Favorite: Put 10 Slayer fans in a room and ask them what they think the best Slayer album is and 9 of them will say Reign in Blood.I am number 10. In my opinion South of Heaven is the best Slayer album to date. From the opening riff of the title track through the last scream on Spill the Blood
1, First slayer cd: This is the first slayer cd I bought. This is also the first metal cd I bought.I have officially been converted.If you like good metal
1, Hard to like at first but after a while its awesome.: First of all the first few times I heard this I didnt like it very much.I thought it was a disappointingly weak
1," SLAYER'S MASTERPIECE: This is one amazing cd. I've had it for a very long time and I almost never get sick of it. From the opening Title Track all the way through to ""Spill The Blood"
0, Disappointed!!DO NOT BUY!: It is useful. But it sucks! Too thin and can not set on desk stably. It looked like a second hand product
0, Too thin
0, Item not what it appears: I was not satisfied with this item. I thought I was getting a thicker protector
0, Mr. Crankypants: This is a good idea for a book. There is much to be criticized about architectural process & the industry. But what a chiding
1, Support the War: Killer drums
1, Best Slayer Album ever!.: This Disc is when Slayer was at their Peak in my Opinon and i'm not a kid... Rock on!!. This Disc is so to the Point 
1," Got PASSION?: That's great and all that every ""metal head"" known to man loves this band. I don't see what's so special. They're music is fast and furious"
1, Its good: This cd is cool for old skool metal fans but if you are into korn and limp i wouldnt recommend it
0, I was disappointed.: I bought this as a gift for my 21/2 yr. old grandaughter. It was to go with the kitchen her parents purchased for her. I was highly disappointed as it was much smaller than shown. I bought a much better set for half the price at my local grocery store! I will definitely be sending this one back!
1, Nutritional Education: I purchased this for my grandson along with a separate food set made by the same company. He enjoys pretending to cook and eat the food. He watches his parents preparing meals. What better way to teach nutrition and show that food can be prepared at home and not obtained from a drive-through. window!
1, Very Fun at The Time and Now As Well: These ladies were just having fun back then. Yeah the lyrics are a bit over the top but the music is pretty cool. I still hear Nasty Girl on the radio these days. Vanity
0, Nice case
1, LOVE THIS PHONE: I think this phone is great. The only down side is you can't listen to your messages without going to the machine. That's not really a down side though. Its sleek and cool looking as well as durable (I dropped it three times already). If you want a cool loking phone that has multiple rings
0, Horrid: I bought the version without the answering machines
0, No Battery Life: Let me first say that I initially LOVED this phone
1, AWESOME!: I have been a fan of glenn danzig ever since he was with the misfits and samhain
1, DANZIG IS THE KING OF METAL!!!!!!: Ozzy is over rated
0, Gets old quick: This is the first and last Danzig album I'll own (and I'm thinking about selling it.) The popular and yet mediocre tracks like Mother have become beyond boring and over played on rock stations. As for the rest of the album that is less than mediocre
0, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Unlike other reviewers
1, The Heart of World Music!: Just a quick note since I just listened to it again. This is an AWESOME album. Very mellow
0, Paranoia at it's fullest !: Shame...shame....shame....typical example of so called literature that is meant to keep people in a state of permanent fear and confusion.
1, Great Book on Islam & End Times!: This book really opened my eyes on what Islam and Muslims are really like. This book isn't really focused on interpreting prophecy but rather on what Islam and Muslims think of Americans along with how Islam will play a huge role in the End Times. This man really has a love for the Islamic people and wants them to realize the truth.
0, ok except for anti Western bias: The author puts forth this scenario where the antichrist is a Muslim
1, Thought provoking: Having lived in the same city in Africa as Ralph
0, Incorrect song titles: I purchased the downloadable version of this album (without
1, It wasn't God- Altar Boyz put the rhythm in me!: This was the best show that I have seen since Rent
0, Very disappointing: I recently purchased and viewed the entire Highlander series. I vaguely remembered this show and always thought Elizabeth Ward Gracen was a babe
0, Poor Crafmanship: I collect chess sets and thought this one looked unique. The set arrived promptly and was well-packaged. However
1," Showing my age: This album and the single ""Get the Balance Right"" are unique to me because the compositions are all straight-forward synth parts layered simply. No samples"
1, Beautiful rendition: I'm glad to have found this CD for an elderly friend of mine. She listens to it often and the sound is crystal clear for her. Amazon's delivery and selection can not be beat!
1, Good
1, Animal house meets the Firm: In The Pledge
1, Excellent Radio!: I bought this radio for my 90-year old aunt because shewanted a simple
1, Delightful read: I read the entire book during my commute on the train for a week and thoroughly enjoyed it. I couldn't have predicted the ending.
1, pure comfort: This is a extremely comfortable mat
1, A FAN: I live in England and read evey CSF book I could find 20 years ago. Whenever I visited the local public library I had several authors I knew would entertain me. Fleming
1, Forester's Classic World War One Tale: I read 'the General' shortly after I finished Forester's 'Hornblower' novels and was pleased to find that the same depth and adventure that Forester brought to the British Navy of the 19th century he also brought to the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe. 'The General' lets us into the mind of a British General in the opening months of the war. Forester's protaganist reflects the mindset of those who conducted the war and allowed it to become the bloody mess that history remembers. An Amazing novel.
1," Another pop master craftsman - can he save music?: Bonobo's ""The Plug"" is the only melancholic masterwork so far of the electronica sampletronic musical revolution. Nothing Moby has done"
1, One of the best albums of the 1980's: This album really grew on me
1," Often Seen As Their Weakest Album: ""The Queen Is Dead"" is the Smiths album that receives the most praise"
0, Nice looking but didn't work or last well: Great looking and seemed to be of high quality but out of the box there were problems that got worse over time: kettle leaked when the water boiled; it didn't whistle all of the time; due to the spherical design there is not a lot of flat surface for the bottom and on our gas stove it was often unstable until you adjusted it to sit 'just so'; the stainless stained and we could not get the stains out of the brushed surface; then lid started to fall apart after some time. In the end we asked to return it. I gave it two stars since the cost to quality/endurance ratio just was not very good in my opinion.
1, Spiderman: This was a great superhero movie. Peter Parker is kind of the dorky kid in class. They go on a science field trip and look at the different species of spiders. One got out
1, best superhero movie ever: The cast was fantastic bringing human emotion to what could have been a dumb effects-driven piece of fluff (anyone remember the last batman movie?) This movie had great pacing and detailed characterizations. the special effects were very dynamic if at times a bit cartoonish. the spirit of stan lee and steve ditko's creation of some 40 years ago remains intact with a minimum of updating to be contemporary. the bonus features are worthwhile and this is a must own for fans of the character
0, Does not live up to the hype...: Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure
1, tobey maguire: hey tobey maguire here iv'e gott'a say my movie sucked and i dont think i did good there were to many mess up's and cr** i just hate sam raimi for not letting me be in spiderman 4 f him
1, Spider Man Origins: This is a very well done movie for Spider Man. Like a lot of people. I grew up with the Web Slinger and was very thrilled with the movie.It's worth viewing for a Spider Man fan.
1, Spider Sensational: A day after this movie was released I was in line to buy a ticket. I am usually not fond of superhero movies or comic books but this movie made me think twice about that opinion. What a great movie! The plot
1, Special Effects Masterpiece
0, Probably the Only one: I am probably the only one who doesn't like Spider-Man. I did not like this movie for two reasons
0, I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life...: In my opinion
0, Very Boring: What can I say about Spiderman
0, spiderman?: I thought about giving Spiderman 4 stars but decided against it. This is the most boring action movie I have ever seen. Aside from the horrible CGI
0, Stupor-Man: An incredibly boring
1, Spiderman: The Movie: Spiderman is probably one of the greatest movies I have seen in a long time. It is packed with action and has a great lesson. IT is probably not a movie to show to younger kids but is great for anyone ready to sit back relax and enjoy a great movie.
1, Very Good! But a little too violent for kids!: I recommend this movie
1, Tobey Maguire Best Superhero since Michale Keaton: Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance as the soft spoken Peter Parker. He was made for the part. Tobey was not particually big or buff
1, Go for a spin: I had pretty high expectations when I went to see Spider-Man and I wasn't disappointed. Spidey's origin story is told nicely in an updated way for today's audiences
0, tired: This movie is everything I expected
1, spiderman movie great a#1: It was the best movie ever
1, Marvel's big guns...: DC comics has had it's days with the Superman & Batman movies. Now finally
0, overrated: simple as that. the movie was overrated and cheesy. toby mcguire looks like he's constantly seeing a ghost
1, Still Holds Up: I haven't seen this in a decade
0, Widesceen version on Pioneer DVD player: Although both the packaging and the DVDs themselves areidentified as the widescreen edition
1, BEST MOVIE OUT: Spider-Man is the best movie EVER and I can't wait getting the DVD. It's worth seeing over and over again! It should not be rated PG-13. Anyone can enjoy it!
0, What a rip-off!: I bought 3 sets of these sheets
0, Poor Quality: I received this sheet set thinking that it would be a decent quality since it retails for $112.00
0, Poor quality.: I too thought that these would be a good set for the price
0, disaster!: The description looked great - I have other jersey sheets which I like very much for for spring and fall weight. Turns out these are terminally cheap - so light weight they can't hold shape an feel cheesey as they keep coming off the mattress!Save your money!
0, Sleazy Sheets: Do not be fooled by what is listed as a high original price. These sheets are not worth even the low sale price. The knit of the fibers is large and loose
0, Returned without accepting from UPS: Unfortunately I ordered these sheets before reading the reviews. Within 1/2 hr. of ordering & after reading the reviews which convinced me the merchandise was not worth receiving I could not cancel because it was already being processed. I called Customer Service & the service rep. was so nice & helpful in telling me not to accept delivery - just refuse the package. I guess when I saw the price for the sheets I should have known if it sounded too good to be true it was. Thanks everyone for your comments & reviews so I didn't get 'stuck' with sheets that wouldn't fit
0, Beautiful
0, Enamel Flaking Off After Four Months: I use my kettle everyday for tea and loved it until the enamel started flaking off - slowly as first and then more with every passing day. Chantal was absolutely no help - essentially accusing me of letting the kettle boil dry (which I didn't) and offering me the option to purchase a new kettle. They DID NOT honor the warranty against defects and I'm utterly disgusted with this company. All Clad
1," A great guide for ""at home"" hoofcare: I found this book a great guide for me"
1, Great rocking music!: I couldn't stop tapping my feet or stop playing air guitar. Great riffs. It never gets old. A classic rock album.
1, Excellent Selection: This is a very polished and well produced album full of great songs and some techno mixed in to create a very popular album.
0, [real low point]: This is a real low point in ZZ Top's catalog. Eliminator was decent
0, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ: Further proof that everything they did after Deguello was an embarrassing waste of time!
1, OVERLOOKED INDIE FILM A MUST SEE...: Shooting Lily is an example of what smart indie filmmaking should be about. The story is simple
0, Useless: The content of this book is useless. You can find this information in Stock and Commodities or Futures
0, Tell tale: Product was damaged. I had to purchase it again. I was about to show it to the class
1, An awesome zombie flick.....: ....made to be a Zombie flick. There is plenty of blood
1, Quite Good Third Album: I am a huge fan of catchy
1, The first real DM's classic!: There are seven fine and enjoyable songs
1, perfect rock blend of songwriting
1, Our little cartographer was not impressed
0," Wrong size... Twice!: Both the Amazon page and the packaging indicate that the panels should be 84X63 inches. However the panels I received were 64X39.5"".I contacted Amazon"
0, Don't buy this or any other Chantal product....they are not an honest company.: I made the mistake of purchasing one of these without reading the reviews. It looked great when it arrived
0, Nice Story
1, Irresistible party/dance/whirl-around-the-house recording: A friend gave Yalla to me a few years ago. He heard it in a little combo exotic food/CD store
1, What a deal!!!: I bought these for Christmas presents for a few people - and they LOVED them! They were an incredible deal
0, Sheds Feathers Quickly and is COLD to the Touch!: I bought this product last winter (2007) because of the many good reviews. I would NOT recommend it for purchase because it loses it's feathers *very* quickly and becomes incapable of trapping warm air. After one season and one washing
1, Great read -- A mindblowing story: Don Delillo could not have imagined this. I was more blown away by 'Fateful Harvest' than by 'A Civil Action' or 'Erin Brockovich'. Those earlier works also had sympathetic protagonists
1, Outstanding Value: This case is well-built
1, Great Bag: I really like this camera bag
1, Close Look at Sicily: Writer is talented and personable. You feel that you are with her in Sicily. In depth
0, not their best: I consider myself an Aersomith fan... I got all their albums and I think that this is their worth album
1, Highly superior to duct tape!: I have used this product for years and love it. It's great for semi-permanent and permanent repairs with absolutely no degradation from the elements (weather). It can be removed without a sticky residue. Duct tape leaves a horrible sticky residue and the adhesive starts to degrade over time. Unfortunately
0, Lowest book club score in a long time: If I could have rated this book lower than 1 star
1," Charles Williams the storyteller: This is my favorite of the seven ""metaphysical thrillers"" by the British writer Charles Williams"
1, Makin' me hungry: These little groceries are really great representations of real food products. The plastic cans are shaped just like real food but scaled down for little hands. The labels have great graphics
0, HDTV WONDER NIGHTMARE: I spent days and nights trying to install this card on my computer even when my computer over pass all the hardware and software requirements. The image quality was not that good after all and the image also keeps flitting and freezing. I rather keeps watching my regular home TV and save the money and the frustration.
0, boring: if you liked Cocks' book
0, Terrible! Horrid and Boring Story: This book is easy and short
1, Great scent at a great price: This is a hard to find scent
0, Too jumbled and one-sided: I had very high expectations for this book. I've read the author's work before (At Play in the Field of the Lords) and found it extremely impressive. I was also very interested in this subject. However
1, Interesting book: This is a nice book for film lovers. Ebert answers all types of questions from his readers. These questions range from script development to film review to questions about individual actors and directors. Of course
0, Not a lot new: I had higher hopes for this book! Alas
0, Not very comfortable: I would like this leg rest better if it were straight across on the top. I couldn't get a green one
1, More than Worth the Price: More than Worth the PriceThis is a great product that fully lives up to the Sangean reputation. It's the third radio
0, Many logic failures: My Sangean RCR-2 is possibly defective
1, Just what I've been looking for: These types of products are always useful
1, Pop and nothing but pop: This is no goth masterpiece and probably should be avoided by those who just want to hear the dark Cure. If you really like their more upbeat stuff this is definitely worth having.
0, The CIA Meltdown because of a girl??: All you need to know about this movie (horribly overdirected as usual by the insecure Tony Scott) is that all the gyrations
0, Spy Game: I hated that the captioning would not stay off. I ordered FOUR copies with the same results. I did return the copies. However
0, Be careful: The first run of these DVD's are defective. They have problems with the Closed Captioning for the hearing impared being turned on by default (I verified this on two DVD players plus a PS2
0, A John Le Carre imitation: Too much fluff. Too much imagery without any character development. Brad Pitt's charcter or that of the English girl (for whom he supposedly goes rogue) is underdeveloped to the maximum. Also
1, Great team
1, love it!: if you're a rickki lee jones fan this one is a must have for your collection! as well as all her other cd's.
1, Catchy songs with a touch of darkness: New Order is great
1," Prototypical new-wave dance music: This is some of the most infectious synth-pop music I have heard. Starting with ""Temptation"" and ""Blue Monday"
0," Worth boycotting on principle: New Order was a singles band who did their best work in the 12"" format. However"
0, LOTS OF ERRORS!: I'm an EE undergrad
1," Excellent place to start with microcontrollers: This is a great book for learning a ""beginner's basics"" in microcollers. I give it four stars because of the misleading cover images of robots. There is nothing in the book about making a complete robot"
1, OK great book!!! But???: This book is ok if want to build the robots explained in the book or useit to expand your knowledge. The reason I like this book is because he use's both the PICBASIC and PICBASIC PRO to program the robots. But it has too many errors and some of the projects are not fun enough to excite robot hobbyist at all. I wish he make another book which has more projects. Still the book is great!!!
0, serious lack: I got this clock a week ago and I am observing it's performance closely. It is indeed an atomic clock; however
0, Jovovich great! The movie rots!: I admit
1, Awesome movie: I like it but I like part 2 better. Awesome supense. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are hot.
0, Resident Evil fans need not apply: This movie was not at all like the game. They put a big twist on the first resident evil
0, Good from a game
1, bow to the evil baby!: I am a fan of the R.E. I have the games
1, Great Movie: This movie was great. I DO play video games
0, I should have picked Ice Age...: Ok
1, The Best Horror Movie Since the First HALLOWEEN!!!: I went to see Resident Evil at the movie theaters
0, Special effects look exactly like that of a computer game
1, Downtow Assassin: weel as far as i'm concerned some people really bug me out when thye say that this movie is bad 
1, Milla vs the Zombies - I'd bet on Milla: It seems that one cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a zombie these days. In this ultra-modern zombie flick
0, Too boomy.: Well made
1, A Wave of Coolness: This is my absolute favorite album ever. The first time I hear (the song) Guitar Noir I was blown away in a wave of coolness. The most intense surf music I have ever hear. The music is so complex and melodic. All the sounds are mysterious and haunting. This a masterpeice; the crown jewel in the heavy crown the aqua velets wear. The Aqua velets didn't record songs on this album they recorded moods. Also in the liner notes It says something about a book by Mongemery Green but I can't find any book by this guy. please e-mail me info on him. thanx
1," Strong album: Discovered the title track in the credits for the ski movie ""Edge of Never"" and bought the album the next day. I've listened to it a dozen times already and don't anticipate growing tired of it. The only lackluster tracks are: ""Twilight of the Hepcats"" and ""Moodswing Sonata"" because they border more on jazz"
0, Not pratical for learning any useful programming: I have tried making my way through this book many times. But I cannot get past the author's incessesant penchant for the mayan calendar. I did not find any use in going through code snippets (which are very hard to read
0, Not too good: The book is very hard to read. It starts out fine
1, You Can't Go Wrong With a Just Planes Video!!: This World Air Routes video by Just Planes Videos
1, J.C.Bach: Piano Concertos
1, Helps in relaxing: I bought this because I tend to grind my teeth at night. I listen to it before I go to sleep and it has helped me to relax. It also makes me aware that I am clenching my jaw and other muscles. It hasn't completely eliminated the grinding but I do feel better in the morning.
1, Friends while never let you down: This book was great! The Saddle Club's friend Tessa is at Pine Hollow but she has been spending more time with Veronica then The Saddle Club. But then the girls THINK she is make Lisa and her mom do more work then they can do for the big horse show coming up. And they also THINK she is make Carole do more work around the stable. And she is making Stevie angry and sad because they THINK she likes Stevie boyfriend Phil. Is Tessa doing all that stuff to them or is Veronica behind it all?
0, THIS BOOK WAS AWFUL!: THIS BOOK was so dumb. All it was was
1, Very good quality mount: Had to get this mount for our lcd. Saw it at Best Buy for double the price. We love the fact we have so many options to position our tv now. The only problem I noticed is that the arm prevents our tv from pressing up all the way against the wall. Not that big a deal but it would be nice to have that flush look. I guess you have to give something up due to its versatility. Overall great mount. Make sure you drill into a stud!
0, Very sad-Israeli Propaganda masquerading as useful info: Sad that people might buy this misleading piece of propaganda & actually believe anything written in it. I returned my copy after reading the section on settlements
0, Extremely biased: Interesting enough presentation of material. Good if you are looking for information in support of the Israeli side of the story but don't expect non-biased information. It is written by the Executive Director American-Israeli Cooperative and his bias is obvious. I am very disappointed the Idiots Guide series would select such a non-neutral author.
0, Very Biased: On reading this book I am struck by its one-sided bias toward an Israeli view particularly of events in 1947-1949. It is frustrating and disappointing that the author chosen to write this book is a pro-Israeli activist. His pro-Israeli bias comes through clearly in the narrative of this book. It is frustrating because it becomes a propaganda piece
0, UNCOOL: Depeche Modes early work sounds dated and uncool now days. And at times embarrassing to listen to. I became a big fan of Depeche Mode after hearing the song Policy of Truth off the Violator ablum which is Depeche Mode's true Masterpiece next to Music for the Masses. Everything Depeche Mode did after 1985-86 is absolutlely amazing to listen to. I recommend Violator or Music for the Masses instead.
0," what even is this?: Even though I had already read and disliked ""A Portrait of a Lady"""
1, A Classic: This movie was amazing
0, Jack Deserves Better: This is a monumental letdown. Historically a hodgepodge of half truths and theories about the crimes long out of style.Depp's character is absurd and bears no resemblence to the actual Scotland Yard inspector he was portraying. Quite possibly the worst Jack the Ripper film ever made
0, From Hell but not scary: Just looking to buy a good hooro movie and saw this a week ago. Not taht sitting on a stapler feeling. therfor I dizz it.
1, I start every day with this book!: If you could use a daily dose of victory then this devotional is the best. Not just inspiration
1," How in the world did this band ever slip through the cracks?: I bought this CD a few months ago based solely on reviews - never heard the music before (except ""Love will Tear Us Apart"") - that they were supposed to sound alot like New Order. After the first listen I determined yeah"
1," A worthwhile compliation.: I bought this album years ago and still enjoy pulling it off the shelf every now and then. Contains the beautifully haunting ""Atmosphere"" and the minor hit ""Love Will Tear us Apart""."
0, Just not enough heat: I love my Brinkman Smoke but the Electric Element didn t meet my expectations. It really doesnt generate enough heat to maintain the proper level for smoking.
1, Unusual Fictional Perspective: Fast
0, okay: I picked this album up in a local mall where Katie was performing
1, Invaluable Resource Guide That's Fun to Flip Through: Just a quick note to say how much I enjoyed the record book
0, nope.: This is as low as I have ever rated a Bee Gees cd. This cd is definitely not him. I don't even think he would've released this if Maurice was still around. That aside
0, There are better..: The book is too detailed for no reason in the first chapters to simple concepts (sometimes you think it is for idiots.)
1, Good Quality Books: This was a gift for my daughter who now has the entire series. She loves them and they are a good quality hard bound books.
1, Excellent Quality: this compatible toner work excellent on my Xerox xd120f
0, I had high hopes for this after seeing it demonstrated on HSN: However
0, This item has poor quality and is a disappointment!: I would have wanted to know that this teakettle was hard to keep clean and looked cheap. I bought two of these and am very disappointed with the lack of quality.
0, be aware!: I was not totally satisfied with this product. I have assembled 100's it items at home before but still the assembly of this one was quite confusing. The major source of disappointment was the way the stand looks once assemebled. Once completely assmembled
1, Its not just a book-its a experience: Crescendo had me hooked from page 1. I have done genealogy for several years now
0, Wasted effort: Perhaps the author's intentions were in the right place but the final product is a confusing
0, I dont recommend this product: After you use Sui Dreams by Anna Sui you cant even tell... the smell fades away in minutes. I have used the whole bottle in less than two weeks
1, Beautiful
0, Great show
1, I agree with everything said here.: I Agree with the above reviews and totally LOVE this album. I feel it's a stand alone Classic in world music. I just love the mood this album gives as the soul is enriched. I can't recommend it enough.
1, Ministry ROCKS!: Ministry is a million times better than the whiny Nine Inch Nails. Al Jourgensen can drop kick Trent Reznor and pimp-slap him til he turns beet-red. Anyway
1, I like it: This will not work for you as the first or only program for learning French. It is great as a supplement to other methods of learning French. The method is entirely intuitive - there is no English anywhere
1, Nice to play during a long drive: Good cd to listen to while driving. Nice lyrics and rhythms. I recommend it and I'm pretty picky.
0," I can't believe so many people love listening to this guy whine.: Colin Malloy's ""signature voice"" is an incredibly annoying whine. The songwriting is quite nice at times"
0, Huge Disappointment: I have to say I was very disappointed. I only liked about 7 or 8 crafts from the entire book. I thought they seemed too complicated and time consuming
1, She can sing!!: I like very much the voice of KD LANG so I like this CD. Best song: Lock
0," CD-ROM not compatible with Windows 98: I was extremely disappointed when I tried to load the CD-ROM and I continuously received ""illegal operation"" messages. I returned the CD to a local bookstore and they exchanged it for a new one. The new one did the same thing. So"
0, study material preparation for GMAT: I am a Chemical Engineer of Bombay University handling about 800 students for test preparation of GRE/GMAT & SAT. I find your study material extremely useful but the explanations given for Maths as well as Analytical sections are very long. I have picked up about 13 problems from The Barron's Official guide for GMAT 9th edition to demonstrate how problems can be tackled in real quick time.I am very keen to get associated with your setup for preparation and improvement in study material
0, A horrible
0, Been there
1, Classic: Not only is this record superb
1, Truely A Godsend: I was staying abroard for the first time in my life when this album came out. Upon reading about this band and seeing them on MTV
0, Poor choice if you want the facts on Iraq under Saddam: Unfortunately
0, Noodles were OK
1, A great investment: I saw a review of Kids Take L.A. in the New York Post and decided to give it a try. This book is a great investment - all of the family had a blast and we can't wait to visit L.A. again
1, Great Book: I bought this book in the mid 80's and I loved from the first page to the last.It contains letters of Advice from a father to a his son covering every aspect of life.Almost 15 years and belive it or not i still keep it next to my bed and read a letter or two every evening.Great staff and i sincerely recomed it.
0, No real insight into Aurora from this greenburg book: This book has nice pictures
0, Be warned: Do you use carpet powder? Do you have pets? Does your floor get dirty? Then this vacuum is not for you. Here's the problems.Carpet powder gets all over the place. Theres a hole at the bottom to create the wind tunnel. Problem is this hole is not covered in any way (Dysons are covered). When you use carpet powder all the powder settles in the hole and whoosh
0, Ultimately Disappointed: On my seconded one. Excellent vacuum: very lightweight and nice features such as great suction
0, not great....you get what you pay for: its tiny...its noisy...it picks up dirt better than your old cheap vac...but the filter gets filthy way too fast...then it smells. It has a fan blowing out the front for some reason
0, eureka optima: pros:small
0, Very bad wheel design
0, short lived: I bought this vacuum about 8 months ago. I wanted something cheap and lightweight because I only have one area rug in my house and the rest is hardwoods that I sweep. It died on me today. It just makes a very sad blown motor noise. It only got used for about 5 minutes twice a week for 8 months. Very short lived.
0, Waste of Money: I have owned this vacuum for 5 months and it does not do the job. For one thing
0, don't buy it: I got this vacuum because I read that it was light weight
0, Loved It...At First: This is one handy little vac...Eureka really made a cute tool. The problem is it shots more dust back into the air. I didn't realize at first why the kids and I were getting so many sinus attacks...but now that I'm using my 10-year old Hoover again we are clearing up. I wish Eureka would take this model just a little further and put a bag in it that will catch the fine dust. It is also very difficult to clean the filter because it gets so matted with nasty stuff.I'm currently shopping for another vac...this time with a bag (the thrill of cleaning out the dust cup crevices lasts only 2-3 weeks tops).
0, Laguiole Steak Knives: We had previously purchased a set of these knives from a different vendor a few years ago and needed more. The old ones were fine. This set was awful. They could not cut a straight line and were amazingly dull. I sent them back.
1, Many Good Mounting Options: Good quality. A lot of different options for mounting different speakers. Stability on carpet is good but not excellent.
1, Great Reference: I found this book to be an invaluable reference for my research in the area of compensation. It covers all of the main topics in compensation management with articles from the best minds in the field. The trend summary and chapter introductions provide an overview that is interesting and insightful. That kind of analysis is hard to find. The information is surprisingly up to date
1, BEN MONDER: IS HE A PERSON?: Excavataion
1, Cheap Shop Towels. No Problems.: They're a little rough and the weave is coarse. Don't use them to wash your face. I've used them for wiping grease off things and to apply polishing compound. They didn't leave red lint as others have complained
0, Not worth the price: I bought this thinking it would be much much better than your average instant ramen noodle. This was expensive! VERY expensive for what it is and it is not worth even half what I paid
0, Good mount
0, Great light
1, Easy to steal/vandalize: This is a quality light
0, Disappointing: I really liked this little light and used it everyday for 2 months. Unfortunately it's easy to install bracket
0," Not impressed: I'm not impressed with the organization and flow of this book. Perhaps it's just not what I was looking for. It just doesn't seem to flow to me as an ""idiot's guide""...and that's exactly what I needed as a first time mom looking for a good"
1, Useful & Fun: This book has my favorite cake recipes and the most useful recipe and tips on doughnuts that I have ever come across. A friend of mine borrowed my copy a couple of years ago and never gave it back
1, I play guitar but.....: Haunting
0, Unreliable and requires special antenna: I purchased this CB radio as a replacement for another Cobra CB that had failed. Only when I read the instruction manual did I find out that this radio requires a special antenna to get good reception on both the CB and weather channels. I elected to use my standard antenna
0, What happened to my order....: I understood I was ordering Volume One & Two (as the advertisement suggest); however
0, cooker is to be natural gas: I bought this cooker from amazon because i love the convenience of shopping here. So when our son picked this as a gift i went to amazon rather than where he found it. Numbers matched exactly. When it came it was in a busted up box the parts were out of their box and there was no natural gas connection or parts. Highly disappointed.
0," Low budget and low humor James Bond knockoff..: I was really disappointed in this film. I know the ""spy theme"" has been done a hundred times"
1," Good Transaction: While I would rate the book in ""good"" condition"
1, Sultans of swing: the very best of Dire Steaits: Excellent Dvd. My Husband has been looking all over for this piece
0, Edited and ruined: Dire Straits / Sultans of swing / the very best of Dire Straits: I hate to agree with the complainers
1, WARNING: YOU'LL WANT THE ORIGNAL ALBUMS!!!: While there is certainly a great hour to be had here
1," What have they got against ""Industrial Disease""?: This ""best of"" compilation is better than Dire Straight's previous one"
1, Great Compilation: This is a great compilation of the best songs of Dire Straits. My only gripe is that they cut out some of Money for Nothing
1, Fits and works: Not much more to say than they fit and they work. Fits in my 2003 suzuki savage. K&N has a great reputation and I trust them more than I trust the filters that can be found for about the same price at a superstore down the street.
0," American flag bandana: the American flag bandana is disproportionate and it says ""made in china"" right on it.. that's just terrible. I'm actually considering throwing it away"
0, Disappointing: I was under the impression that I was going to receive multiple bandanas. I received one. Probably would not have ordered if I knew this was the case. I would not recommend ordering from this account.
1, Perfect for what I wanted: I picked up a half dozen of these to get my longer hair out of my eyes at work
0, Poor Quality: I bought this product to go with a subdued pink camouflage pants I bought and love. It was cheaply made and basically looks like a piece of cloth with the edges sewn. There is little pink in it and the pink is so light it is difficult to see.
1," Even a Great Product has issues: I bought this bandana to use for skiing. I figured that the 27"" x 27"" bandana would provide more than sufficient coverage for my face and neck while racing down the hill. The only issue that I found with this product is that the fabric is not soft"
0, the black and red one is an abomination: We ordered several different colors and patterns
1," Garrett's Greatest: I had Siedah's cassett tape for what seems like 10 years now and it is worn to a frazzle so I upgraded to the CD. This CD has the ability to make you bounce to the its up tempo songs like ""Kissing"" and ""Refuse to be Loose"" and mellow down with the song I feel launched this album ""Nobody Does Me (Like You Do)"" and ""Innocent Side"". ""The Legend of Ruby Diamond"" well lets just say once you hear it"
0, Cheap
1, Best Study Bible I've Ever Had: While I have the KJV
0, To much Scofield and no meat !!: The only reason I gave it 2 stars is becuase Scofield gave it an honest try but
1, The Best: I just love the old Scofield study bible KJV. Of course the KJV inspired scripture is the most important thing. And the layout of the study notes and subject references is easy to use and very helpfull. The book looks good and was made with quality materials.I just wish the Large print would have been a little larger
0, Not so good: I tought that the range of this'd be more. Not too much diferences with the ones of the AP
0," doesn't work: When I realized how little these do (zip) I expected to find a manufacturer label on them that reads ""Fisher Price"". I buy no linksys gear anymore. All junk in my experience. By D-Link stuff. Far better range and performance."
0, Don't let your hope hight -- minimal performance enhancement: I'm using a HGA7T with WRT54GS. My router is placed downstair while all my desktops with wireless adapter is upstairs. It does increase the signal strength
1, Perfect for Public Readings!: Gorgeous colors and attractive images
1, Kids really enjoyed it!: I read this book together with my grade school children as part of their homeschool study of the Pacific islands. It was a very enjoyable and light-hearted story.
1, Form and Function: These speaker stands work well and look good doing it. They are currently holding my 30 year old
0, The Truth is in this book.: I havent read this book
0, Not for Sony Ericsson W300i: The charger was purchased to charge my W300i cell phone. It's cord did not seat well with the phone
1, 1 penny plus shipping: I ordered two of these because I heard some people got ones that didn't function. Both of mine are good
1, So far so good: It is a bag
1, I like it: It was just what I was looking for. Something well made with different compartments for items like shoes. The two handles that fit together on the hand straps is a nice feature. If I was to lose this bag
0, OH
0, Ocean?: This product smells nothing like the ocean. It has an unpleasant lingering chemical odor. I'll be returning it.
1, ALL WAYS A FANTASTIC CLASSIC
0, really widescreen?: Hitchcock's deliciously black comedy would be brilliant in any aspect ratio
1," STILL CREEPY AFTER 39 YEARS...: PSYCHO is Alfred Hitchcock`s only ""slasher"" film and it set a school for such films (Halloween and thousands of others)... Almost every scene is a classic and the music and photography excellent. Star performances from Janet Leigh"
1, Pure Genius: This movie is based on Robert Bloch's novel 'Psycho' about a real person: Ed Gein.Hitchcock's translation of this story into the movie can only be described as artistic genius.Janet Leigh has got to be up there on the list of the most stunning women to ever appear in films.The Norman character in the movie is similar to Ed Gein in quite a few ways. Anthony Perkins was born for this role.Once in awhile a movie comes along where everything clicks; the story
1, Personally One of my Favoirts: ... Well not much I can say that hasn't been said. DO NOT see the remake see this!This is by far one of the greatest films in Mystery and Suspence. I love it. and will never put this film down. Hitchcock is my all time favoirt director by the way.
1," ""We All Go A Little Crazy At Times!"": ...and this EXCELLENT DVD will drive you wild! Everything is top notch and the documentary is terrific! No doubt about it"
1, My #1 Can't-Live-Without Item!: I *love* the boppy for breastfeeding. It wraps so well around my waist so my little guy is positioned snug against me
1, Rosseta Stone Level 1 Chinese: Rosseta Stone's method of learning a foreign language is the way quite diffrent from other methods taught .As RS explains it
0, very depressing....: This book was my book club's selection for the month. It was one month I wished I would have skipped. Where the book is well-written
1, Older
1, Really good read.: This story really puts a light on friendship and real life situations that many people may face in their lifetime and how they may handle them. I am looking forward to reading the others in this series.
0, Sub-par read: 16 Lighthouse Road starts slow
0, don't buy this one: poor character development. no description. didn't care what happened to any of them . blossom st series much better. no editors to advise debbie on this?
1, great read: This was the first time I had read Debbie Macomber
0, Disney 3D Magic Artist isn't all it's Cracked up to be: When you are in the store and you see this software... IGNORE IT! It is so limited. The box says you can draw a 3D object
0, HATE IT!: I did not like ANY products from this line of makeup. This went on in a big blob. Did not look natural. I tried several different application methods
0, Awful for me: I saw this in an infomercial about 2 years ago
1, Great LP - now I have it digitally: bought this on first release - only on the basis of the original producers!!! It never grabbed me at first but year after year I kept coming back to it. Americana before it was so called. Then when I went digital I was very pleased to track down a copy (albeit no cover etc) on ebay.
0, the ultimate guide to weight training for running: Bad
1, One of the Better of the Best: It seems a general rule of thumb that if you enjoy the guest editor's work
1, Ojos Asi - Shakira: I bought this cd single second hand through Amazon. To start with it was as described in perfect working order - no problems. The music itself is great including the remixes. I am a belly dancer so I bought it for the purpose of dancing to it. But I would also recomend it to anyone who is a fan of Shakirah or likes Gypsy/ middle eastern flavoured music
1, The Way of an Eagle.: This was the first novel I have read by Edith M. Dell and I was very impressed! It is a Christian romance novel and contains much excitement and has many twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed it and want to read more of Edith M. Dell's novels. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1, A Good Movie With a Great Imagination Behind It: This a must see for Sci Fi fans. I just it saw today and the storyline was excellent. This isn't just another Dungeon & Dragons type of movie.I would most definitely recommend this movie. Non stop action with a great ending. I'll buy this on Blu Ray for sure.
1, This is one of our favorites: My wife and I consider Outlander to be one of our favorites. We already had the DVD but got the blu-ray for the better picture. Everything about the movie is better than expected: the special effects
1, VERY EXCITING.: I was going to give it 4 stars. Then
0, Subtitle mistake: Item description says spanish english/spanish subtitle
1, Wonderful story: You can't go wrong with Charles Dickens and this free Kindle version makes it even easier to read. Really funny story with characters who still inhabit our world today.
1, How I love this book!: This actually happens to be my very favourite Dickens
1, His first novel and should be yours too: I have read all of Dickens' novels and found them all to be wonderful. But if I have to recommend a starter Dickens novel to anyone I would definitely choose The Pickwick Papers. There is nothing more enjoyable and it is no wonder that this
1, I've read this book so many times...: ...that I carry it around as a permanent part of myself
1, Great Movie
0, To Cameron Krummer from Riverton
0, A waste of money: If only -0 were an option
0, Stink Bomb Alert: While not the absolute worst Western ever made
1, Too many bad reviews for such a great movie!!!!!: Don't do what the reviewers said about this film. THey said it was poorly made and things like that and tell you not to waste your time watching this. I didn't believe them so I watched it at the movies and I was amazed at this movie. The costumes are very cool and the sets are amazing. One set they used twice for two different cities. Ali Larter
0, Why do the bad guys always shoot at the feet?: This movie was ridiculous. Even if you go into it know that it's ridiculous
0, Letdown: This book was a major letdown compared to some other Xenophobe books I've read. The author constantly harps on typical
1, A Unique Collection: This book offers a unique and close to encyclopeadic collection of pictures and details of the currently sailing tall ships around the world. Having sailed on a few and seen many more whilst sailing in both Europe and the UK I found pretty well all of them in here.Thad is a reknowned photographer of the tall ships and has been for many years. This collection brings all of that together in one place with the usual quality and understanding of his subject matter that you would expect.I was particularly fortunate to meet the author and get a signed copy during The Tall Ships Race 2000...and no it is not for sale!:-)
0, Don't do it: This power supply is not worth getting. I noticed that it seems to lose power randomly. Sometimes you can play for days with no issue and sometimes you can play for an hour and you will get power loss 3-4 times. I would stay away from this one. I plug in my original Nintendo plug and do not have the issue at all so it is this plug.
1, great before and after: If you are looking for a book that shows you how to do makeup to go to work at your office
0, Spacesaver: These are truly a space saver. However
0, Not a True Space Bag: I gave this two stars simply because if you read enough
1, This one toasts the old Axelrod standard: The Axelrod atlas was the standard for years
0, Really old information: I bought this book last week. It is very short and an easy read. Mainly a reference book.It would be ok in hard copy but it SUCKS on the kindle because it does not have hyper linked table of contents. The table of contents is picture of a table of contents and difficult to see. Impossible to use as a reference book.I have read a lot of screenplays
0, Not helpful at all.: Everything in this book is too general to be of any practical value
1, History buffs are going to love this one.: I have seen a few excerpts from this and it looks amazing. By all accounts a extremely well researched
0, Extremely disjointed and unorganized: Reading this is like listening to the rambling stories of somebody not entirely in their right mind. Confusing and not ordered at all
0, This book isn't scripturally sound: I bought this book through amazon. What a disappointment!! If are going to buy this I recommend reading straight from the Bible along with it because there is definitely a conflict. Abraham
1, Superb Radio: This is a great radio. While it isnt FCC type accepted
0, Not what I expected: Ordered this to replace a similar 25 year old lamp. We didn't want to spend a lot but thought this might be a little better quality than the $50 Target or Walmart type. We were wrong. Lamp has a cheap looking finish with a cheap paper shade and the long stem is a two piece affair with a seam in the middle. Naturally it is made in China. Guess we should have known better than to buy something like this on line. The company
0, BIG disappointment: before purchasing this movie
0, records fine ..could not play it on other dvd players: I was able to record fine. I got it from costco for $120-$30.00 off = $100.00 with taxI can record (timer record) and play it on the Lite-on ddvd recorder but i cannot play it on the computer nor on other dvd players like the sony and samsung ....
1, Needs more connection types and DUAL-LAYER support!: Why make a DVD recorder that does not support dual-layer media? This is my big gripe with the thing
1," GRITTY!: This is not a kids book. Its in your face and the author makes no apologies for chapters like ""Dirty Harry was right"
1, A very good heist movie: The fun thing about this movie is that it isn't a prototypical heist movie. The heist was pulled off by a bunch of low lifes who basically lucked out. There was planning
0, Boring: Within the first ten minutes of this move I felt that it could be a waste of 90 minutes of my life. I was right. Simply put
0, Toshiba A-135 Beware: I bought this product from and through Amazon in March 0f 2007. When my kid went to reboot it

0, A terrible audio play of a fantastic book: I love LOTR
0, Why can't I just buy 'the two towers' !?!?: All I want to buy is 'the two towers'
0, Loooooooooooooooong and boooooooooooring: This was one prepostrous story. And it was unnecessarily long.
0, Poor quality
0, A terrible abridged version of a great book: I have just listened to part of this in my friend's car and I am disgusted. Not only is it the worst written abridged book I have ever heard
1, A must have for Ring Lore enthusiasts!: A beautiful book! Alan Lee brings the characters and scenes to life! Tolkien fans will treasure this edition of the greatest fantasy story ever written.
0," Mixed up order: The three volume set shipped included two copies of ""The Two Towers"" and no copt of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Having dealt with amazon customer support before it was easier just to have their mother buy the absent copy at Wal-mart."
1, Excellent!: The book was in excellent condition
0, Not what it seems: Probably my fault
0, Bring on the BBC!: Having purchased and listened to both the Mind's Eye and the BBC audio versions of The Lord of the Rings
1," spellbinding fiction in a badly bound package -: As a work of literature it is hard to argue that this must be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. A classic ""good will always triumph over evil"" tale that is exceedingly well thought through.The plot might be a little tricky to follow for youngeer readers"

1, WOW. WOW. WOW !!!: This is an absolute gorgeous book. This is something you keep on the shelf for the rest of your life and dust it off when you give it to a child or grandchild. Quality all around. Take care of this one. There won't be many books like this as we move forward in the digital era.

1, Something that everybody should read: Lots of fans all over the world
1, Some just get it: Those who know and love this book just get it...and this book will always have a special place in their hearts. Some won't...or will prefer the movies. If you truly love this book...try also the audio book...the unabridged version read by Rob Inglis. It is beautifully done.

1, Pretty amazing
1, LOTR RULES! Tolkien FOREVER!: Okay
0, Too hard to get into: I got this for my 14 yr old who is an avid reader. He didn't like it at all and I returned it through kindle. I am pleased they took the return because I got this and The Lord of the Rings so it would have been a waste of money!
1, Simply the Best: As it has been said a thousand times before... This is simply the best Adventure/Fantasy story ever written.Superb.
0," A piece of junk: The tape was worn out even though the seller said it was in ""GOOD"" condition"
0, horrible: These are the roughest sheets I have ever purchased. 1000 thread? more like 10!I returned them after trying to get them to soften up in the wash and they had to be ironed.
1, Happy to have a mouse again.: Very happy to find this book. I bought the first one 13 years ago and wanted my new grand-niece to enjoy it as much as my grandkids did. Only negative thing was that the mouse's tail was frayed. I corrected it my using a little Elmer's glue.So all is good.
0, 2 Pages of good advice squeezed into 200 pages of preaching.: I was severely disappointed in this book after reading the other reviews on this web site. I bought this as my first step towards considering adoption and after the first 10 pages or so
0, Constantly having to reprogram this remote: This remote worked fine when I first received it. However
0, Remote that didn't work: The remote worked for about a week and then stopped. I don't know if itwas my 2 TV's or the controller.
1, Excellent home inspection source for reference: I found the book well laid out with diagrams and explanations in laypersons terms. A must for those who want to do the job correctly and not depend on memory.

0," disappointing read: Leach offers a tourist snapshot of ""contemporary China"". His impressions lack substance and originality"
1, Insightful!: In Insurance from Underwriting to Derivaties
0," Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide: This is a book I would never purchase. If the editorial reviews by Maltin that are shown on this website are any indication of the book then I would say that Leonard Maltin is an over-rated windbag. It seems that any movie that is not ""Oscar material"" gets a proverbial thumbs down. Whatever happened to watching a fun movie for the sheer entertainment value. I pity him because it seems in the critic business that everyone is racing to put their seal of approval on the ""Oscar"" performances in order to prove their own legitimacy in the public eye. I think that he like other critics have become so involved with disecting a movie that they have forgotten how to just enjoy a movie for what it is. Yes"
0, Garbage: Maltin imitates most of his reviews from other critics. One thing bad about it is that he detests an amazing amount of movies
1, Good Bugs: very helpful book
0, Zzzzz: I realize this is a text book analyzing authors of international relations theory
1," One Sweet Holster: Bought one of these for my Taurus PT-92 and it fits like a GLOVE. Great design and rides perfectly. This one holster has two belt size options on it: both 2"" and 1.5"""
1, Excellent melodic hard rock album: Wow
1, Best Shoes I've Ever Owned: I can't say enough good things about these shoes. I bought a pair while browsing in Nordstroms about 6-7 years ago and they are absolutely the best shoes I've ever owned. Extremely comfortable and although they don't feel as good as they once did
0, A Dreadful Bore: I tried to get through this book. It took me about three weeks to get to page one hundred. The format was a mess. It was supposed to be the collected documents of the main character. This format just made reading the book a chore. After a while I found it difficult to keep the characters straight and just found myself dreading the idea of reading it. This could have been a good 400 page novel
0, Learning mode is not good: I bought this remote mainly as a learning remote to control a TV and DVR.I was hoping I could use the learn option to assign whatever codes I wanted to buttons on this remote. Unfortunately the learn option is not good
1, Track List: Consider Yourself Housed - various artists / Great Jones / 1989 /Track list:1} Izzy - Keep On Keepin' On (7:40)2} Bonz - I'm Housin (6:58)3} Passion - You Really Sound Good To Me (7:13)4} Boys Of Darkness - Near Midnight (8:03)
1, Great!: Great little microwave for the money! Perfect for those who only use the microwave to reheat food and want to conserve counter space.
1," Easy to read approach to meditation: I am so happy I bought Rosenberg's ""Breath by Breath""! Reading it has rekindled my determination to pursue this simple yet profound method of simply following the breath while sitting in meditation. But not only while sitting. ""Breath by Breath"" also talks about the value in walking meditation. Stuff we do all day long"
0, Not what I thought it would be: This book was not at all what I thought it would be. The title sounds like it should be a good resource for starting a well-stocked modern country retreat or something like a hunting cabin. In reality the book rambles on and on with anti-government rhetoric and theories
0, a big disappointment: My boyfriend surprised me with this lubricant for my birthday and it was nothing but a big disappointment. After 10 minutes there was still no warming sensation and I was left sticky and completely turned off. It was basically a waste of time and money.
0," Accused: Watch out if your ""man"" has a little ""burning"" rash on his thing...thinking YOU gave him something...then it dawned on us...it was that stuff!! Warms"
0, more of same: I have enjoyed this authors other books
0, Horrible Book: I had used this book for a Introductory Differential Equations class I took my Junior year and because of this book I had the worst time understanding the material in this class. The explanations are convoluted and lengthy
0, Good old-fashioned lesson in information control!: Shame
1, A Book that really teaches: Secrets of Screenplay Structure is the best book out there on screenwriting. It not only introduces you to the fundamentals
0, Charles Kuralt is a bore: Several months ago
1, At last
0, great if buttons hadnt stopped workign prorperlly after only 1 year of use: This remote was great at first. I have multiple devices and thus several remotes. This remote manages all of them with ease. There wasn't a device that had a remote that i couldn't control with the 720. however
1, Safe Harbor: I would have to say that this was my first lesbian book to ever pick up. It was a catcher for me from the begining. Radclyffe is an outstanding writer I have also enjoy the Shield of justic book. I would and I do recommend this writer to anyone.
1, Two characters you don't want to miss: I really enjoyed the two main characters. They have such integrity. They don't play games with each other. They have interesting lives and are confident in themselves.Don't miss this book.I read a portion of the story on the internet and liked it so much I wanted to read the complete tale in print. An excellent book to bring to the beach or on a plane or on your couch or ...Look for the newest edition published by Bold Strokes Books October 2004.This is a Keeper !Don't miss any of the books in this series -Safe HarborBeyond the BreakwaterDistant Shores

0, Good for hardcore Skinny Puppy fans: I like them quite a bit
0," You've got to be kidding me.: This record is awful. Why these other reviewers compare it with ""the old days"" and then mention Last Rights and Too Dark Park is beyond my comprehension. Those albums are NOT THE OLD DAYS of Skinny Puppy ANYWAY! Bites"
0, The vanguard becomes the rear-guard: The innovative techniques that made SKINNY PUPPY sound edgy and subversive twenty years ago now sound tired and lo-tech. Clearly
0, RIP Skinny Puppy!: This album sucks! But if you are a puppy fan
1, good: It is a real zippo. I love it
1, great lighter: Genuin zippo lighters are great and last really well along with being easy to use and constructed well.Zippo lighters come with a wick and flint already installed no matter what type you buy but no zippo will ever be pre filled as it is unsafe.The refill flints
0, Ehh..: I got this hoping it would be good. I only used it 3 times and it just stopped working and I don't know what to do.
0, Display zippo: I got a display zippo....covered in scratches from top to bottom front and back. 1 star gone.This of course means the lighter didnt click as sharply as a new one should
1," Phat TechHouse: This is a supperb collection of unmixed 12"" compiled by the lads at Hooj! Top techhouse producers like Rocket"
1, Good Coverage: I have been programming for over 3 years now
1, Disappointing ending: I absolutely love this series. It quickly became one of my favorites. The only bad thing about is that it didn't have a conclusive ending. It left alot of questions unanswered. Fingers crossed that one day they'll dub the rest.
1, Great book: This is a well written beginner book. It has repeating words and easy phonetic words. The story is very cute and funny. My kids

0, Who the hell likes Sondheim?: Thank god that this is
1, ...finally...the return of Vince!: I was quite surprise when I first bought this album that Vince decided to join back Motley Crue. I never thought this could happen again after so much bad blood between Vince and the rest of the Crue in the early 90s. But
0, Not good. Swine was written for Jon Corabi
0, A return to form but....: New Tatoo is a return to form for Motley Crue
0, What happened?: Back in the '80s when the heavy metal well was running dry it just seemed like the Crue was just your average glam band. They started out so strong with thier first two albums but then just seemed to fall into the category of ordinary. They finally broke out of that
0, the worst lp they could do: i cant believe this is a motley lp
0, Motley Bland: I bought the new Crue album last week and have to say that I am disappointed. I kept hearing how this would be their best effort since Dr. Feelgood. The problem

1, Awesome Book!: i bought this book as a gift for my sweetie who loves World War II tanks and I did not go wrong with this choice. The book is very large with photos of every tank/armored vehicle with specs. There are hours of reading that can be done with hours to spare. Not only that

1, Much better than the newer switches!: Once upon a time
1," A great reference tool on Japan: I purchased this book at great cost but it has been worthwhile. It provides a concise overview of Japanese culture. It is the only book I have found to be so informative without the ""fluff"" of other books. I don't know about this one but the one I purchased is of fantastic high quality paper that makes such a small book rather heavy. A great book for anybodies reference library."

Most consist of minimum ingredients and very easy to follow directions.I have used 5 recipes already and all turned out well to rave reviews.The most impressive recommendation I can give is that my 21 year old son made Crawfish Etoufee! It was delicious.......took only 20 minutes and.............MINIMAL cleanup.I think beginners

1, Merlin Rocks!: I missed half the first season of Merlin when it was on NBC. But I was hooked from the first show I watched. I can't believe that NBC is so stupid as to not pick it up for a second season - but haven't missed an episode since it was picked up by SyFi. I was happy to get the first season at a good price - BestBuy was $10 higher. Now I can watch the series anytime I want - even though the legend has been drastically changed for television.
1, Perfect.: Just as described. Perfect condition and arrived within the estimated time frame. Will shop again from this buyer. Very satisfied customer.
0, Don't bother using Arthurian names...: ... because the characters have nearly nothing to do with Arthurian legend. Yes

0, wrong one: dissapointed was not what i wanted was looking for newr version this was an older one so just wasn't happy
0," Colorization and Nelson commentary insulting to this classic: This film deserves better treatment. There is no reason the film should be colorized nor tainted by the insulting comedic commentary by Mike Nelson. ""L.S. of H."" may not be ""The Godfather"" but it certainly isn't ""Manos the Hands of Fate"" either. Avoid Legend Films releases."

0, Not worth your time or energy: I would have to say that this is the worst Steve Martin movie. We decided to watch this movie as a family
0, Disappointing: I had high expectations after reading all the other Amazon reviews
0, Poorly written and uninteresting characters...: After I got to the point where one character was pretending to strangle another character for about 5 pages where they kept jumping back and forth between the present and the past without giving much indication that they were doing so
0, Can't finish: The story is very interesting but the way it is written really put me off. The constant flashbacks is annoying because it unnecessarily intrudes on the story telling. All the characters aren't very interesting either. After reading Death of a Necromancer (similar book about a genius thief in a world full of rich
1, Worth a Try: This is an interestingly conceived world with believable characters--thus the four stars--but I didn't finish the book

0, Beautiful but Impractical: I cannot complain about the artwork in this calendar. It's inspirational. But the matter transport stream was obviously distorted on the way to the publisher. This calendar must be hung *SIDEWAYS* on the wall.It is the fault of the publisher and/or Amazon for not clarifying this. Also
0, Ships of the Line:2009 Wall Calendar: The images for the calendar are great but the double width makes it difficult to hang. It also posts unusual grids for each month which makes the days of the week difficult to read at a glance.
1," Has withstood the test of time.: I have been using this book with graduate students for more than 10 years. It is a deceptive book in its low cost and small size. It cannot be merely read; it must be experienced. Reflection about the key ideas illustrated by the exercises and how the reader can apply them to his or her life is also important. Adams incorporates theory and research as a basis for the ""hands-on"" experience. Some exercises do need to be up-dated (e.g."

1," Haunting!: This is one of Dick's early novels and one of his easiest reads. His handling of the cracks that gradually appear in his ""real"" world is simply beautiful and is great literature. This is a book that I have disposed of and then later bought again and reread several times. I recently bought the Japanese language edition to practice my Japanese with."
0, The over-the-hill Gang rides again: Seeing Goldie prance around like a five dollar hooker was very upsetting...I enjoyed the Geoffry Rush character and I think it would have been a better movie if the movie was more about him. Sarandon is a great actress and did her best to make the part work. But I could never get past the cartoon character that Goldie provided. She was in fact the heroine in the story. She understood children
1, Good book: This was a good
0, Please do not quit your day job Fanny!: With her first release being poor I am really surprised that she was given a 2nd chance. This CD is as horrible
1, Helped us plan the perfect honeymoon: This book helped us decide which islands to visit. It has all of the practial information to make these decisions. It helped us figure out where to stay. We took it with us on the trip. We looked at this several times a day. It was really the only book we needed. There was a great tip for the best picnic spot on the road to Hana. It was the most romantic afternoon we spent on Maui. This book is a must for anyone planning a trip to Hawaii. There is just too much to see and do.
1, Hawaii for Dummies: Very helpful and fun. Planning our first trip and everything we need seems to be there and easily understood and accessed.

My son had gotten a different kind for his house and liked mine so much that he bought one for his house. They don't take up a lot of space either!

1, The Turning Point of World War II: This book is narrative history at its best. It brings to life the horror or war and
1, Detailed history of the pivotal battle of World War II: A gripping and detailed history of the battle for Stalingrad in 1942-43. The book gives a good account for the reasons why the German high command and Hitler placed so much at stake in capturing the industrial city of Stalingrad in southern Russia in their 1942 campaign. The level of detail and research into what can only be described as a great human tragedy will be greatly appreciated by any reader wishing to learn more about the much misunderstood war between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany
1, Used item: i bought this book very cheap and as used. The book was in perfect condition like new. Very happy with everything.
1, I should be able to rate this album with more than 5 stars.: I should be allowed to use more than 5 stars to rate this album - one of the finest albums
0, Poor reproduction of a Wonderful Album: Do not buy.: I own the original Kind of Blue Album. This CD reproduction bites the big one. I got Borders bookstore to give me a full refund-A rarity. The original album is a classic.
0, Product malfunction: Right in the best part
1, This is the sound of falling in love: This is unquestionably the finest jazz recording I know of. Its emotion
1, Scary-good: Every time I listen to this CD I appreciate it more. It's an amazing work for even a fledgling jazz fan (such as myself). The style is approachable and exciting at the same time. If you don't own this CD at one point in your life
1, Best sounding version ever of this great album!: THE most interesting jazz sessions created by THE classic Miles lineup. This classic jazz album should be on every Top5 jazz album lists.What intrigues me most here is the fantastic sound of the SACD. I also have the previous gold CD version and a 70's repress LP
1, One of my favourite recordings: Tremendously influential on my musical life
0, Miles Daivs - A Poser With NO talent: I am sorry but this is WACK. Want some good jazz music? Listen to some 50 cent or Jessica Simpson and you hear REAL jazz on the masterpieces they made
1, Dreaming: I was working at the bookstore at the University of Pennsylvania when a coworker asked me if I liked jazz? I told him I didn't like elevator music!! Anyway
1, this album will change your life: This is the best jazz album ever. No questions. The music is extremely melodic and the playing is incredibly epic. The album is extremely easy to listen to with no exotic experimental stuff
1, This is where the bar is set.: I can think of no other recording that has thebeautiful feel of this start to finish. I reallylike lots of jazz recordings but this one is thevery best. These musicians conjured up magic inthe studio. Sublime was discovered.
1, The Genius of Miles Davis: To hear this 1959-recorded album today
1, The first Jazz album you should buy.: One of Miles' better bands. Though I miss Philly Jo Jones (early to late 50's Miles Davis quintet)
1, The best jazz CD ever?: This is the coolest
0, Disappointing: For a 3M product
0, Deadman's Canyon: This story is medicore compared to the hundreds of western books I have read. The story is very predictable.
1, Too Busy Not to Pray: Great book to give you reason to pray and encourage you to pray. It explains reason thoroughly and completely
1, Quality knob and durable finish.: It's a locking door knob. It looks nice but more importantly it was an exact match for the ones the builder installed in my new home. I only had to replace it because I locked myself out of the house and had to drill through it. I would happily buy it again but when I took it to the store to be re-keyed I purchased a few spares so (I hope) this won't happen again.
0, OLD product: 01-27-03:You can get the USB 2.0 version for 59.99 at CompUsa and many other places. So spending 62 bucks for the older slower technology is just silly. USB 2.0 is 10-40 times faster.

1, sorry I took so long: It took me to long to finally read this book. In my school I don't know when I was growing up we never read this book. Instead I selected it for our book club.I enjoyed reading this book finally. I used to hear this was a good read.Growing up story
1, School Assignments Never Touched Me This Much!: When I heard that we were going to to be reading To Kill A Mockingbird for our next book
1, To kill a mockingibrd: To kill a mocking bird was a good book because it taught you some new lessons and it showed you the troubles of being racist and it shows you other ways to avoid it.It also has other many good lessons to it and its an exciting book for many kids of any age.Well in conclusion i think people should buy the book and read it.
0, An American classic????: I waited 52 years to read this book. I should have waited 52 more. A real snoozefest. I don't see what all the fuss is about.
1," Good story - a learning experience: It's amazing to read a story like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and see how ""good white people"" treated negros"". No wonder there were race riots and protests. It seemed like I was reading about a different country"
1, It's a classic for a reason...: I first read this book in high school
1, mockingbird is a classic: Harper Lee writes this book and the way she wrote this book was real nice. The setting of this book happened around the 1930's when blacks are still discriminated.This book starts with a girl name Scout telling her story about her summer days in a small town called Maycomb. She acted more like a boy but the way she acts she is more mature compare to the kids with the same age. So this story she tells has two important parts
1, A Classic For All To Read: There are few books that comes along that will make you sit down and examine the way you look and fell about people in society
1, 1372 reviews and counting: I read this when it first was published and many times since. The story is timeless. The themes are as current as the day they were written.Three scenes stand out: Atticus shooting the rabid dog

0, I just don't see what all the fuss is about: I found this book to be dull
1, Great!: I first got this book for my Literature and i got feedback from my Aunts and my mum. And they all said stuff like it was a really boring book. So i read it for myself and guess what! I actually found it GREAT! I recommend this book for all those who love Literature and reading. It contains good Vocabulary and this would be a great help to those who lack it.

1, To Kill a Mockingbird: I think Harper Lee's novel was a warm and pure piece of American literature. The last two chapters really affected me the most
1, How can you give this book less than 5 stars???: The majority of the people that did not like this book can't even spell
1, One of the Best Assidned Books I've Read: I've just begun to read this book. I was assigned it for English class. Usually
0, a minority view?: TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the most overrated and hyped books of our time. It's an uneven paste-job of short stories and pieces by Harper Lee promoted by her liberal New York publishing friends.Some sections are absurd
0, Doesn't even deserve the one star...: Although the author had some good points
1, Starts Slow But All in All Great: The beginning of the book disappointed me a little
0, Respected: This book was very boring at first
0, This book is very prejudice.: I really do not recommend this book to anybody because the whole book is based on prejudice and it centers around a principle that is not correct or appropriate. This is a required book for ninth graders and I think that it is ridiculous that they should be required to read this book because they are learning about Black prejudice and it is as though no one wants to acknowledge White prejudice at all. There are words that are offensive to Black people yet nothing negative is even thought about White people.
0," Misleading Product Description: This product's description misleads one to expect a higher quality paper and binding than received. This is a ""pocketbook"" with high-acid paper and glue binding"
1, So Glad I Read It: My mother forced me to read this book
1, Required Reading: This is truly one of the best novels ever written
0, A zero out of five: I'm sorry everyone. I don't see why this book is so fabeulos. I would give it a zero. I find no point in writing a book about segregation
0, MOCKINGBIRD EXPOSE: As a teenager
0, Pretty boring: Pretty darn boring
0, A hopeful theme: If you like a slow calm plot but a great moral I highly reccomend this book. It is very slow
1," It's A Sin to not read ""To Kill A Mockingbird""...: ...well"
1," A beautiful book: This is a really beautiful copy of an all-time favorite. It's a good gift for someone who has already read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and loved it."
1, Best ever audio book: I just finished listening to this yesterday in my car. Sissy Spacek is a wonderful reader. To have her read ANYTHING to me in my car is a priceless treasure
1, Great Book: I was fortunate enough to read To Kill a Mockingbird when I was in 9th grade. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The book is absolutely amazing
1, Praise For Book and Movie: What can be said about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said much better than I could. I don't rate many books as five stars and after thinking about what my criteria would be
1, Classic: This is a book set in a bygone era
1, Book report on To Kill A Mockingbird: A most thought provoking and relevent theme
0, horrible condition!: I got this book to read for a class assighnment. i love the book as in the story but the pages had been like riped apart from the others and were very frayed. they were cut crocked and shreaded at the viewable ends. it was very dissapointing to recieve a very good story in a horrifying package. i would reccomend this book but not from this page. i would go purchase it from a store so you know what condation it is in. i would expect better from a 50th anaversy edition. p.s excuse my spelling please. i don't take time to correct my mistakes
1, One of the best books ever written: This book is by far the best one ever written. Taking place during the GreatDepression
1, A great book!: This is a book that everyone should read! It's really moving and might even teach younger kids lessons about people who are only different by the color of their skin.
1, A classic in every sense: This book is simple enough stylistically for a child to read and enjoy
0, Nasty book: This book is very nasty. It depicts scenes I would not care to see if I was being PAID. It's just a sick book. Dont read it
1, A great classic book with a great storyline: I had read this book in high school and had forgotten how great a book this was. This book has so much in the story that makes you think and alot of it makes you relate to real life.The character's in story reach out to you in way that makes you feel like you are in there world. Scout was one of my favorite charactors the way she was through the book. My other favorite charactor is Jem. I love how both of the kids were afraid of so much but from there fear they learned so much. I also love how they stood by people in the story.Overall I forgot just how good this classic novel this was and I wish Harper Lee had written more books.
0, To Kill a Mockingbird: The copy I received was filled with hand written notes throughout the text. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
1," Every one should have a father like Atticus: All the reviewers who gave this movie less than 3 stars said they had to read it for English or said they ""Made us read it for English"". When will these people learn"
1, A beautiful masterpiece!: This book is SO AMAZING! It's a flawless piece of work. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Atticus is the model adult
0, Do not waste your money.: The book is a pathetic collection of cuts and pastes
0, DON'T Do IT!!!!!!!!!: A complete waste of $10!!!!! IDK what the author's swimming background was
0, Bizarre: My husband tried this book first
1, Words cannot begin to describe the greatness!!!: Damien's is absolutely amazing. He can do no wrong!!! I haven't heard a song I didn't love! From the covers he's done at concerts to the B-sides collected here the music is just beyond words. It had been so long since I heard true talent in a musician that I begun to think I would just have to live in the past but then Damien came along and with Lisa
1, Amazon Price is extremely high: Nice unit. It is available at your local WalMart for $17.96. You do pay sales tax
1, Fry Daddy: Glad to have purchased the product. It's just the right size for the two of us. Heats quickly and maintains temp
1, The best and easiest!!!: I got this fry daddy for my mother...she just remodeled her kitchen and she has always used a fry daddy. The last one she had worked for her for more than 15 years...she swears by it. It the easiest thing to work
0, It works
1, Working fine: I bought this to fry fish through the year. So far I've used it once a week (I've had it for about 2 months)
1, Good product: Does exactly what it says it will do. Nice size for doing relatively small amount of frying.
1, A nice fryer for the price: This is a good fryer and it worked well the few times we used it. We wound up getting rid of it because we found it difficult to store because we did not use it on a daily or even weekly basis. So we had to change the oils which got expensive and again
0, Does not heat up properly: Use the product within the 30days from when Amazon delivers because I did not and when I finally used it about 45 days after I got it
1, Just what I wanted: This little fryer is awesome. We have fried up about 25lbs of fish so far. Cleans easy and is just the right size for storage.
1, Good deep fryer: I like this product because it is compact enough to fry enough food for a single person or a couple at once. Very little oil is used and the food come out crisp and moist on the inside.My four children have used mine so much and love it they are each getting one for Christmas.
1, Great for 2 People: This product is great for the occasional snack
1, Fits in the cabinet: Love this little fryer. It actually holds a lot of food. It heats up quickly and fits perfectly on a shelf in my cabinet.
1, The Best Beau Brummel: One of Stewart Granger's classic movies. This is the way all movies should be. The good ole days of fancy costume movies are long gone.
1, Apollo 13:To the Edge and Back-Accurate and Great!: Apollo 13:To the Edge and Back-Accurate and Great! I suggest buying this documentary and Apollo 13 IMAX to cover all bases on this important historical event. This documentary will provide all the facts you need to know about this mission in order to check out the accuracy of the Ron Howard and Tom Hanks film.
1, Not what I expected: I had passed over this movie several times in the video store
0," Terrible experience: This product will not install on Mac OSX version 10.6.x. This is the response from IMSI:""TurboCAD Mac v1.1 has not been tested or is supported on the operating system Leopard 10.6.x. The newly release version of TurboCAD Mac v5 is Snow Leopard compatible"
0, Pathetic: Would have been great if this item was the item I had received...But I did not get the item in this picture. Instead what I got was old
0, not what i expected: I returned this item and are awaiting my credit. the book i did not use at all. found better materail
1, Great Textbook: I bought this book used but it is brand new! It looks like it has never even been read. I'm so happy and it's such a great deal!!!
0, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME: I would never buy this album
0, Bought 2 - 2 Went bad due to weak design & QA: Bought twoTwo went bad within a yearFirst one had trouble copy & paste (would erratically pick up only partial click and drag)Second oneAfter 40 seconds of operation
0, Great Design
0, A Dictionary Should Not be Biased!!!: The hallmark of a good dictionary is fairness to all schools of economics
0, Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought: Sir:I did purchase the same day this book by Lukacs together with the book by David Romer Advanced Macroeconomics. However
1, Willie Dynamite ..YOU GOTTA HAVE VISION!: This dvds existance has been a long time coming. I knocked on alot of doors asking
0, I love Shania
1, Shania Twain surely went UP! in popularity: This CD is full of excellent music from the first song to the last. I paticulary liked the country disc though the pop disc was great as well. This gives you choose what type of music you like. Whether you like country or pop or a mix of both this Cd is a great A+! My favorite songs were Up!
0, Save Your Money!: ...I can't believe that it took her five years to come up with this pile of garbage. The music is nothing but a bunch of pre-programmed keyboards. The lyrics are so simple minded
0, This CD Sux!!!!!!!!!!!: What has happened to Shania Twain? Her past works were soooooooo good and this one is so awful!I tried the old keep listening it will grow on you approach;it didn't! It merely got on my nerves even more!The Cd is way over-produced the vocals grating and the music blaring.I listened with dismay as I realised the real Shania was gone and now she was a mindless Mutt Lange fabrication.Take my advice and don't spend your hard earned money on this partially worthless piece of crap. I've already sold my copy!For something tender
1, My all time favorite courtry artist!: As a kid I hated courtry
0, Too Bad Shania
1, Amazing!: The best Shania's work. The international edition offers pop and remix versions. Great!!...
1, I had to get two copies of this CD!! LOL: This CD is awesome
1, In all honesty...: as a non country fan
0, Nothing new here: It amazes me that people consider Shania a great singer. Good maybe - great no. However
1," This CD Rocks!: This CD is a great follow up to her last album ""Come On Over"". The music on this CD is very catchy and speaks to everyone. There are two CD's in this package"
1, Slightly disappointing
1, MasterPiece: Personally I think this CD is PERFECT! I mean a pop
1, A nice companion piece to OF MICE AND MAGIC: Barrier's book meticulously traces the rise and fall of the medium sarting in its infancy and taking us up to the present... there are many gaps along the way; he obviously had access to practically everything in the Disney archives and has a fondness for the Warner Brothers' shorts
0, C'mon
1," Great: Sheryl Crow has not disappointed me yet. She seems to get better and better on each release. This cd is a more upbeat cd than ""The Globe Sessions"" and has many guest star appearances by the likes of Lenny Kravitz"
0, She get's a ZERO: I am not impressed at all with her last few works of embarrassment. I hope she retires soon. She's a home wrecker and a bad example to the human race.
0," A Stevie Nicks wannabee: Sheryl Crow has no real talent- what she is good at iscreating songs from other artists. I think she probalyspent alot of time listening to Stevie Nicks music andcopied her sound. She is such a no talent. You listen toher music and then say why did I buy this. I have re soldall of my Sheryl Crow CD's because you want to buy thembut after a few listens you hate them. I will give her creditfor ripping off Stevie Nicks style. She could'nt be originalif she tried. She is all hype--why does everyone want her ontheir CD's. She did do one good thing-produce Stevie Nicks""Trouble IN Shangrila"" CD- but then she pretended she wasStevie. C'mon C' mon is her worst CD. It is terrible and fromthe looks of her recent sales she will soon be a has been.Sheryl you made alot of money ripping off Stevie Nicks"
0," go away sheryl crow! and never come back!: i think sheryl crow should retire now that she is worried about her being middle-aged. none of the songs are worth a penny on here but ""Weather Channel"". It's a fairly decent song. Anyways"
0, No Good: I bought this album for the song
0, Poor Sheryl: I am sorry but this album was awful. I was and still am in love with Tuesday Night Music Club
0," What a dog...: I must confess I have not listened to this album -- nor will I. One time through ""Soak up the Sun"" on the radio was all I needed to hear. What an insipid and annoying song. I can't believe a professional"
0, Mediocre: This is my least favorite Sheryl Crow album. She did too many collaborations and lost her sound. Steve McQueen and the Weather Channel sound like Crow
1, This CD Rocks!: C'mon C'mon is fantastic! If your a longtime Sheryl fan
1, Different from the newer blinker albums..: This album is a lot more rock than the newer blinker the star albums. It has hints of nirvana in many of the songs. Kind of a later grunge album I guess. The lyrics are a little wierd (they don't really make alot of sense)
0, Not a durable toy!: I echo what another reviewer wrote. I have two boys who needed this toy as part of their occupational therapy. The frames are just not durbale and bent up in no time
1, Invaluable and Timeless: I have read this book twice. Once because the subject matter interests me
0, It was okay: Really the story had potential. Unfortunately it never reached it. Most of the scenarios are just plain ridiculous. Especially the leads and their interaction about divorce and all that. And more so with the villain. I mean
1, Ahhh
1, SADE: Lovers Rock: What can I say...this woman is absolutely incredible! If you ever get a chance to see her live
0, lovers rock/sade: glad i had chance to hear two/threetracks before buying
0, Lover's Rock Does NOT Rock...: This is the first Sade album I ever bought. I enjoyed all of the 20-something songs that were and still are being played on jazz stations today
1, Lovers Rock (Sade): I bought this album recently and am really enjoying it very much. All of the songs are amazing. her voice is perfect and the melodies are wonderful. My favorites are By Your Side
0, lover's rock: Am i the only one that is disturbed by the annoying guitar fret changing noise??>?I can't seem to hear anything else.Pass on this one. Sade should be embarrassed at the poor recording quality!!
0, Disappointing: I know I'm the odd one out but I'm comparing this to 'Diamond Life' which if you don't know Sade
1," Lovers Rock: I could not stop playing Sade's new song ""Lovers Rock"" over again and again. Her voice just touches my soul softly and deeply. I remember my husband and I danced in Sade's music in our fist date several years ago. Now we are married and live happily... After years"
1, Sade: This cd is great to sit and relax and maybe do some light reading. It also sets the mood when you and your significant other want to heat things up! Very Enjoyable!
0, Where Is The Band ?: I've always been a huge Sade fan. Her incredibly smooth voice was always perfectly complimented by musicians who played their instruments just as smooth. This Album contains mediocre guitar playing along with popular electronic sound effects that lack emotion. Plus
0, Choppy & uneven sound - not even close to her other work: I actually had to recheck my cd to make sure I had the same one as eveyone reviewed here - personally
1, AT LAST!!!!!: I held by breath for eight years and finally I can exhale. I consider this CD to be a platinum effort by Sade and a welcome relief from other disappointing R&B offerings out there. This CD rocks with sparse albeit deep lyrics
0, slightly frozen comeback of Sade: After listening this album I am a bit disappointed by the come-back of Sade. Especially the music doesn't approach the intimite atmosphere and smoothness from earlier albums from both Sade and Sweetback. This album comes to me like a pretty cold winter...
0, Mysticism: No table of contents...no chapter headings...just 500 pages of text. It's a superb book- pick another edition.
1, Great little reference book
0, WARNING: This CD will not fit into some players: I love FF and was excited to listen to this CD. The format of it is a Dual Disc CD/DVD therefore it is thicker and will not fit in some players. There is a *very* small warning about this on the back and is something most people won't notice
0, The CD OK but do not buy the dual disc: Being a Franz Ferdinand enthusiast I agree with the previous reviews as to the musical content of this recording. However Amazon does not alert that the DVD side of the dual disc is Zone 1 and cannot be reproduced in other zones. I bought the Dual Disc of the Ferdinanz recording as I wanted to listen to the enhanced high resolution multichannel version
0, Detached competence pervades: 2 1/2Typical sophomore from the type of indie group unable to deliver on any over-hyped promise to begin with
0, Stylized Flop: I first listened to Franz Ferdinand looking for another band to add to my music collection and found wonderful bass lines and funky guitar with a unique style that was actually worth listening to. The first album was perfect other than the band's decision on what to release as a single
0, perfect example of what is wrong with commercial rock music today: When major music publications such as Rolling Stone
0, Simple/Common items missing...: One thing that is pretty much common to every business is buying in one quantity say by the case
1, Perfect!!!: The window regulator with motor was a perfect fit. Installation was straight forward and easy. The packaging also included replacement panel clips incase you broke some while removing the door panel!
0, Kindle pricing: I'm always stunned that the pricing for a Kindle copy is more than a new paperback copy of any title in Amazon. No production cost
0, Drowning in the Cruel Sea: This classic story was totally ruined by a computer generated voice. We listened to this travelling interstate
1, The Cruel Sea: A very real story. Brings the reality of war at sea to life. A classic read for people that enjoy stories about the sea
1, Satire and humor by the wizard of words.: How does John Mortimer do it? Everything I read by him is so consistent
1, Excellent Conclusion to a great series: It's a shame that this series is out of print. I had to get mine off eBay for nearly $40.00! Now I know why. Though the series is written by different authors
0, Don't You Believe It!: Good old Amazon touts 2-3 days to ship this item I ordered on 09/20/03. B.S.!Received email requesting a delay in shipment until late October.Whatever happened to inventory control?Books at Amazon
1," NASA calling: ""We can't hear our Space Shuttle over your teakettle""!: I bought this as a replacement to my Bodum that had a base meltdown.I would have given it 5 stars because of design"
1, toasty: its important to note that this unit does not have electric start. this one you have to light with a match/lighter. that being said
0, Should Have Listened to Other Reviews!: Even though I read a review saying this product didn't work I bought it anyway because I needed it for job interviews. Well I ended up returning them. I have a BRAND NEW burner and CD ROM. These CD's are not recognized by either. The burn fails everytime and the CD ROM just spins the CD
1, great collection of amazing works: Wolff is an amazing writer. He says more in these short stories than other writers say in entire books. I heard Bullet in the Brain on This American Life and I had to buy the book. I am so glad that I did. Kids will be studying these someday in school.
0, It takes time to learn this software!: If you dont' know anything about accouting
1, One of a kind!: I bought this radio for nostalgic reasons and as a replacement for the Galaxy 2100 I used to have. It has 40 channels + 80 ssb channels but it has all the bells and whistles and performance and HEADROOM that I'm familiar with owning a Galaxy radio. When you talk on this radio
1, Worth the admission: If you're like me
1, Glad to finally see a Pakistani women speak out: I commend Tehmina Durrani for having the courage to write this book. I hope she continues her writing career and I look forward to reading more of her writings.
0, nothing stirs up hate like calling people nazis: authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world.this stuff would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. The left cries about McCarthism but is doing the exact same thing here by creating villians and devils where there are none.Peddeling hate and fear even if based on loose facts or lies works for some.
0, It's good for kids.....: .....but I'm not a kid. From an adult viewpoint
0, This book is dated and boreing!: If you arn'd a hige fan of judy blume
0, Horrible...: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When you see Pacino
0, good acting but: good acting and kind of engaging but 2 hours of listening to people's pain - guys who are lying - who hate their job - is not my idea of entertainment.
1, One of the greatest movies ever made!: If you have been lucky enough to have seen this film then you know what I am talking about. If not buy or rent it
1, First Prize: A Cadillac
1, I've seen it a thousand times -- literally!: And I am a person who can rarely watch a movie twice. My friends and I can quote exact lines from the movie at the slightest prompting. The dialogue is at once intensely heart wrenching and side splittingly hilarious. Also
1, Rugged: The story of Mindy Lewis' experience in a mental ward. Rugged: She did not have an easy time of it
1, A Masterpiece: I have been listening to this album all the way through repeatedly since I bought it. That in it's own is an amazing feat anymore. I'd like to point out that you get even more in the package than is mentioned
0, I'm A Cold Fan
0, Is this Cold?: I have been a big supporter of Cold
1, I like it: This is a preey decent album from cold. It was not what I expected but it a great surprise.
1, Great CD-R Product! A Must Have!: Wonderful for saving data and burning games or cd's. Nice spindle bundle to hold the cd's in so they don't get cracked
0, Boring
0, Useless book: This book is useless. Please don't waste time on this book. It doesn't give you any new knowledge.
1, Emergency: This Book is great if you are studying to become an EMT-B cause this book is very good and very good at explaning the basics of become an EMT i think some of the picture are graphic but very well done and i think you will pass using this book
0, who in the world produced this cd? and why?: Listen man
1, Great Movie: I have viewed this movie three or four times and every time it is such a pleasure to have the movie in my Library of great movies.
1, Great transfer
1, Beautiful: Well made suspense romance story starring Bogie and Bacall. They are so good together...Also see The Big Sleep. Hawks was a genius.
1, Bogie an Bacall.. simply magic: I've been keeping my eye on this collection for a while. I figured now was as good a time as any to purchase some of the best chemistry portrayed on film... Bogie and Bacall- good stuff ;)
0, too many examples: I was confused by the many examples. Most of the times I did not see how they fit together in the theory. Perhaps I would have appreciate it more
1, A Great Album that Grows on You: Being a big Jane's fan
1, all is forgiven: this is the best vocal rendition of Ave Maria that I have ever heard.Absolutely beautiful!I have been playing the entire alblum alot and find it spirituallyuplifting.
1, Won't play on DVD player from Canada: Won't play on DVD player from Canada. Had to play it on my computer. Excellent in every other category. Would like to get one which would play on my DVD player. Regional code thing is a bummer.
1, Toto flush handle slightly off: A part of the metal casting on the Toto flush handle had broken
1, TOTO THU068-CP Trip Lever For St743S
0, THU068#CP Trip Lever: What a disappointment. I bought this through a plumber (way expensive as it turns out)
1, Homemade Sin: I like light entertainment without a mind boggling story line. The characters in this series are easily followed
1," remastering is not a positive: This is a great collection of songs by The Smiths - but the remastering has ruined the best aspects of the original recordings. For example ""Hand In Glove"""
1, Best Smiths compilation to date!: I am surprised to see so many comments on this release that are not on the positive side. This is the best compilation of the Smiths out there
1, Anyone for a game of cricket?: This CD is particular in the fact that I Roy's voice has been recorded on one track and the dubs on another.Therefore we haven't got real stereo as we know it but I Roy's voice coming out of one speaker and the backing track from the other. Apart from this
0, Buyer Beware: I bought this ski mask for my husband to wear on his way to work on his scooter. When it arrived I was very unhappy to see a sticker on it warning that it contains lead
1, Hat: Good product just what I thought it would be keeps my face warm. Material is nice
1, Finally the real deal: I don't buy cds because generally there are only one or two really solid songs on them. I heard this song from John Eddie on the radio when I was in San Diego and I loved it
1, I could not put it down!!: I read this book in one night. I loved it! This is the firstnovel I have ever finished cover to cover without being bored todeath. I am now reading Between Friends and enjoying it as well.
0, Thought It Was Just Me: I thought I was the only one who saw the ludicrousness of the story line between the sister sleeping with the boyfriend and the tart way they interacted. Red flags should have been raised with Leah
1," Dramatic Read: I am an avid reader of biracial romance novels. Ms.Kittgive you the ""411"" on interracial relationships. This is a goodread. I loved Leah. She had a lot of issues to deal with----a silly sister and a stupid boyfriend. Jason was a tough as nails type of guy. He had to battle with the loss of his son and with the stupid bigots on his job. Inspite of all Jason and Leah had to go through"
1, Beautiful!!1: This cd is briliace in my opinion
1, My 2 and 4 year old LOVE this!: My 2 year old is obsessed with the story of The Three Little Pigs. I got him this movie as a B'day present and he and my 4 year old love watching it. The several short cartoons hold my boys' attention much better than one full length movie. None of the content is scary and aside from the Big Bad Wolf saying that one of the pigs looks stupid
1, Excellent Infantry Tactics History Book: Great book that outlines the history and evolution of infantry tactics dating back to the times of the Civil War. Great for any military member interested in going into Infantry or just a history buff to see how things changed over the years.
1, A book that will grab you in the first few pages: The story of two
1, Good
0, another WTF movie: this was yet another example of how an excellent series could go terribly wrong. how many ways can i describe how bad this movie is? the acting is horrible. it was like watching a soap opera actress do horror when nothing scary was happening. the drama didn't have nearly the same effect of even the third omen.i just couldn't figure out why anyone would want to release this after the story had already been finished in the third omen. i have to agree with just about everyone who reviewed this. i couldn't believe they were all right
1, Excellent novel; shame about Tanis.: I feel a little cheated by what the authors do with Tanis in the latter half of this novel. Though not my favorite character
1, A book worthy of the DragonLance Saga!: In this
1, WOW: Everyone needs a teacher like Torey. Read this book you won't regret it. It's sooo good. It made me cry and laugh all at the same time. Books that do that are the best.
1, Heart Warming Story: I liked this book. It was good
0, Too hard to open
0, Not What I Expected.: In a sense
0, Beautiful? No. Revolting? Yes.: I was really looking forward to reading this book. The back cover made it sound like a wonderful tale with an interesting perspective. Well
0, A Most Overrated Book that took Ridiculuous Liberties: The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit this so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.It is also a stereotype to say that only a fundamentalist would object to this book.That is pure ignorance just as the author displayed when writing a very mediocre story. Of what revelance is it if someone sends money in to Pat Robinson when the book is the subject of opinion here?
0, Anti-feminist
0, A horrid misrepresentation of the Bible: First of all
0, A Well written fiction that completely breaks from the Bible: One cannot deny that Diamant is a gifted writer. I agree with another reviewer who compared this book with Zimmer Bradly's The Mists of Avalon (complete with the goddess worship
1," The Red Tent - Celebrating Sisterhood: I read The Red Tent recently while on vacation with my sisters and their families. I found it interesting as I read the book that I realized much of the traditions and ""sisterhood"" of biblical time still exists in my family. We took turns caring for the children"
1, Good book second time around: I recently re-read this book for a book club. Last time I had read it was probably 10 years ago. I felt it stood the test of time and I enjoyed it more this time than last probably because my knowledge about the bible was stronger this time around.
1, Thumbs up for biblical feminism!: Anita Diamamt has opened up a whole new world with this
0, Sick and twisted: Because so many others have already done so
0, Don't be fooled into thinking it's a Christian book...: I really regret reading this. Why on earth was it in the religion section of the bookstore? It should have been shelved with the occult books. It reads like it was written by an atheist
0, Not worth reading: Although this book has been highly touted
1, magical perspective: I enjoyed this book from the start. This made the old testament seem new and fresh to me.
1, Excellent look at biblical times: Being a biblical scholar myself
1, Much better than anticipated: When I picked this up for my book club
0," Neo-paganism inserted into an Old Testament Story: Not a surprise that one reviewer compared this book to ""Mists of Avalon"" -- both books insert contemporary neo-pagan beliefs and sensabilities into stories set in earlier times"
0, The Red Tent Beware Full of Bible untruths: I was extremely dissapointed with this book. It could have been great except for the unbeleivable amounts of untruths and downright lies concerning Biblical truth. They were totally unneccessary. The author took it upon herself to rewrite scripture. Very dangerous! The book could have been plenty interesting without them. Dont believe everything she writes as gospel because it is NOT. Also there are some very gruesome chapters that if true would be history but instead are only fictional. Too many people unknowingly think this book is biblical fact when it isnt at all.
0, An entertaining blasphemy: With all of the fundamentalist hand wringing surrounding Harry Potter(undeserved)
0, If you are a strong Christian this is not the book for you: I picked up this book expecting to read something that would enhance my faith and understanding of the Bible; however
0, A good story but disappointing: This story was interesting in it's historical value
0, Disgusting SMUT!!: Although this book is interesting in a historical context
0, Not what I expected: I picked up this book
0, Periods during the Biblical Period: If you love to read about the woman's cycle -- this book is for you! If you like to read a Biblical story twisted beyond recognition -- you'll also love this book.Although the author is a talented writer
1, I forgot I was reading...: This book was fantastic. The way in which this book was written it's hard to believe that the author wasn't there to see the actual events transpire. She writes with amazing detail
0, Not telling the truth: I read The Red Tent at the recommendation of friends. I will not recommend it to anyone else. Although the beginning started out well
0, Red Tent Bleeds with distortions: I thought this was one of the worst books ever written. It has so much historical distortions that fit neatly into a radical feministic viewpoint of the biblical times. This book demonizes males of the biblical times. Furthermore
1, The Red Tent: It is so valuable to have friends and family who will stick with you through the hard times. It was great to read about the sanctuary these women felt. A safe harbor in the midst of their storms and crises. This was great reading
1, Will renew your interest in biblical times!: I was engrossed in this novel from the first page. This is a heart-wrenching story but you will love every second of it. I could not put this down. When I was done reading it
1," I Am Woman! (BC Style): Diamant's ""Red Tent"" is a piece a well-crafted historical fiction based upon the Biblical tale of the only surviving daughter of Exodus' most fertile patriach and polygamist"
0, Why? Why make Jews hated even in biblical times?: Even though there are more then 1000 reviews of this book
1, I love this book: I loved this book and never wanted it to end. The story of relationships between strong women
1, Soup for the Pagan Soul: This book was absolutely the most wonderful book ever written. I think Ms. Diamante should re-write the ENTIRE BIBLE ! Dinah's story was magnificent
1, A Winner!: I really enjoyed reading this book. It has a great story
1, A worthwhile read: This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Diamant's female characters are fully realized
0, Disappointing: I could only read 40 pages of this book. It started out to be interesting
0, A woman's point of view is not enough: Just because the Old Testament is rarely approached from a woman's point of view does not
1, Wonderful!: I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women. We are a certain way with each other today
1, Thought Provoking: I thought that this book was thought provoking while showing me the way life might have been in ancient times.I found it interesting that the people of those times had such a great sisterhood. I for one could never share the man I love with a sister or a friend. I find they must have been such giving women to share one man. I found Jacob to be self absorbed and thoughtless about those he should have cherished.
0, ABSOLUTELY NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION: I was loving this book almost all the way through until
0, blasphemy: this is a boring 
1, This is a great book: I must preface this by saying that I am not religious - but I loved this book. I really enjoyed the story it was telling. To me this is more a story about where we come from as women
1, Great Read!: I found this book in the library and picked it up on a whim. I started to read and was blown away by the rich texture of the story.The premiss of the book fascinated me; tidea of reading about women who lived during Old testament time was excitig and new; the details of the period added rich color and life to these well known characters.I loved the book and am sad there was not more to hear from Dinah or the author. For similar premises I recomend works by India Edgehill.please visit me at BookDevour.blogspot.com
1, A Terrrific Read: This book is a story of Dinah
0, Perfect for Mills and Boon: A vacuous hypothesis based on Biblical times. The book is without any real story
1, An excellent introduction to Benedictine spirituality.: Initially I was put off from the book until I realized that it contains not a straight narrative bu a series of meditations by the author of how an introduction to St. Benedict and his monastic rule helped her in her faith. It is a book to read slowly and reread.
0, the real mccoy?: i spent a year studying in china alongside tibetan college students and travelling in and out of tibet itself. in the minds of many of my tibetan friends
1, Extra scenes!: This DVD has two serious advantages over the VHS version--first off
1, Good adaptation of the book: This DVD has the entire miniseries of Our Mutual Friend. It is a bit dark and chilling as it tells of the deplorable conditions of those living along the Thames in London of Dickens' time and of unusual happenings such as a dust (or garbage) man inheriting great a fortune and then mysteriously dying. It is so interesting it will make you curious to read the book if you haven't done so already. There is a brief overview of the book and its times at the end of the program
1, Yolanda Joe - Queen of the Metaphor: If there ever was a story that was difficult for me to put down Hatwearer'd Lesson was it; Yolanda Joe's writing made me feel great; and unable to put the book down until I reached the end. She uses metaphors like no one I've ever read before. Her characters could step right off the pages and be people I'd love to meet. A love story with real people (maybe). Congradulations
0, HATE BOOK with NEGATIVE 1 million stars: This is a book full of venom and hatred - not significantly different from reading Joseph Goebbels or Hitler(or Noam Chomsky for that matter). Books like this incite events like September 11
0, RUSTED - Do Not Buy: This silverware was fine until the knives all developed significant rust spots when they came out of the dishwasher after two months of ordinary use. The return window is ONE month. Do not waste your money on this set of utensils - there's nothing 'stainless steel' about them and Amazon will not help you. I'm not about to let my family ingest rust so these are useless. What a rip-off.
1, Folds away into my closet
1, Now I want one too!: I bought this for our 16 year old who is dabbling a bit in sewing
1, i want a ride in a seaplane after reading this: i love folletts way of bringing together history and a story. this one needs a bit more history and a bit less fluff
1, Useful and beautiful: This book reads like an essential afterword to the great video series. The chapters on mythologies of love
0, Footlocker sent me a black boot instead of the Burgundy boot: What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product? I would have wanted to know if they didn't have the color they showed in the picture
1, Funny Funny Funny: If you love Tas read this book because this is Tas at his finest! Its about how Tas meets Flint. Do I really have to say much more? LOL You will be laughing through this whole book. I personally love Tas to death so I had to buy this book. My bf and I both read this book and really enjoyed it.
1," surprisingly...good: one of Mary Kirchoff's ""better"" works. Not being much of a Burrfoot fan "
0, Worst Doctor Who ever!: The Dalek hold a trial aginst the Master... If you a Doctor Who fan
0, Very disappointing: After becoming a Doctor Who fan while watching the BBCs new TV series starting back in '06
1, Love it!!!: got it early and it is just as described we love Dr.Who so very happy to add this to our collection.
1, Khaki Ultra Force Boonie Hat: Beautiful hat
1, A better Daddy than a Father!: I bought this book for my Son who is a new Father of a baby girl. I thought the pages were insightfuland I hope he will read it again often. If he finds just one word that fives him hope for this upcoming rollercoaster ride called parent hood that he is on I will be beyond thrilled for them both.
0, basic instructions: I was disappointed with this book for several reasons. I bought this book because I have a one year old daughter and was searching for some insight on how to better bond with her as she ages. This book gave basic instructions that even a teenage parent would know
1, Mr. Grusin delivers smooth Jazz sounds!: great contemporary smooth jazz sounds .. he knows how to interpet jazz notes .. smooth .. soulful .. add this one to your jazz collection!! .. erika
0, Way too out of date: This was probably a good book in 1975
1," Annabelle's Wish Is A Classic In Our Home: This is just the best ""cartoon"" Christmas movie ever. And what a great message it gives us through Annabelle the cow. Annabelle teaches us by example that it is better to give than to receive. Her best friend is a little boy who is now mute because of his fear in a barn fire some time in the past. The boy has few friends"
0, Cursory explanations and poorly organized: I was required to use this book for a class
1, Not disappointed with this one!: Recently received my copy of the Southern Cook's Handbook
0, What a lousy piece of software!: It put me onto the Schedule A
0, Cheaper Than TurboTax
0, If you have a mac .... forget this product: I spent 2 days
1, Thoroughly Enjoyed Each Episode: I thoroughly enjoyed this hilarious albeit short-lived series.It would have been nice if DVD contained some additional features such as outtakes & deleted scenes.
0, if i could toss it through casios window...: after the first year
0, Solar Power - a useless idea: I've been a G-Shock owner since they came out. I wanted to go for a classier watch than the plastic G-Shock. I settled for the MTG900 in December 2007. The watch is great except for the solar power. I live in Rochester NY. During much of the year I wear long sleeve shirts and coats. I am continually struggling to keep the watch charged. Solar power is a cool idea that is not only useless
0, Not impressed...: I bought this book with a lot of hope and expectation. I have read many other vaastu books and this was another one in the series. Unfortunately this book does not live up to expectations. For one thing
1, Dream away ...: This is the one to listen to if you want to sleep deeply
1," Strong and Honest Film Music.: The critical turmoil that the film ""Battlefield Earth"" provoked"
1, Lots of pirate adventures set in Asia: This is one of those books you don't want to put down. Great story that spans the life of its hero Dirk Struan. I can picture Sean Connrey playing Struans role in a movie. He would be the perfect Scottish ships captain. If there could be any criticism of this book
1," Best realistic inside look into the black male experience: This book was the best inside look at the black male experience since Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" Cleaver cuts no corners"
1," Had Potential For 4 Stars.........: Was a very good ""read"" "
1, Very nice!: First pair of suspenders
1, Meets expectation: If you are tired of loosing your pants because your tummy pushes them down. The product is great. Easy to use.
0, Rich Young & Pretty: Since I'm not a fan of Vic Damone and Jane Powell
1," ""Rich"
0, Wow! This completely underwhelmed me.: I was a looking for a book on problem solving techniques and bought this book among others. While it became clear that this was a book written to help people live a more successful life
1, Excellent voice quality
1, Great theatre book for kids!: A terrific book for my youth theatre. I am always looking for new games to play with the kids. The key is keeping things fresh! This was a big help and a great addition to my bookshelf!
1, Not your average Floyd tribute: I had purchased The Wall 2000
0, Disappointed: I ordered the House Series for Fathers Day gift but to my dismal when I was suppose to receive the product I was told I was receiving a full refund. The company did not have the item in stock as their website inventory stated and at that late date I did not have the time to reorder the product from another company--very disappointing.Amazon was very good with communicating the situation with me and I received my refund right away.
0, Let the Buyer Beware: I should say that I bought the boxed set for seasons 1-4 and I bought season five separately
0," Very disappointed in receiving used book.: I was very disappointed upon receiving this item. I thought I was receiving a new book. Instead it is very ""used."" I am hoping to return it. It even had a note the previous owner had slipped into the box when ""gifting"" the book."
0, Great idea but....: We received this as a gift. It is a really cute idea and cleverly designed
0, Not Durable: Although this is a cute idea
0, Good
0, A real disappointment...: I hate to be the fly in the ointment but I cannot agree with the 5 star ratings the previous reviewers gave Everything and the Moon. I recently read Quinn's How to Marry a Marquis and I was enchanted! The book was light but very very very funny with cute believable characters. This one however
0, Too much surface noise: Since this cd was made from old 78s there is alot of surface noise that makes it hard to appreciate the excellent music.Sure it has historical value but the later 60s recordings on Vanguard are just as good if not better musically.With todays audio systems the noise is enhanced.Music 5 stars audio 1 star.Buy at your own risk.
1, This product is truly fantastic.: This is the first time I've ever rated anything but... this product is amazing. I use it to hold a Sony HD camcorder above my Nikon D5100 DSLR and it works great. This is a very useful tool and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to use it for a similar application. I would imagine that it would also work well with an audio recording device
1," Solid!: Build seems well made. Mounted a 7"" monitor to the hot shoe and it felt great and secure. Pleased with the product."
0, Regret for Sucrets: These are so strong with throat numbing ingredients that all the other benefits are quickly overlooked. Hey
0, a simplistic rehash of Dianetics: This book is a simplistic rehash of Dianetics. Jackins comtribution to Dianetics was the two-way co-counseling relationship whereby 2 people exchange help by taking turns counseling eachother rather than Dianetics one-way counseling style. While this uncritical listening can be helpful
1, A real BLAST form the past!!!: As great and Graphic as I remeber it!! Only now it looks even better with a fantastc picture. Could'nt ask for more....except maybe a making of....?Great Stuff!!
1, If your expecting a high quality horror script......: You will be deply dissapointed. If your expecting a lot of lame cheap laughs then you'll love it. I first saw this this when I was 12 so I just had to get it for the memories
0, OMG...Only the gore was good
0, A chore to read: Except for a few amazingly well written sentences
0, What trailer park do these people live in?: A classic story of a blossoming relationship playing out against an old lover's triangle. I found the relationship between the sheriff and Liesel to be much more interesting than the two brothers fighting over an underachieving woman like two little children fight over a toy. Unfortunately
0, Performances marred by shoddy mastering / EQ. A technical failure.: I knew something was amiss after ripping this to mp3 realizing it sounded EVEN WORSE
0," Listenable but obviously without any major songs: This CD is a big disappointment. Beth Orton is my ""go-to"" listen; I can listen to her songs in any mood"
0, Mediocrity at its best: This book characterizes much of what is wrong with the current way in which text-books are pumped out by authors/academics/publishers to serve as a new yet ultimately qualitatively useless addition to the heap of knowledge in any given field. It is not that the topics presented here are useless
1, Leisurely stroll to nightmare ending: Burnt offerings was the book to read when I was a kid and I just got around to it (20 odd years later) and what a treat. Don't look for the fast-paced blood and guts of today's fare ... Marasco deliberately paces the misadventures of a city family taking possession of a country house for the summer ... or is it the other way around? Finding out may be the funnest thing you do with a book. As the house comes more alive
1, Very Satisfied: I was skeptical at first about purchasing a used video online. But I had searched every pawn shop in town & couldn't find this movie. Service was fast & it doesn't seem to be any scratches Products is really in like new condition. My mom said even though she cant set her DVD to make the audio english she just reads the subtitles & she has still watched it about 10 times.
0, As a student: taking a course which references this book
0, Poor Quality: I purchased this along with a Palm book from the same company. This is a VANITY PRESS who puts out material from their professional association members without sufficient editorial controls. Their books are very low quality and are essentially useless. Try Prentice Hall or one of the other professional education publishers for higher quality material. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID.
0, Ok Sound quality
0, Mostly unremarkable: 2 1/2Roughly a third of the material points at a unit going places special but overall the album still sounds of somewhat predictable
0, Quirky
0, Sales MBB: Poor choice on my part
0, Good starting point for undergraduate students: This book covers a wide range of different and important subjects of this field and provides by this a good overview to students new in neuroscience. On the other hand side
1, Spidey Meets X-Men: Spidey helps out mutant friend and then meets the X-men. There is a really funny section of this book between Spider-Man and one of the X-men. Last story on Aunt May and her psychiatrist
1, NOT GREAT
0, AGAIN
1, Beautiful
0, Super High Me: This movie was mediocre to say the least. I love the idea of someone trying to get high for 30 days and making a scientific experiment out of it but I think Doug should have just stuck with that. The truth is
1, Excellent: If you are looking for a book on leadership
1," Nutcracker: This is a wonderful interpretation of ""The Nutcracher"" Outstanding performers! I realChristmas treat for everyone!!I would recommend it to anyone. It would be a great treat for the whole family to watch!"
1, A beatiful Nutcracker: This version may not be the most sumptuous one
0, Save your money: Boring
0, Read these book reviews carefully: I have only limited contact with the contents of this book - borrowed copies and people I have run into on the road who are using this book. What little I read is enough to make me want to pick up one of the many excellent Moon Handbooks on my next trip to Mexico. Some of the other reviewers site the fact that this book is terribly outdated. I would add that it is over-used... and the hotel owners and waiters whose establishments are listed in the book know it. If you are new to independent travel and have never heard of Taxco or Guanajuato or you want to feel like you are really beating a new path but still want your restaurant menus in English
1, As expected
1," An analytical approach to a review of this tantalizing book.: I appreciated this book on so many levels it is hard to pick one which i can analyticaly review it. First of all i appreciated the way this book approached the semantics with respect to disambiguation. If i were to sum up this book in one word it would be ""anthropic"". I appreciated the way the author expressed his great sympathy for those of us who are in the eccentric genius field."
1, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: I want
0, Some great songs but not worth buying the cd for: only 5 songs worth anything the rest is all noise. 2 of them are well knowns played millions of times
1," disapponted: I am disappointed when greatest hits anthologies leave out important songs. The song ""Stop"" which appears on the original James Gang Greatest Hits released in the 70's"
1, Always Were Always Will Be Great!: The James Gang was an icon in the music world and there music is still relevant today. Great songs - great sound!
0, Coghlan's Soap Holder: What a waste of money
1," Ahhh...nice aroma: I enjoy the scent of Perry Ellis ""America."" Not too strong"
1, Great songs with lyrics both kids and adults can enjoy: We all enjoy Joe Scruggs in our house. His music develops kids imaginations. Another great Joe Scruggs album is Ants
0, Doesn't work very well.....: Purchased two of these switches. Used one to replace the old Handy Switch that used to sell on TV. The Handy Switch worked for 5 years before going bad. I replaced the Handy Switch with the Leviton switch. For starters
0, Poor quality: The light switch is a lot cheaper looking / feeling than it looks online. The light switch itself doesn't even rock like a real switch of this type would do. The screws are such poor quality that I couldn't even remove one because it was so stripped which made it impossible for me to insert the batteries. All around a very cheaply made / looking item and not worth the $30 I spent on it even if it wasn't defective. Gladly returning it to get a decent product instead.
0, M.F. from south Arkansas.: Howlling 4 is a poor
0, WHERE ARE THE WEREWOLVES??????: WHERE ARE THE WEREWOLVES IS WHAT I KEPT ASKING THROUGH OUT THIS MOVIE
0, Abley Just Can't Pull It Off: How wonderful a book dealing with the impact of language death on speakers of all the world's languages could have been. Unfortunately
0, New Testament in Modern English: This is a simple book and is not much like The Bible. One would find it hard to fine a book/verse as it is written more in pargraphs. And there are key verses missing. My copy went into the recycle bin.
1, A Marvelous Translation: This is more than just a paraphrase of the original language. It's a meticulous translation that brings the New Testament to life with so much clarity. Mr.Phillips version transcends any religious dogma and clearly prresents tis version in an easily understood language
1, Quality product.: Not much to say. It works
0, The Raid: Waste of film and time ! Would not recommend this video The Raid . If you are a total gamer it sucks .
1, Masetto Is Hot!: This is the best performance of Don Giovanni that I have seen yet.Except for a little backround noise
1, Better Homes cook book: Excellent product
1, The best general guide: This is my favorite general cookbook! I love to cook and have a collection that takes 2 full size bookcases
0, Grieving sister: My sister killed herself two days ago and I am so lost and heartbroken. I went looking for a book to help me get through the pain. This book was not helpful. It seems like the author is trying to educate you on the subject of suicide rather than help you deal with it. I dont want to read a book full of other peoples stories. I am living my own nightmare I dont need to hear about other people's horrible experiences. It tells you the normal symptoms a suicide survivor experiences and tells you that they are normal
1, suicide recovery: This book is an intense look at the many phases of recovery after the suicide of a dearly loved one.
0, Heartbreaking
0, Died Without Warning in Less than a Year; Bummer: We bought this RCA RCD160 Portable MP3/CD player boom box with AM/FM tuner for strictly limited use
0," RCA RCD160: Died in 3 months. Then came back to life then died again 3 months later. Can't see dial at night. Doesn't remember cd playback settings like ""continuous"". No clock. Cost too high for this quality. Volume not exactly stellar."
1," Pretty Good: I picked this up on a whim. The best way I can describe it is if Jesus Lizard were to try to play jazz/become a jam band. There's some interesting songs here and they cover a wide range of styles. I really like the song ""sassy"" personally. There isn't much structure to the songs (ie it's very far from your typical verse/chorus pop progression) so approach with an open mind. Interesting album overall."
0, in a word: YUCK!!!!: The people who praise this book are convinced that America doesn't work and we need to abandon Justice for Nancy-style courtroom lynchings. They don't get angry about prosecutors who fail to bring good cases
0, IF you know the person who wrote the book
0, Horrible&very Loaded: MICHAEL JACKSON WON Clean Sweep!!!!!!!!!!!! the end of Nancy Grace&Her Hateful show&ways. you have to be Objective when you present news.now on the Personal Front I feel for Nancy Grace with the loss of Her Fiance
0, A disappointment of atomic proportions: Los Alamos is truly awful book: cardboard characters
0," Not as good as ""Savage Day"": If you think that this book has an intriguing or interesting plot idea I would suggest you go to your library or local used bookstore and try to find a copy of Thomas Wiseman's much superior and well written novel ""Savage Day"". It's basically the same premise but Wiseman pulls it off with great literary flair."
1, Another Good One: I came to this novel after having read several of the author's later books. I thought that the writing here was just as good. I especially appreciated how he took a homosexual subplot and kept it in the tenor of the day without pandering. It was well done. I didn't much like our main investigator
1, Sweetness: I dig this book
1, What goes on behind Jewish doors......: These situations that BatSheva HaLevi went through were very sad. This book explains the exceptions that go on within Jewish families and are very real. Although her story is not the norm
0," It does not look like an original Elizabeth Arden Product.: I bought this product (Elizabeth Arden White Shoulders) a few weeks ago and it does not look like an original Product. The name ""Elizabeth Arden"" does not appears in the bottle and the fragance it's not the typical Elizabeth Arden one that i expect."
0, Poor quality: I bought 2 pairs of these for my second and third lobe piercings to wear on a daily basis. They were the perfect size
0, Looks the same as Amazon product
1, Very helpful
0, It wasn't even in english: It's not Randy Travis. It's not even in English.It's too much trouble to bother getting my dollar ninety eight back so I'll just delete it.
1, Simply the best.: I didn't buy this recording until it was already 15 years old. It is as fresh and lovely as anything I've ever heard -- before or since. His melodies and his lyrics speak to the heart
1," Stevie at his best!!!: ""Songs in the Key.."" is simply the best album of all time. The album is timeless. Having been released some twenty years ago"
1, Awesome!: This albumn came out when I was in 7th grade. On a whim
1, Wonder's masterpiece: This fantastic album appealed to so many sectors of the music business from its day of release. It is a superb mix of catchy pop
1, Great Selection: Again
1, I'm listening to a GREAT album. Oops
0, save your money: I waited months for this book and what a disapointment when it arrived today. The book is a total waste of money
0, Uh Tom is not Boston: I am a huge fan of Boston's first 2 albums. I saw this album at the record store and was very excited. I bought it out of loyalty without hearing a song on it. I really gave this album every chance. I really tried to like it. Bottom line is this CD will be collecting alot of dust. The first song is good but sounds just like Amanda. This song alone earns the 2 stars I gave this album. The rest of the album is a waste of space I'm sorry to say. I can't beleive it took what 7
0," Another 8 years for this!: Not one of my favorite Boston releases. 1994's ""Walk On"""
1, Great but not a lot in the package: Sculpey clay is great! The picture makes it look like there is more clay in the package than there really is though
0, Vulgar and offensive: There are pictures in the back of the book that should be rated
1," Lacks the ""wow"" factor.: This book is a good read about one of the greatest players to ever lace 'em up"
0, Not as good as the first season: Not as good as the first season. The NASCAR themed episode made me want to shoot myself in the eye. And it's streaming on Netflix now.
0, PRELUDE TO THE DEMENTIA OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: I am truely amazed at the popularity of Mr. Rose's literary attempts. How sad that he knows nothing of his success
0, Very Basic: I was disappointed when I viewed this DVD. There is nothing new or innovative with Phil's short game. The 2 DVD series is because you see the same thing he's demos over and over again. If you are a high handicaper you might get some benefit from the DVD series. For me there are better short game DVD's out there and this one was a waste of money.
1, great transaction quick and product was new: The transaction went as I would expect. The product was still in it's wrapper. This vendor is the perfect advertising for internet purchasing.
1," I remember: I found the format of ""The War"" very interesting. I was ten years old when the war ended. I lived in Homer"
1, Best Presentation on WWII: This is by far the best presentation on WWII I have ever seen. It gives an over all view of the war while providing an intamit feal of involvement.
0, Think twice before buying this: One word summary: boring. I bought this because I really like his Civil War film.
1, war for your reading enjoyment: Ken Burns is one of my favorite producers of documentaries. In this film he has adhered to the highest standards of inegrity and faithfullness of one of our terrible national disasters.
0, Interesting ideas for which no evidence is presented.: While this book presents some interesting ideas
1, A Return to Common Sense: Probably the most powerful book I have ever read; a book that questions today's societal values concerning convenience and tecnological advances. As a future educator and community volunteer
1, FABULOUS!: This is the most important book anyone in Western society could ever read
1," Great album!: What a gem. Great quality with the perfect amount of ""grittiness"" for that nostalgic sound. So many wonderful songs"
0, Not my theology: He has interesting points to consider but Chamber's theology often differs from mine. So
0, Need more info: Your website was unclear as to how many clips came in the box. For 30$ I expected. Usable set of 4 clips but instead I had to make a second order and spend twice as much as I expected to eventually mount my rack. Does Yakima think I only need one crossbar on my roof rack? Anywho
0, Clips are fine
1, Funny.. but not fantastic: This is a lovely book to read to waste away some hours of your day. I found myself laughing alot at the characters and at the banter they kept throwing at each other. I felt Eleanores character was believable and i loved her strength i thought Charles character could have been done a bit better especially at the start of the book he didnt convince me with being a full fledged rake. I thought the suspensful moments especially the one at the end were roughly put in and very typical.. (dont want to ruin it for those that havnt read it)I didnt feel it as much as other books i have read of JQ but it was a good read.
0, Disappointing: I adore Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series
0," Not this one either...: ""Brighter Than the Sun"" was as cornballish as they come. The whole book went pretty much like this ""Yes you do...No you didn't...Ohhhh why I never! You want to kiss me?!"" Save yourself some time"
0, Money better spent elsewhere: I have not found much use for this book. It provides a rapid-fire introduction to many VC++ topics
0, FAKE !!!: PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON.COM. IT IS NOT ORIGINAL. DID A SAMPLE TEST WITH THE ONE FROM MACY'S AND ONE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE.
1," Mild and Clean Scent: I've been in the market for a better cologne for awhile now and somebody suggested Eternity for Men. Well I can safely say I'm very pleased that they did because this is not overpowering and it gives a clean ""manly floral"" kind of smell instead of making you smell like a logger or an over-trained cook."

1," travel pillow review: Very soft pillow and the massage feature is a nice bonus. It is a bit bulky for traveling - much bulkier than our other ""bucky"" pillow and takes up a lot of room in the carry-on bag. It also works well for a lower back massage for long plane trips."
1, Excellent Sesame Street Special: This is a great Sesame St. show! My kids like the ones where there is an actual storyline as opposed to the show itself that goes from skit to skit. This one is very cute and they watch it year round.
0, Not What I Expected: I wasn't impressed with this dvd at all. My daughter is an Elmo freak
0, Connection Fails: I have owned three of these and all three have done the same thing. Afer a month or so the light works intermittently and you have to shake it or hit it with the palm of your hand to get it to work. It seems like there is a loose connection or something. If it didnt have this issue I would give the light a great review but since all of the ones I have had failed in the same way it falls short of being a solid tool in my opinion.
1, Great!: I am a nurse and I was looking for a good penlight. This is AMAZING! It's super bright without blinding the patient but yet you can see everything you need to see.
0, Not that great: I bought this penlight and had to buy another brand since this one basically fails on most levels. First of all
1, holy sh*t you have to read the ultimates!: This volume of the Ultimates is truly amazing. Thc character development is phenomenal and the story arc is just as spectacular. I highly recommend buying this and all the past Ultimate graphic novels. Also picking up the next volume is a must because the current story arc blows this graphic novel out of the water. This is by far the best comic series out today!! It is far superior than other great books like Y: The Last Man and Invincable. Buy it now!!!!
1, Excellent collection of stories: The Prussian Officer is a well-written moving piece based on the emotional effects of conforming to military discipline. Attention to detail is superb. Other stories in this collection are of the same quality. I recommend this be added to your todo list.
0, Not for non-americans: The book and its layout are nice and some jokes are funny

1, Another JQ hit!: I loved this book! It was wonderful! I felt some parts lagged a bit and that the scene was longer than needed but it was still a great book. The characters were funny and believable and I loved them. Great read!
1, A Case of Mistaken Identity Leads to a New Life for All Involved: I truly enjoyed this Julia Quinn story. Like most of her efforts
0," PASS ON THIS BOOK: After reading ""The Duke and I"" - I went out and purchased this book- a huge mistake. Not only did these two characters have zilch chemistry"
0, IT'S AN OK READ...: I bought this book after I read Minx. I bought several other books by Quinn too. I hope her other books are better than this one because I was very disappointed with this one. There were some funny moments in the book but it couldn't make up for the boring characters and the dumb plot. There was no spark with the hero and heroine. I really would not recommend the book.
0," Should have been a ""Dummies"" book: I'd gotten this book thinking it was the latest and greatest of business books. How can you go wrong with a Harvard Press book?Apparently"

1, fast food is no better than fast sex ;0): This movie makes you feel going Mc donald's (for fast food) just as much guilty as going to a brothel (for fast sex). I think we do need to respect our food so that we can respect our own body. In short

0, Too big and low quality: Those switches are much bigger then you think they are.Low quality and flimsy.However they do work.
1," Curiosity: My family loves movies in the Napoleon Dynamite genre so we gave this one a whirl. It had ""Uncle Rico"" (John Gries) from Napoleon who plays a local policeman in this movie. Jeremy Coon who produced some Napoleon family tree movies was also on board. So it did have some of the same touches. But the pacing at times was boring and the humor fell flat when it was so close to brilliant. The characters are classic and the story line is set up for side splitting experiences. But somehow the director doesn't seem to know how to pull it off. The actors are perfect and the costumes are spot-on. I recommend one viewing of this movie for the purpose of experiencing this world. But its just not that funny"
1, Truly Amazing: I had an idea what the film was about before I watched it on DVD but I had no idea how well made it was. The soundtrack
0, did not work after only 1 month: When I first recieved this scale I loved it. The reading was large and clear. It did not have the normal tendancy to require you to step on and off to get a reading rather than an error message. After 2 weeks it seemed you needed to step on and off a few times before getting a reading but even that I could live with. Now it does not work at all. I did not check to see if it was a battery problem or not but I have only had this 5 weeks.
0," Elton John's Christmas Party: Love the song ""Step Into Christmas"" and that is why I bought this. However"
0," Don't buy this recording.: Absolutely awful recording of a great opera.This CD is in mono and sounds like a member of the audience left their cassette recorder on. Several other ""good"" reviews refer to how all the words are ""intelligible"" and there are the usual ""shuffling of feet on stage"". What kind of recordings do these people usually buy?Buy this if you don't mind tossing your money in the garbage."

1, The New Beginning: This book is really fabulous because it is well thought out. The pictures were amazing. P.J. Lynch has a lot of creativity. Amy Hest wrote an amazing book. The rabbi was cool.
0, strange: This is a fantasy movie about a Hollywood moviemaker who falls in love with a woman from a TV Soap who magically appears from his TV.The move starts very slowly and confusing. The beginning and the ending were annoying.The most pleasant thing about the movie was the performance from the actress Kimberly Oja.
1, great book: A classic from my childhood
0, Don't buy: I ordered this item twice and they keep sending the Foot Wrap. If you order from Amazon you are rolling the dice.
0, First hand experience.: First of all I don't see any reason why you could not ship this item to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a territory of the USA and if you can ship a book you can ship this type of merchandise. It is not nuclear material is just a transmitter.The thing failed in four hours of use. I had to open it to make it work again

1, Farscape season 4: Item arrived in great condition. This completes my series. I have bought all 4 through Amazon.
1," The First Contemporary Documentary Series - Now on DVD: Bronowski's passion is obvious in this series and his understanding of ""the big picture"" and how mankind's own tenacious spirit propelled us to where we are today.His narrative is informative and philosophical. I believe Carl Sagan used Bronowski's own passionate style in making ""Cosmos"" a few years later.I was ""told"" to watch this show in my Junior year in high school and I"
0, an editing disaster: My comments are not about the subject matter or the quality of the writing--the book looks quite interesting and I was looking forward to reading it--but about the failure of whoever prepared the kindle edition to edit it properly. It is loaded with errors which make it unreadable. It's obvious that the hard copy was scanned using optical character recognition (OCR)

0, Il Divo: It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I had heard the one song before the purchase
1, A bit different from Lewis's norm: This may be my least favorite of C.S. Lewis's stories
1, New Perspective: It begins with a character who takes a mystical bus ride to a mid-point of Heaven and Hell. (Lewis' Catholic views protrude in the area of purgatory but that should stop one from reading it.) Each proceeding chapter tells of a story of a person in Hell that has the ability to go to Heaven but chooses not to because each one is too indulged in something else. Lewis' creates a different view of Hell than the original stereotype. This book may help others realize the necessity for selflessness. One should look past the fact that there is a purgatory if one disagrees (as I do). This is not the theme of the book. Any Christian can learn a valuable lesson and new perspective.
1, The Great Divorce: The book was a great price. The used books I have purchased look like new. While all of my classmates were waiting for their books to arrive from Borders

1, Rich
0," Don't even bother!: The stuff is so weak that while I was spraying it my 16 week old puppy started chewing on the spray head! He seemed to like the taste and it did not even slow him down. In other sites they call this Bitter Buck as you will be ""very bitter that you spent more than a buck!"""
1, real eyecatcher!!: Excellent book!! The best of Richard's so far!!Having to find the little golden bug on each page kept them going for hours! And somehow they never got tired of this book. After it was wripped to pieces from wear and tear I bought them another one.

1, Touching story
1, Beautiful movie: What a beautiful movie that paints the picture of true love. It touches my soul to see the deep love of a man for his wife. It's the ultimate lesson of love
0, could of been: The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel. Each separately would of received more stars. It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored. This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars). Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'. He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel. In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowed
0, Poorly written: Too much fluff and perspective. Very poor editing
0, Good story-Bad writing: The author has a good story to tell but he writes with the skill of a high school senior. He should have opted for a collaborator with writing experience. Hard for me to read. Overly repetitive use of phrases such as techno-speak
0, Great idea but poorly implemented: I used this pole on a hiking trip in the Sipsey Wilderness of North Alabama. The pole was used while hiking about 12 miles.The quality of the pole itself is very very good. The length adjustments don't slip like cheaper poles. The anti-shock function works
1, Sturdy tool for the novice: Used this on Hesperus on my first climb. Won't ever climb without one and converted my dad - a long time climber. BUT other reviews had it right - this is NOT meant for the climber who is really hard on tools. The rubber base ended up with the steel bottom breaking through it and the round cap came off. The tension coil spring was AWESOME! and we both (at various times) liked the adjustable height option. I would not only recommend it -I plan on getting another!
0, Cheap
1, Good Stick: Great hiking stick also used for carrying camera during paranormal investigation having thermometer also gave temp change. For the price it is awsome will be doing back-country hiking this sprig with it

1, A Correction: The book is an excellent read. However
1, Moveable Marriage Reviewed: Excellent book for future or present expats. The author is brutally honest and forthright about what challenges lay ahead when you move your marriage to another country. It is specifically aimed at women who leave their jobs/careers behind following their husband as he pursues his career. Includes many humorous anecdotal stories and numerous resource links. Excellent read for expats
0," It is all rubbish!: ""the time period between 7 o'clock in the evening and 7 in the next morning is when tied hands come out most frequently"". That is what the author writes at the very beginning of his book. You see how ridiculous it is! Besides this"

1, A winner for the heart.: This movie is spectacular in every way. At the theater I was blown away with the lavishness and constant eye-candy of the sets and scenery. I can hardly wait for the DVD
1, Absolutely wonderful!: Unbelievable that this film did not receive the glory due. The story is presented beautifully touching on many aspects that I was not previously aware of. The costumes
0, The King and I Admirers Will Be Bored: This film was a real let down. Jodie Foster was wasted in a familiar tale that wasn't told the way we remember it. Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner keep their titles of Anna and the King.

1, One of Liam Neeson's Best.............: I'm not going to bore you with a lot of fanfare here
1, Dramatic: This showcased Neeson's talents and was a thriller throughout
1, wonderful: A very good blu-ray.Definition and sound are all perfect
1," If It Quacks Like a Duck....: I'm not going to mince words. ""Taken"" is trash cinema in the best sense. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the film's premise was pitched. Ex-CIA operative trying to rescue his comely teenage daughter in Paris after she's kidnapped by an Albabian white slavery ring. Probably the honchoes listening to the spiel were sold at mid-sentence. What makes the film palatable is the prescence of Liam Neeson. Neeson does his ""Schindler's List"" best to elevate this project above it's pulp roots. Neeson and the film's makers keep you in their grip from start to finish. After it's over though you realize that what you've seen is preposterous. Don't tax your brain cells too hard and enjoy the thrill ride."
1, really great
1," TRUTH: Ever here the saying ""Art Imitates Life?""This is true when it comes to this movie! Remember Natalie Hollaway""?...Well unfortunaley she's in some Sheiks Harem somewhere because ""white slavery' exists"
0, Business not as usual: The item did not arrive early like gohastings is known for. My family members and myself always buy from the seller because he is known for getting the product out quick but not this time. The movie has a cut through the back od the case and the dvd was damaged because of the cut.

0, A Let Down: I had to read this for my college history class
0, Longwinded: When you read a book and keep reading it and you don't find anything about the main story after several pages the book is dull and boring. This book could be written with at least 100 pages less.

0, Couldn't even make my blond hair blue: I ordered this hopeing to turn my blond hair glowing blue in support of the Indianapolis Colts in the Superbowl! I was very disapointed in this product because it did not turn my blond hair blue and it did not glow once it was on my hair. :(

0, Not very impressed: I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers. The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do
0, Most pathetic trimmer i ever purchased....: I purchased this to gift it to one of my cousin in India and after checking the reviews I was very confident that this will be a great gift. Not exaggerating
1, A Fine Product: This trimmer works like a charm. I charged it up once and have been trimming my beard for several weeks now on a single charge. Adjustable trimmer length is easy to use and works as expected. Haven't had to clean or oil it yet
0, Battery gives out: Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn't hold a charge for less than five seconds. I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on
0, battery failure: the rechargeable battery on my unit failed
0, Battery fails quickly: As other reviewers have said
0, Cheap low lifespan NiCad battery: Remington has cut too many corners manufacturing this low lifespan trimmer.The NiCad battery as you will see in many of the other reviews is very low quality and guaranteed not to last as long as one would expect.I got less than 6 months of use out of this trimmer and would not advise others to purchase one unless you need another plastic paperweight when it dies.

And after seeing the film i can whole heartedly say ""That the only person who is twisted is the man who made this garbage"". Twisted is so repetitive that by the middle of the movie you will get a head ace"
1, A funny look at dating. . . .: I really enjoyed this film - especially being single and from New York. I thought the characters were great and it was a really humorous look at dating. I also really liked seeing some of my favorite actors and actresses from television doing something different and seeing them in a full-length feature film. Overrall

1, Very nice set of baskets for the price: I was very happy when I got the baskets-they arrived 1 day after I ordered them from here and it qualified for free shipping! Now that is what you call service.The baskets are a nice size
0, Paid by the word.: The first two books in the series were decent and left me wanting to find out what happens next. This third book has much the feel of book that Angus did not want to write. He has about 200 pages of story that he felt compelled to stretch to 500 plus. He does so by having all Bracht and Calandryll act like petulant asses. I can only presume that the two characters suffered brain injuries that were not depicted in the book

1, Iron Hotel - Very Good: This was a great read. Great plot that works on a literal level and a deeper one of a journey to a better life. Lots of action and tension. Unusual setting of Hong Kong social scene and a beat up old container ship are a welcome change from so many fiction books and Llewelyn has taken the time to get the details right.

1, One of the best teen movies!: I was surprised how much I liked this movie
1, A Masterpiece Of Cinema
1, This is my absolute fave: I absolutely loved Mean Girls. I've seen it many times. I originally saw it because I've been interested in girl-related stuff for several years. I've seen Clueless (1995) and National Treasure and this is definitely the best one. I would recommend this movie to everyone in the world. It is absolutely amazing. It easily replaced my former favorite movies - The Silence of the Lambs and Clueless. Have fun watching it!! =)
1, We Just DON'T Get To See Enough Of These Movies Nowadays.....: Fey's magic gift is how she works to create a terrific balance between plot and character. It's so much fun to catch myself rooting for the characters in this story..story..STORY!!Fey and Waters make it look easy
1," a truly original movie: ""Mean Girls"" is one of the most original"
1, An all time American classic: Some movies just make history - they don't have to be technically perfect or any kind of revolution to become legends. Mean Girls is actually a sad fairy tale
1, Mean Girls (2004): Excellent movie. I can't get enough of it. The production is great
1, Highly Original
1, an outstanding masterpiece: every time i watch this movie i feel like i'm right in the mansion
1, An intriguing movie that I could watch over and over: Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are splendid together. A incredible story of survival
1, This is the Best Movie of the Century.....: A classic! MEAN GIRLS is undoubtedly one of the Top 10 movies of the post-1990's. Based on a beautifully written Rosalind Wiseman book
1, AMAZING: The difference between the protagonists (Janis
1, This is such a delightful movie. Even my mother was amused.: Amazing storyline
1, The best in the history: This film was elected as the best ever in the history by a major Taiwanese entertainment journal. Of course I agree.
1," One of the all time great love stories.: Writer Tina Fey is a genius. ""Mean Girls"" is simply audacious (Fey was snubbed of the Oscar for it). Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are the best they've ever been (which"
1, Amazing: Originally
1, WHAT A MOVIE !: It shows that the determination of the human spirit is invincible. It would make you realize that if there's no way then you've gotta make one for yourself or else . . .
1, PRECISELY the way films should be done: There are several very good movies out there
1, Must have fiction: This is an all time great general fiction movie that everyone should have in their collection.
1, Excellent Presentation: The new digital presentation from the original nitrites is incredibly clear. The movie looks better than I have ever seen it. I haven't checked out the bonus material yet
1, lovely: Mean Girls is the greatest social drama ever. What the blazes if it was 96 min. long? Who cares? The most magnificent piece in film making ever! Tina Fey
1, Great movie
1, Amazing: Usually when I see a movie
1, Clever and Illuminating: Many people mistake general fiction for genuine
1, Cady Heron and the Plastics: This film starts out with Cady Heron(Lindsay Lohan)
1, If You Only Buy 1 Movie in Your Entire Life
1," Now this is what I would call a ""feel-good"" movie.: Watching the video always makes me feel good at the end. It is my favorite movie of all time."
1, Virtually flawless: This movie was virtually flawless. I was only able to spot a few errors. Some of them included the scene where we see the popcorn jump out of the bowl and then it is empty. However
1, THE BEST MOVIE EVER: WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS
1, Incredible (slight spoilers): **SLIGHT SPOILERS**This movie is about what would happen to you if you hung around the wrong crowd. It's an interesting premise and one that many would jump at the chance to experience. I
1, One of the greatest movie's on DVD: One of the greatest movies of all time
1," The Fragile Tenacity of Memory...Friendship: ""Mean Girls"" is one of those movies that's one can't say enough about"
1, It is hoped that this disproves any theory suggesting that all teen comedies/romances are bad.: If you have seen hundreds of films and you think nothing can surprise you anymore
1, Unforgettable: This is a movie you won't forget it for your whole life. Don't see it if you're afraid of remembering it forever. It is such film which recovers viewers' faith towards Hollywood.
1, Absolutely Fabulous: The story is absolutely phenomenal
1," IT'S ADORABLE.: With ""Mean Girls"""
1, Now this is entertainment......: I gave this DVD another spin and I think I may have an interesting take. Profanity in movies seems somewhat a pre-requisite any more. HOWEVER
1, Simply Poetic: Not only is this one of the best films ever made it exemplifies the poetic writing of one of our most under-appreciated writers: Tina Fey. The writing in this movie is outstanding and Lindsay Lohan's narration is beautiful. I could watch this film again and again and still feel its powerful message. Poetry and poetic justice. A MUST SEE!!
1, 5 Stars and more!...: I've had this movie for 3 years now
1, I Just love it. I can't help myself.: I saw Mean Girls three times and i can see it a hundred times more. Its very romantic. How can people being so cold? When you see this film you can`t think about any else than love and passion. How can you think about sexual exhibition or something similar? Please enjoy every moments 
1, starring LINDSAY LOHAN - oh yeah and Rachel McAdams: The fact that Lindsay Lohan won no Academy Awards for this is a felony in the 1st degree. She is fabulous in almost every scene in the movie. Rachel McAdams does not appear in only a fraction of the film's scenes.
1, A Teen Comedy Like No Other: This is a simple love story
1, One of my top 5s: Not much more can be said that hasn't been said by others here. I think I've seen this movie on the order of 20 times and each scene still fills me with excitement and emotion. This
1," ""Funny Girls"" is more like it....: This motion picture is chock-full of intensively amusing scenes which will leave the viewer guffawing so hard that their stomaches will become sore. That pretty much describes my reaction to this film as I sat there watching it. It made me guffaw hard. Honestly"
1, Haunts the memory: I honestly don't know where to begin when describing this movie. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? A love story? A strange trip? Quite simply yes it is. And at the same time it's one of the most original movies of the past five years that aren't obscure fare that 10 people see and declare it life changing.
1, I must have been missing something...: Cady was not so detestable after all--I realized that she just really
1, One of the best movies ever made: There's not much to say about this movie except that it was absolutely brilliant!! This is one of the best movies ever made. The story of the mean girls always differs from what source you look at. It was great to finally have all the pieces brought together in a movie. All of the characters were well portrayed and the look and feel of the city was stunning. This is one movie to add to your collection.
1, It makes all your bones melt.: This MG is one famous flick which
1, fun movie....: This was a really fun movie
1, A true victory in film-making: The movie was captivating from beginning to end. From the moment Cady enters North Shore to the moment that the Junior Plastics get hit by the bus
1, Great on VHS. Fantastic on DVD!: In any format
1, Mencken as Nostradamus: Well-written
1, Mencken's Best Work!: This is a priceless gem of phenomenal critical writing from the master. Some of it is laugh-out-loud wonderful
1, Two new GREAT songs!: This review is written for the fans. You have all of the other songs on this album
1, Absolutely Gorgeous: I ordered these because I wanted candlesticks with a very tall
1, Damanation of Adam Blessing by Don Cappa the Guitarman: Another great American Band people should be aware of !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Great guitar work matter of fact the whole Band Should Heard ! Their box Setis incredable. All The CD's have really good music that should be heard.
0," Not for Forensic buffs: This book is one of the worst books I have ever purchased. It attempts to cash in on CSI the series by using cryptic quotes from different episodes. Partly through giving a ""generic"" and uneducated description of some forensic process"
1, Better Than Shrek three: My daughter and I like all four Shrek movies
1, Shrek Forever After Review: The color and sound were good. The dvds being used didn't affect the playing. I felt there wasn't much of a price different when Shrek Forever After and Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular were sold together
1, Shrek Forever After: Who wouldn't love this movie? There are a lot of underlying comments for adults that I don't care for but my daughter is still to young to understand them.
1, Shrek: I didn't quite like this as much as the other Shrek movies. It seemed rushed or lacking in something. However I still love Shrek and the movie is funny. Once again it's a nice family movie.
0, don't buy from mango64
0, Shrek Scam! for Video On Demand: This is not a rating about the movie. It is about the service. Watch out. After I purchased .99 on-sale items
1, A Real Good Album: I got a chance to hear all of the tracks on the bootleg when it first hit the streets last year.. I really have to say that it was pretty good.. When I heard that it was going to be released in June
1, When synthesizer was king: If you like 80s synthesizer music
1," Not an Oscar winner but quite good to listen...: Being more of fan of ""Terminator 2"""
0, I've heard better music of most 8-bit console systems: Besides the Terminator being an awesome movie with bad one liners and cornier action scenes
0, Disappointing: I was very disappointed in this book. It started out well
1, ICP does it again!: Damn
1, love it: my 4 year old loves this. It is a fun way to get some activity/exercise for them during winter months
1, VERY CONVENIENT WITH GOOD SOUND QUALITY: I won't go into any technicalities as the other reviews have more than covered them. We just purchased a third handset for this phone. It is so convenient to have extensions in three different rooms that can easily be moved around. The quality and features of this handset (and the two that came with the phone) are excellent - speaker
1, Present for Mom: Bought this for Mother's day and my Mom loves it. She likes a bracelet style and she's doesn't have a small wrist so it fit great right out of the box. You'll have to take some links out if you have a small wrist.
1, No politics; a good inside view from the Cavalry perspective: During March of 2003
0, Soundtrack Horrible
1, Great entertainment for all ages!: Shrek: The Whole Story Boxed Set is a great all-in-one solution for Shrek lovers! If you have a love for the Shrek movies and are looking to add them to your dvd collection
0, Does NOT have the old extras!: Ignore any review that says this set has all the previously released features and extras. Perhaps they refer to the BluRay release
1, review for shrek all the story: Very nice for amazon
1, Great Quality!: Love this boxed set! Great quality for a LOW price!! I had been looking for the whole set for a while and when I found this I was so excited for the low price! Great Quality too!
0, junk: The 700 did not work right out of the box.Wasted several hours
1, Peavey speakers: I agree with another customer review that states these speakers are awesome! I've cranked mine to about 700 watts with no distortion! Well worth the money!
1, Awesome series for a GREAT price!!: Any place else I've looked for the L Word Series
1, I love them regardless: It would be great if the writers read these reviews
1, Just love the L Word and the L Word ladies: What a great show! I have followed the L Word and watched every episode at least twice and I just love this show. The 3rd season is by far the best and I am really looking forward to number 4.
0," recluse climbing stand: This stand is recommended for trees 9""-22"". Not accurate. You must find a tree that the stand fits so the grippers totaly grip the tree. Hard to do when setting up for bowhunting"
0, Foosball: It's ok for the price. Not too sturdy...moves around alot when you play. But
1, Wonderful Thinking Man Country Music: This is a good collection of many good hits by Tom T. Hall I liked the hits
1, Laurels for Ngaio: Probably Marsh's very best mystery plot. Underestimated by those looking for details on New Zealand or the theatrical world. Those who love good
1, Perfect for thick
0, man bad;woman good: as short as this book is i would have liked it better if it was a short story..maybe if you are an irish woman living in ireland it will open your eyes to domestic violence..i'm wrong;if you are a woman anywhere this is a book for you..GET HELP! the husband is a nasty dude..i couldn;t relate to this tale..the females in my bookclub
1, Hilarious trip to Cannes: I've been to the Cannes Film festival
0, Very short
1, Mortal Thoughts Review: I loved this movie
0, Well written
1, great collection
0, 1 star for the shower scene: I like creature features generally but this one was so lame that i stopped watching 3/4 of the way thru.A few tourists/travellers are stranded on an island full of little poisonous snakes .The people talk a lot and they show lots of snakes crawling around .They have a big party
1," Really Brilliant: A.A. Troitzky's ""Three Hundred Sixty Brilliant and Instructive End Games"" is by far the best book of its kind that I have ever owned. Very subtle"
0, a piece of garbage
0, Only Received One: Like many others here
1," Gripping and heart warming all at once: I've watched the movie ""Alive"" many times but not read the original book on which the film is based. Nando Parrado's account of the surreal nightmare that became a stark reality for the passengers on that doomed Fairchild plane is nothing short of incredible. Parrado paints a vivid picture of his personal battles with the moral issues he was faced with. But it was his personal approach to the psychological and spiritual mountain he had to climb"
1, good read: This book is a good account of the actual events occurred from the futbol players' points of view. I enjoyed the honesty of it.
1, More delights of the Patinkin songbook: Mandy Patinkin has added a famiy collection to his personal discography. Few
1, Good Listening: This is a great CD for almost any age
1, amaaazing: one of the best trance hits. i love every remix of this song but my favourite has to be the gabriel & dresden chillout mix...by far. amazing song.
0," Disappointed.: This new CD got SUCH G L O W I N G reviews by the ""critics"" and it sounded so interesting and unusual...I couldn't wait to try it....I even ignored the previews customer reviews...thinking ""just must not be their cup of tea"". After receiving the cd and listening once I thought just maybe I didn't really give it a fair listening. So I played it several times and each time found it less and less interesting.The renditions are overly simplified and after a while become monotonous. I was so disappointed in what I THOUGHT based on the publicity was going to be something unique and interesting.Uh Uh wasn't....ELH"
0, I've read better by her: I typically love Naomi Ragen's book
1, Jimpster - Domestic Science: A radical departure for Jamie Odell (a.k.a. Jimpster)
1, Military History at its Best!: Wawro's book is a concise and thrilling account of the Franco-Prussian War. Wawro covers the battles
1, Music that astounds the inner ear!: I ordered this CD for Mother who had one but missplaced it. Imagine that after we received the new one she found the old one. I have heard of John Tesh but never took time to listen to his music. I'm glad Mother has reached out to expand her experience in Christian music. She has a great ear for music selctions John Tesh included.
1, Eight Below: This is the best movie I've ever seen.Great for every age. Add a star if youLOVE Dogs. They are beautiful..
1, Maybe I'm just a softie...: but I found myself shedding tears during this movie. Any dog lover will enjoy this movie about the intelligence and loyalty of man's (and woman's) best friend.This story is about a guide and his team of sled dogs who are paid to take a scientist to a dangerous region of Antarctica in search of a rock from Mercury. An accident occurs
0, TERRIBLE EDITION: The font is so small that it hurts your eyes to read it. Don't buy the edition with the cross on the cover. Who decided a burning cross is the right image for this book anyway? The tiny text will make reading this classic text miserable. How small did they make the text? Previous editions range between 400-550 pages. This edition is barely 300. That means they shrunk the text so much that they could cut out every third page or so. Buy another edition. You'll be much happier with larger font and paragraphs that don't come too close to the spine area. Your eyes will certainly thank you.
0, Tedious: Sorry to throw off the curve... but this book is long-winded and short on useful ideas. I say 'long-winded' because nearly half of the text consists of citations
0, Overpriced and incomplete: Pentax charges too much ($48) for this recharger and does not include the AC power cord to make it work! For another ($11)
0, For power only: I bought this cable to replace a cable to a portable hard drive. The hard drive is a flash drive about the size of a pocket calculator. The portable hard drive would not boot up when connected with this cable. The green indicator light would come on but a window to access the files would never appear.
1, These cables were exactly what I needed: As advertised
1, Replacing an old friend: I love this book and so did the friend that borrowed it from me a couple of years ago
1, Arnold at his best: I like this movie especially for the Soundtrack. If you like Schwarzenegger
1, Beautiful Earrings: These are very close if not the exact same shade as real Tanzanite. Considering what the cost of a pair of real Tanzanite earrings would be in this size - well I'm extremely happy to have these as a substitute! I may even order a second pair as a back up because they are that pretty. Highly recommend.
0, Piece of junk!: It is very loud as stated by other reviewers and to top it off
1, good general book: It's a good book about operas throughout the world. In my opinion it lacked more photograph's regarding each individual reference to an opera.
0, Crap!: Wow this is an extremely low budget movie with bad acting. Just another slasher movie with typical plots. I mean how many times has this type of movie been made with young teenagers drinking and doing drugs with a maniac killer after them. Don't waste your time.
0, Well written
1, Learn as much as you can before you go to Thailand.: This book was informative. It gives you a basic outline of the place. You can read this book
0, Musical version
1, Re-Discovery Great Contact Lens Cleaner: Many years ago when I first started wear hard contact lenses Lobob was recommended. Gas permeable became the standard and other cleaning products came on-line. Finding this compatible product that cleans better is a great re-acquaintance. Be aware that this product is alot more slippery than the other items I have used
1, Amazing!: I've been using a popular mainstream name brand cleaner for my gas permealbe lenses for more than 20 years. Recently
1, Lobob: Great product - cleans wonderfully and removes protien buildup. Have used this for many years and it is still the best cleaner on the market. Have tried many others but I always resort back to this one.
1, Not one of the best of Amblers: I consider this book not as one of the best of Amblers's works but still very exciting and good book to read. The plot does not seem very convincing. And unless the French police is that stupid I can not imagine why they think he can be guilty or even helpful.
0," BORING!: I have read many of Martini's books and really like the ""can't put it down"" style along with them usually being quick reads. I never really got into this book"
0, Leigh: I am a Martini fan and have enjoyed his previous books
0, Why is it called The Jury?????????????: Someone explain to me why it is called The Jury. I looked at the cover and wondered if my book's insides had been exchanged leaving the title? I can't see a connection. This book is a too-drawn-out legal story that really drags in the last fourth.
0, The Jury's Verdict? Not guilty of legal thrills: If this had been my first Martini book
0, a cell out: the title amounts to false advertising of a pallid tale that gets bogged down in pseudo-science. a minor effort by an author usually known for his uniquely outlandish imagery and irreverent wit. a very talented writer of legal fiction seems to have succumbed to rank commercial packaging. his loyal fans are in for a disappointment.
0, Not the product inside the box: The image makes it look and sound like an all stainless steel scale
0, Waste of money: Money wasted. Did not work on arrival! Tried new batteries. Nothing
1, Wow!: From the first Chapter I was hooked! I felt like I was in a movie. The characters in the book captures your heart even when you try your hardest not to like them. It's full of suspense. After Chapter 3 forget trying to put this book down. I loved it! It makes you think about things in life in a new perspective. It definitely brings reality far too close to home!
0, hated it...so unreal it was laughable: OMG whoever told this author they had a gift of writing urban lit was a total liar. I hated this book. As a matter of fact
1, Good horror tale of psychic invasion: Has been reprinted in a British paperback edition in the late 1970's-early 1980s. My copy
0, An Editing Nightmare: I have always loved reading Anne McCaffrey's work
1, great books: Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful
0, Disappointing: I couldn't wait to read this book because I enjoyed Nuala's autobiographal effort so much. I actually found the novel disappointing and almost embarrassing at times. The central character Kathleen is a bit of a dag
1, Better late than never: It just arrive in the last minute but I got it and its in excellent conditions.
1, Love it!: Amazing CD! I absolutely love it! There's not a bad song to be found on the CD. I highly recommend purchasing this!
1, Princess Becomes a Princess: A wonderful
0, No one's driving this bus(t): Just a bad
0, Um I don't know ............................................: I fell into the trap of seeing this movie to find out more on Princess Mia's fate. What a total dissapointment. I fell asleep half way through it! I feel this movie was made for 2 year olds. It was just to plain and predictable. Now I do think Anne Hathaway is funny but at times it just doesn't look natural. After five years of being princess
1, Good movie: My granddaughter and I enjoyed the first movie and wanted to see the second one together. We enjoyed the second..but not as much as the first
1, i liked it: hi my name is tori james i like both movies and i would like to see anthor movie come out oh i am tommys wife
0, Horrible sequel to PD1: This movie was so disappointing. It was completely different from the first movie AND all the books. Where in the world was Michael?
1, Princess Mia has to get married...: Princess Mia has been busy since we left her in the Princess Diaries. She has had Princess lessons
0, Hello?? Ever hear of 'Following the story line'????: I saw a behind-the-scenes clip for this movie
0, tedious: This movie was tedious and irritating. My husband and I almost turned it off
1, Excellent!: I have used mine for years too. It's big and easy to use. My buying point was that it was big. I didn't like looking around my desk for itty bitty calculators so I got the biggest one I could find
0, complex notation system: I did not use this book while teaching my child to read. This book requires the child and the teacher to learn a complex system of notation. More than just learning the different sounds letters can make together
0, Ok
1, So much Info: This book has so much infomation
1, Mexican Cantina Mystery: Yes
1," We solved a haunting mystery by watching this movie.: My best friend and I heard ""Temptation"" on the radio when were little girls. No one my parents ages knew what movie it came from. That song has haunted me for years. Then ""That's Entertainment"
0, meh
1, groove: this is one of the best movies that i have seen in a while
0, Unintentionally Funny: My friends and I laughed all the way through this excuse for celluloid. Definately watch this with people posessing a twisted/sarcastic sense of humor.
0, Worst rave movie ever: This has to be one of the most pointless movies ever made
1, awesome everyday pan: I got this pan practically for free b'c it was a friday special and had a $10 cert. I was not expecting much out of it and was even thinking of just giving it to someone. But when I received it
0, Waste of Money & Time: This book is appropriate for those in the lumber industry
0, No Kung Pao Chicken: Having visited the Chicago Big Bowl for years when I lived there
1, Mission Impossible Season 1 DVD: Fantastic! The original series was much better than the movies with Tom Cruise. I would recommend it to anyone who love adventure and spy movies. I am thoroughly enjoying all of these episodes.
0, Memories?: This calculator has many good features. Large enough for keys to be easily used
0, Bland is Bland: This book not only lacks clear examples and good explanations
1, TREMENDOUSLY INSIGHTFUL!: This work brings into the light the hardships that women on welfare endure. It does women on welfare justice that this work was published. The author was very thorough in her research
0," Piece of junk: If you are going to use this in a 2"" receiver"
0, not that good: the metal detector just beeps at anything not anything you can do about it
1, Good Starter Detector: This detector was bought for my 5 year old son. I always wanted one as a kid and hoped this would be a good starter detector. The product is a solid design and nice weight for kids. The tube is adjustable for the height of the person using it and the coil at the bottom adjusts as well. The detector function could be a little strong. Really
0, Sheila Kelley S Factor - beginning: has nothing about pole dancing so it's a little mis leading. Exotic dancing she does give you some tips. Level one means what it says.
0, The colors of the parachute DONT' MATCH with the online picture: I am a teacher and ordered this parachute for its colors (ORANGE
0, Title should have been Dysfunctional -: not Delicious. Everyone in this family needs help. If you're looking to be an amateur Dr. Phil this is for you - otherwise don't waste your money.
1, Light as a souflee and fun!: This was a fun
1, Eat it UP !!! Series of 4 books....: This series of 4 books is the first time I have read Susan Mallery and I loved them all. Her characters are wonderful and you really get to know them. She draws you into the romance and leaves you hungry for more. I can't wait to delve into her other books.
0, bad quality: I was looking forward to seeing this
0," Bad Edit?: Maybe it's just because of the horrific DVD edit but I really don't understand why other reviewers are calling this a ""gem"". I had no idea why Jane would fall in love with this Rochester (Maybe because she's in her 40's?). Maybe all those scenes got cut out. This St. John Rivers doesn't strike me as an idealistic man of God"
0, Annoying: This version of Jane Eyre does not leave much of Bronte's book. The character of Jane Eyre is received as a smiling Hollywood star and does not reflect anything of her Lowood history which is so splendidly done in the Zefirelli version. I would never be induced to read the book after seeing this movie.Watching the movie is waste time even if one likes to compares the different movie versions!
0," Insipid Characters - Butchered Storyline: I had seen all other versions of Jane Eyre including the original with Orson Wells to the ""Blond version"" with William Hurt and the ""hunk"" version with Timothy Dalton. I felt compelled to buy this one as well to round out my comparisons. Although I love George C. Scott as an actor"
1," The Best of The Best - by THE BEST!: I have listened to John Denver for about 30 years now... his music takes me to a wonderful ""comfort zone"" where I only hear the words"
1, Great album...: But an evening with JD is still in the first slot in my CD player. I was too young to really appreciate JD as he was popular but to this day I find his music to be among the most pure and sincere and I love sharing it with my young children today
1, diagnosis murder second season: I had watched diagnosis murder when it was on television. I found the dvd tobe totally entertaining and funny. The actors are amazing.
1, Legend: If you have not read a Stephen Laws book before
0, Did anyone proof this before publication?: I bought this book through an apparently misguided recommendation without bothering to read the reviews. Everything goes fine until you run across project 1
0, Terrible book!: Avoid at all costs. The book was written in 2002 and is not compatible with the latest versions of Visual Studio.The companion website is no longer available
0, Nothing but problems: I have had nothing but poor printing with cartridges from 4inkjets. I have two printers (Epson and Canon) and I must always clean the heads and the printers are almost never reading to print in good color when I call on them. I have used cartridges from 4inkjets on both and attribute the poor performance to poor quality ink cartridges.
1, all around safe
1, 50/50 bar: No kidding this lotion smells just like a 50/50 bar. Not your normal baby smell but not off-putting either. Consistency is nice. Love that I don't have to worry about putting this on my baby. Have yet to try it on my hyper sensitive skinned toddler but fingers crossed
1," How good is it?: Is a very compacted bag. Everything ""fits"" Has a nicer camera bag attachment. If you want extra room"
0, Not worth the plastic it is made of.......: Product is very cheaply made. I purchased two of them and the timers do not work. Also the parts do not fit together well. Do no waste your money. Very disapointed.
1, very satisfied: Stocking stuffer for my teen age daughter who likes purple -- just as pictured--good color;consistent throughout - a little sparkle from the polished chips -- any bigger and I think they would be too big -- as to breaking
0, Seriously lacking: I think the most important concept in learning to play a rhythm instrument is the rhythm. Something totally lacking in all playing examples on this disc. The demonstrations of playing are all very wandering
1, Back in time.: I purchased this for my husband who used to watch this show while growing up. It's like he's back in time and enjoys the show.
1, WOW!: I didn't know what a really good pot was until I bought this. Now I undertsand why people shell out for this stuff..Hardest working pot in my kitchen- which has been extremely upgraded as a result of this purchase. Better tools are easier and give better results.I use an OXO nylon bristle scrubber that dispenses soap to clean this; sometimes it needs a ten minute soak first. Actually quicker and better than the dishwasher would be- even if the machine wouldn't ruin the pot. It's too big for the dishwasher.Anyway
1, Excellent addition to any Calphalon (or other) collection: When my husband and I got married 5 years ago
0, Sticky pan and hot handles - Not recommended: I don't want to buy a non-stick pan because based on the reviews I have read
1, Awesome price
1, Versatile ~ pan
1, Simply wonderful: I love this pan. That's about all I can really say. I use it daily. It's one of my favourites and I will always be thrilled that someone chose to make this a gift to me.I don't have the problem with stick someone else mention and I can find a gazillion uses for it. Anything from scrambled eggs to hamburger helper!I jus love it.
1, My fave pan by FAR!: Very versitile! I use it daily! Perfect for large meals (we have 6 mouths to feed). Great for browning.
0," Calphalon Hard-Anodized 12-inch Everyday Pan: The pan we received does not have ""Commercial Hard-Anodized"" printed on the back as all the other Commercial Calphalon pans that we own and it was made in China. Our other Calphalon pans and skillets are made in the U.S.A. This is not the same quality that we expect in a Calphalon product."
1, Versatile: Like everyone else
0, Dimension description is misleading: Although this product looks like a wok in picture and the dimension says it is 4 inches in height. It is too shallow to be a wok
0, Disappointed
1, Nice everyday use pan: Loved the shape and area for cooking - it's a great value and a great product. Only con - not great for non-stick frying.
0," Plain white box with ""made in China"" gave me a heads up: I purchased this pan because I like the fact that it does not have long handles and is something that would be used everyday.When this arrived"
0, low quality: Developed whte spots after the first use. Looks like theanodized layer is extremely thin and not durable.Will try to get a replacement from Calphalon.
0, Food Sticks all the time: I was so exicted when I bought this pan. But the fodo sticks all the time unless I put a lot of oil. I am very disppointed. Can someone recommend what to do.
0, everyday pan?: This pan was so bad I sent it back. I would not recommend it to anyone as everything stuck in it!
0, Why the raves?: I dont understand why this pan is a best seller. I regret buying it and barely use it. Food gets easily stuck to the surface and is difficult to scrape off or clean. Its bulky and heavy
0, Not for light meals or stir fries!: I've never used a pan that makes food sticks to the surface like this one does! I cook a lot of stir fries and light
1, one is not enough: I just bought my second Everyday pan
0, review for the calphalon pan: This product is sticky
1, good everyday pan: I believe it to be a very good product for the price. It is solid
0, Think twice about this item: I have seasoned this pan three times and still
0, I haven't received it yet!!!!: I haven't received this item yet. It has already appeared on my credit card bill
0, Amazon price is low but still it's not worth it...: This product is not good at all. It heats up very quickly and things get stuck very easily. I bought this item because price was too good to pass. But after I used it for couple of times
0, This is the worst pan that I 've ever used!: This is the worst pan that I've ever used in the past 15 years!When I ordered this pan
0, Opeind Review: This Item has'nt been shipped to me. I ordered it on 12/19/06 and the amazon site says it will be shipped on 3/28/07. Thats it nothing more to say. I am disappointed with Amazon this time.
0, JUNK: Listen to the bad reviews. I didn't and regret it.From day one this pan has been awful. I couldn't even cook bacon without half of each slice sticking to the pan's bottom. BACON! It gives off grease as it cooks for christ's sake. I had to scrape the slices off the bottom of the pan. This pan exhibited NO non-stick behavior what so ever.[...]
0," Anodized not for frying: I bought this Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid in order to try to get away from non-stick surfaces that may affect your health. My health is in greater jeopardy now because I want to jump out the window after using this piece of junk. I've used 12"" non-sticks to cook eggs"
0, This is worse than the cheapest pan I used: I usually pass the review request as I am mostly all right with the products. This time I really feel bad and I have to come here and say this is worse than the cheapest pan I used. It is slow to heat up
0, Lieutenant Major Crap: It's just bad. The cover makes it look cool
1, Simply a good book: Without going into details (since everyone else has done it so well)
0, A down book for Hem: Easily Hemingway's worst book. After For Whom the Bell Tolls was published in 1940
1, An underrated
0, awful awful tea kettle: This kettle has so many design flaws I don't know where to start. It doesn't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back. The spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup. The shape (especially the angle) of the handle means that it gets very hot -- I can't hold it without a pot holder -- and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water. Mine also already started rust on the outside.I purchased this kettle about six months ago and I'm going to have to now buy another one.
0, Spout Rusted and Leaked After Three Months of Use: If I could put a negative star on this product I would. I purchased this item becuase I have always believe that Calphalon made quality products. I was so disappointed when
1, Transcends its time and its particulars: Here's what you do: 1. Buy this book. 2. Set it aside until a long
1," Shannon is the ""KING"": I am Shannon Noll's Number ""ONE"" fan"
1," Madonna is back on the dance floor......YES.: To start ""Hung Up"" is a totally hot song with 70's ABBA as background. This song is so dance music. Anyone who listened to Madonna in the early years in the 80's will appreciate this album. We get to finally hear new music from Madonna that sounds and feels like that familiar 80's sound with a touch of today. Good job Madonna !! Your have given your faithful fans what they have always loved. Dance music sung by Madonna....welcome back to the dance floor."
1, Great recording
0, So So CD: Without question
1, Just Good Songs: Took a little while for this album to grow on me
1, Great album.: This is an awesome album
1, Speechless.: Absolutely Stunning. You just need to hear one of these amazing songs and you'll be hooked like a fish with bait in it's mouth. Do yourself the greatest service of '06 and get. this. album. Good night.
1, A great bath time motivator!: Just when my 2 year old daughter was starting to resist bath time
1, Primary colors
1, Great low budget science fiction movie: I enjoy this movie. A fun science fiction film - a low budget one that delivers some very unique monsters from Mars. This one is famous for the Rat Bat Spider 
0, Oracle 9i Development: Does NOT cover the material needed to pass the 5 Developer tests. 50% of the examples do not work or are missing data. Needs major rewrite.
1, I love it: At first I was mad because I wanted to cancel my order but when the poster came I got so exited because is the same one as the Philip defranco.
0, Loved the picture but not the material: This poster was not overall worth it. I loved the picture but not so much the material of the poster.
0, Damaged on arrival: Poster had wrinkle damage upon arrival. Not significant but if you have a keen eye its enough to bother you . I'm gonna try putting it in a frame and see if I can smooth it down and reduce visibility... Not very happy with this purchase.I'll update after I get it framed.
0, never got my poster: This poster was never sent to me. The other posters I ordered with it also came at least 10 days after they were supposed to get here. Can I get a refund? Or the actual product? Thank you.
1, AWESOME!: Being a little person myself I can definately relate to this book. The character felt all the feelings I do as I go thru life. Its hard to be taken seriousely when your a little person
1, A great addition to the radio flyer wagon: I brought this canopy for our radio flyer wagon about one month ago and yesterday was the first time we used it with the wagon. We spent the whole day at the zoo and we got so much compliments because it really looks good with the wagon
0, Great idea but poor quality: Unfortunately
1, Granddaughters (and their parents) love this wagon: The wagon is perfect for trips to the Farmers Market as well as walks around the block. Sturdy and safe---good seatbelts!
1, Great all around wagon cover: I was a little unsure when I ordered this
0, Doesn't Provide Much Shade...Don't Waste Your Money: I ordered the canopy when it was on sale...thankfully! Because it is nowhere near worth $50+. If you live in an area that's really sunny most of the year
1, childrens books: This book is beautifully illustrated. The poetic language tells a biblical accounting of man choosing names for different animals. As an added activity there is a list of animals hidden in the illustrations that older children will enjoy seeking out. It comes with a CD of Bob Dylans recitation of the story. It's a book that every home library should treasure.
1, Bob is just so cool.: Bob must appreciate the illustrations in this book. My nieces and nephews do. We get a kick out of listening to the song on the CD and reading the text along with it. The drawings are appealing and only a bit bizarre. Gives the kids an antidote to Berenstain Bears.Grown ups would like this books
0, The book that never arrived: This book never arrived and has of yet still hasn't arrived
0, what was he thinking: I'm not quite sure what Eliot was thinking when he wrote this particular set of verse
1," Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T.S. Eliot: This fun portrayal of cats is worded with playful alliteration and would be a welcome book in any child's bookshelf. This is the book that the famous play ""Cat's"
1, warm. great cap: the right cap to wear in outdoors work. good enough for the navy
1, Good for the price: This cap is really warm. It is a little itchy because it's wool. FYI: shrinks in the dryer; the packaging says to
0, The darnedest thing...: D.k. whether it's antivirus software or what
0, Lousy product and lousy support from Dlink: I purchased this product and was having difficulty getting it set up. I politely called support to see what I could be doing wrong and some representative from some 3rd world country told me to bring it back to the store and hung up on me without a word in edgewise. That was after sitting on hold for 45 minutes. Safe to say i'll never touch another DLink product again.
0, NOT SATISFIED AT ALL WITH THIS PRODUCT: WHEN I WRITE THIS REVIEW I DON'T WANT AMAZON IN ANY WAY TO TAKE THIS STATEMENT TO REFLECT ON YOU AT ALL. MY WHOLE PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT IS DIRECTED AT THE D-LINK CORPORATION
0, Problematic: In general the DPR-1260 server worked as stated. I used it w/ a Canon MP530 and it only worked for printing
0, You Get What You Pay For: This thing is junk. How does a company get away with building something like this? Don't they have any pride whatsoever? The manual is useless. It's one thing having your junk made in China but why have the manual written by the Chinese? Is it really that difficult to have someone who understands English proofread it?I spent 4 hours trying to get this stupid thing to work. Probably re-booted the computer 20 times
0, Limited usefullness: I had trouble getting the print server to talk to the router when ethernet was pulled.The USB ports are not fully functional and only support a limited number of printers.The solution is not to buy this print server!
0, Save yourself the headache: I have owned this print server for about three years now. Each time I change my router I dread having to touch this print server. It is finicky with all the required steps that have been written here before. I work in IT and each time I touch this thing
1, works well
1, A journey through lands and cultures long ago comprimised.: It has been a few years since I read this book
1, Excellent for what it is: I'm just a casual fan of Gorillaz. I liked their first album
1, This is the work of absolute geniuses: I would say this belongs to the genre of alternative electronic pop...the first time you hear the album a couple of tracks stand out (their hits
0, Save your money: Save your money and just download the only two actual songs on the whole album; Feel Good Inc. and Dare. The rest of the album consists of tracks made up of random sounds and called songs. This may be the worst album I've ever owned.
1, Gorillaz - Demon Day: Before the Gorillaz - Demon Days CD came out
0, Trendy wimpy liberal crap you'll have forgotten about in six months: Skip this and pick up Wintersun instead.
0, You see my ratings. You might as well ignore this with everyone else
1, THE BEST!!!!!!: Hi
1, Great CD - A Must Have for all Music Lovers!!: 12 Tracks - 11 Great songs This is a must have for POp/Rock Music Lovers
0, An Absurdity: Completely devoid of documentation; a mish-mash of truth
1, A DARK
0, Interesting but bland: Before this book
0, Not his best: I am a Jesse fan but this cd of his lacks great songs and is my least favorite of his albums.
0, My two cents - it's worth little more: Like its newer cousin which I unfortunately ordered at the same time - I found this book boring. Too many of the questions were really easy - and it wasn't because I'm too smart for the book. When you check the answers
0, Harsh: This has a very harsh smell and does not smell at all like violets. I was very disappointed with this purchase and do not recommend it.
1, In the Teeth of the Wind: A Study of Power and How to . . .: This book is interesting
0," Why did he write this book if he doesn't even like the guy?: It seems to me that the author is actually in the ""destroy Prince"" camp - he doesn't seem to understand much about the social surroundings of the 1980's"
1," Praying Unceasingly - the Prayer of the Heart: How does one obey the scriptural imperative to ""Pray without ceasing?"" The simple pilgrim (we learn his background in bits and snatches) sets out to learn how... from both the wise and the simple he meets on the road. In a period and place where a cup of tea is a rare treat and a book one's sole possession"
1, Boxingroo Flag: G'Day I love my New Flag and it is flying high in my yard as we speak. Great Fast Service Great Product!!!
0, Damn
0," Average: This album isn't really effective in many ways. You can tell from the opening track ""THE RETURN"" that it is going to be a cheesy album. Most of the arrangement lack something that is character of Jay-Z arrangements as well as R-Kelly arrangements. The one arrangement that sounds R.Kellyish is ""FEELING YOU IN STEREO"""
1, Remarks for suchalady: Actually Jay Z said that the Black Album would be his final single release. He never mentioned anything about compilation albums or collaborations.
0, Really cheesy: WOW
0, I really tried to like this...: ...but I just couldn't. I got probably half-way through and couldn't take it anymore. I didn't feel any interest in the hero
0, Growing old waiting for toast: My husband and I couldn't agree whether to give it 1 or 2 stars. It looks fine and it hasn't broken - the buttons haven't drooped off or anything but at the end of the day we bought it to cook toast and boy it's slow.I put the first set in when I was 35 and recently turned 42 before it was done. Would be quicker to put the bread out on the balcony in the sun. The elements don't even visibly glow but it gets there in the end. So if you're not in a rush it's OK but frankly disappointing.
0, IMITATOR: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UNIT. I BOUGHT IT STRICTLY FOR NOSTALGIA PURPOSES 
0, Not My Favorite...: I don't really know why I was bored by this book
1," Dear ""Reader from California"" - You stole my review!: Well"
1," A ""wild thing"" read! I read it twice in 2 days...: Wow. I've recently discovered Rachel Gibson's work and i just wanted to say thanks. I've enjoyed everything i've read so far--this book was entertaining for sure. She wrote two great characters (Nick was dreamy. Delaney was realistic. the sexual tension was great!) and made the family history and small town life quite interesting and appealing. I will always laugh when i hear the phrase ""wild thing.."" My only issue--when she buys him a size 15.5 shirt for xmas. If i pictured him correctly he should be more a 16-17--Large or XL"
1, All around great garden tool: Ive had it 2weeks now and love it for popping out stubborn weeds and dandelions etc.. It is definitely sharp on the smooth side so be careful (I cut my thumb from NOT being careful). I love it for cutting down grass (with the saw/serrated side) that grows close to my landscaping and plants when I don't want to risk using weedwacker. I like the ruler that's etched in also. Great multi tool!
1, The Best Garden Tool: I am a professional gardener. I have used over 5 of these knives. They are the best. I occasionally lose one. Now
1, Bed digging tool available: A hori hori is the best digging tool you can use
0, Almost good: The blade seems fine
0, reconditioned areo bed: I'm not real happy with this product. We have used it two times and the air does not stay in it. The bed is deflated by morning.
0, Too many mis-spelled words - typical for a communist!!: Thank you for the reference list of communists!
0, cats won't eat them: I have 7 cats
1," Three Without Fear: I read this book in grade school and how I wish I had a copy now to read with my kids! It's a great adventure story a la ""Boxcar Children"" or ""The Lion's Paw"". I remember many of the well described details"
0, no glue holds it together: Instructions say to use super glue.But nothing gets it to hold together well.I've tried many different glues
0," Crap....: This is a ""glorified"" PUZZLE BOOK...Buy a DVD math tutorial instead (J.Gibson's)...if you really want to learn Algebra~!"
0, CHEAP... Not at all worth...: I bought it cause it looked nice in a picture
0, Talk Sexy to the One You Love: Well
0, Not Henry James Lite: Serious readers of Victorian/Gilded Age fiction
1, Interesting character study: This book was an interesting glimpse into the lives of upper class New Yorkers in the early 1900s. There wasn't much action
1, Great Outlines: I've been using these outlines for over 20 years and purchased these as gifts for the Sunday School teachers at my Church.
1, Great book: This book was a gift and the recipient says it's comprehensive and very useful. I flipped through it and it seems like it covers pretty much every angle of grilling imaginable.
1, Great Book: I've used this book a couple of times and was so impressed I got another for my daughter's family. My son in law used it and was very pleased.
1, More fun for kids than the Movie Version: This cartoon version of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is very true to the original C.S. Lewis book
1, one of my all-time favorites: i have adored this movie since i was but a small fawn and i still rave about it to my friends. i know it all by heart and have a terrible habit of mouthing out the words along with the characters ;)the animation is simple but it seems to fit perfectly... the dialogue and story speak for themselves. even if you're not a previous fan of the Narnia books... it really doesnt matter! i recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and adventure :)
0, Blah: I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I'm sure I will one day
1, Men of the Bible: This book had deep subject matter but was written using a vocabulary that was easy to read. It is quite motivational.
0, Men of the Bible: This is a slim volume
1, a must for every kid!: We love this book! We are on our third book
1, Spiritual Warfare: This book
0, Little Lord Fauntleroy: I ordered this audio CD because I like childrens' classic literature and because I like to listen to audio books while on trips. When this audio CD arrived I was disappointed because on the cover it said MP3 CD. I do not have an MP3 player and have not been able to listen to the CD in the car like I planned. This product was advertised as an audiobook without mention of MP3 on your website.
0, Cheap print job: This is an example of the difficulties of shopping online.I had read the book several years ago and wanted to give a volume as a gift. This printing is unacceptable - unpleasant font
1, Little Lord Fauntleroy: This classic should be read by everybody especially children. It is a great story about kindness andhow to think of others. A parent should read this to every child before they go to bed.
1, perfect fit: adjustable
1, Very cute helmet: The first time putting this on my son
0, Glue adhering halo is faulty...: I've gone through two of these helmets. Neither lasted very long before the glue securing the adjustment halo inside failed. I contacted the manufacturer after it happened the first time and was given a replacement. Well
1, easy to adjust: the straps took a little bit of time to line up correct on my super squirmy 1 year old but you can't beat the easy tighten option.
1, All-in-all a great buy!: I like this helmet since it does not stick out as far in the back as other helmets. My 13-month-old son has a hard time drinking his water (tilting his head back)but a lot of that is due to the trailer. I like that the helmet will grow with him. I really wasn't sure how to size it with the pads provided. There were no instructions on how the helmet should fit him (maybe that is self explanatory but I'm one of those that would like/need instructions to be sure I'm doing it correctly). All-in-all a great buy!
0, It was okay; not what I expected.: It was okay; not what I expected. The book was not easy to follow along. I actually stopped reading it after the first chapter because I was bored. It is very slow and doesn't give any facts
1, Well worth it!: This book is both well-written and thorough. If you need an understanding that goes beyond the simple stuff required for Microsoft\Novell work
0," aspect ratio?: does anyone have a problem with the aspect ratio of Wallander ""Mastermind""?. Amazon displays it in stretched out 16:9 where it seems it should be 2.39:1"
1, Distinct
1, Absolutely Perfect: I finally relented and purchased a new roasting pan
1, Tearful and emotionally powerful.: Few films can brilliantly display the sensitive love shared between two men
1, O'Connell hits the mark again!: I have read all the Mallory books and was disappointed that this was not another Mallory until I picked it up and started to read it. It grabbed my attention from page one and I hated to put it down. Only took me a day to read. Loved Sadie
0, You get what you pay for...: After my dog chewed through the power cord for my Toshiba laptop
0, Didn't match the pictures: I specifically bought these pants because one of the pictures showed the elastic band feature on the side...but these pants DON'T have that feature. So NOT what I wanted. boo... The color was a darker khaki than the pictures show but honestly more what I was looking for and the material was truly strong like people commented...but still the main feature I wanted was wrong.
0, Unoriginal and not worth the money.: Luckily
0, I used to love this bra: This used to be a great bra until they changed it and they no longer make it with a molded cup. It's a nice bra if you're looking for that style but I'm an older woman who need help in the support dept with a molded cup!
1," A Comprehensive Overview: This is a great book to get a comprehensive overview of the Bible. Gaining an understanding of the context of daily readings helps the novice scripture reader get the most from readings. Anders easy style of writing leads the reader through exercises designed to really understand God's Word. Truly faith-enriching. I look forward to more of Ander's ""30 Days To . . ."" series."
0, Does not fit: For a universal fit item it does not fit our sink properly. Do not order this item
0, Remember Madonna's look?: Remember Madonna's early 90's look? Not very flattering. I felt like I had ice cream cones on! I will be returning this product.
0, Way too small: I ordered 2 bras at the same time
1, great fit: I agree that the wires are a little longer than most but i also agree that this bra makes you look sleek when you are busty. Somthing that is a must for those women who are small in their underbust but big on top. I have deconstructed bras so I can confidently say this bra has the best of what I look for. Separated cups so your boobs don't touch eachother
0, Not a flattering shape: Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F
0, TERRIBLE: Poor Bob. All he did was change the direction of popular music and record some of the greatest songs of the past century. For his efforts a hack writer does an absolutely awful job on him. Does Bob really deserve this? This book is just terrible.
0, Gossip of the Worst Kind: The writer says at the beginning that Bob refused to talk to him for this book so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends
1, The life and times of America's bard.: This is an excellent biography on one of music's most engimatic figures. If you would like to gain more insight into the life of times of Bob Dylan
1, Works like it should....: I purchased this toy chest for my two daughters (5 & 7 yrs old). Great look
0, So disappointed: Well
1, LOVE IT!: I bought this for my 4 year old for her birthday. Her room was a mess with all her toys and i had to do something... This toy box is HUGE. We love it! It fits all of my daughters toys with room to spare! Also
0, cute toy box but wrongly built: i bought this toy chest for my little girls toy i thought it was the perfect chest after searching and searching for one but once i received it and tried to put it together for whatever reason the pieces would not fit together my dad
1," a very well told story: One of the earlier science fiction books I read. For me the basic question it forced is ""how much of the differences in daily life are due to genes"
0, This women cannot write descriptively: Despite all the awards this book has won
0, It took me two or three months to slog my way through it!: I hate to spoil the love-feast that prevails here
0, Save your money!: This book may have introduced some interesting concepts back in 1969
1, Watch review: Service excellent. Had to return product due to duplicate ordering by a family member. Returned with no problems.
1, SO much fun!: Bought this for my 4 year old son. He absolutely LOVED it. The voice cracked him up. It lasted for several months of just punching...then we had a playdate. Poor Bop Buddy didn't survive being tackled by 5 enthusiastic 4 year olds. A small hole popped in a seam and we weren't able to patch it.
1, awesome dvd
1, Very durable!! awesome!: I have it fo over a year... MY toddler whatch it about an hour a day... She carry it around
1, Fascinating Book!: This book
1, This is a great book!!: I bought this book a long time ago and have read it several times since. I absolutely love this book because it doesn't romanticize the conflicts between Native Americans and the white settlers. Molly was able to get past what the Native Americans had done to her family and accept her new life
0, Disappointing: This book begins okay
1, Another Great Super Nintendo title that got overlooked I love the Music in this one!: there were just so many good games on the Super Nintendo how else can you explain all these great titles never being played until 10 years after the console was off the market. now a days we release 2 many junk titles back in the SNES era you made a game 9 out of 10 times it was a good or great game. anyways little off topic
1, A compelling conclusion to the Snopes trilogy: Surprisingly enough
1, Christian Doctrine: This is a very clearly written book that provides many practical examples as teaching aids. It is basically an old book (though in 1994) but very good to use to prepare for ordination exams.
0," Pathetical and boring: During the ""Liceo"" period of study"
1, the success story: This booke will give the keys that will enables all humain being to succed irrespective of their field.A must read book.
0," Definitely not recommended: I had paid the premium price after seeing ""Remastered Edition."" But the image quality was inferior"
0," Beware this ""bootleg"" DVD: ROYAL WEDDING isn't on DVD yet. That's because the OWNER of the film"
0, Entertaining Fred Astaire film. Poor DVD transfer.: ROYAL WEDDING is STANLEY DONEN'S first film production and truly
0," ""new"" apparently means ""used"": I ordered this book -- the new version -- twice. Both times"
0, ouch
1, Great!: These worked great! There wasn't anything we couldn't cut while we were camping. Also really really easy to clean while we were camping too!
1, Good for at work lunches: I really like this product. The spoon is large enough to be useful
0, only 2 left: tines on the fork have broken off and now I just have a short spoon. One of the walmart item 0002096855079 lasted 4 months of everyday use.
0, Love 'em until they break!: Smart design and colors though the price is a bit steep
0, Don't waste your money!: I bought these because I am a flight attendant and I need non-metal silverware to go through security. I bought the BPA free ones thinking that they would be even better for my health. Sadly
1, Great design: Great design and compact utensil. Works great for camping. These are a bit short for adult hands though. Difficult to use without handling one of the business ends.
1, The Lost Steps: This is the best literature I have read in my life! Alejo makes the story come to life
0, The Lost Steps: This book is perhaps the most horribly pretentious work of literature I've ever read. Some people write books out of passion or a desire to express emotion. Carpentier
0, Inanimatrix: This is a series of 9 shorts each of which is
0, Boring: Rented this cheap at the local supermarket...to see what it was and glad I did. Basically nine short films done anime-style or with CGI (Final Flight of the Osiris
1, You have to understand: Joan jett is the female chuck berry and the big bopper rolled into one. She is rock. Love or hate her
1, Desperate for affection: Joan Jett has always seemed to me a little desperate for approval and acceptance
0, the tape was broken: I love joan jett would have loved to have heard the tape. it played one song and that jumped then it would not play at all. was not worth the effort to re send back satisfaction
1, An incredibly refreshing hard rock album.: If you take the essence of 70's bands like Lep Zep and Queen and mix in the nastiness of The Cult
0, Breaks easily: Our son LOVES Jay-Jay. So
0, Long after the shark is jumped: I've seen Christine Lavin in concert a half dozen times
0, Do it yourself lie!: I purchased this product on the assumption that it was a do-it-yourself product but there is nothing do-it-yourself about it. You have to pay for the lab test to be done and pay for the postage to the USA. Not much good to me in new Zealand - I should have just paid for the test to be carried out in a lab here in the first place!!
0, Not $15 Lab Fee!: The description reads that the lab analysis fee is $15. Wrong!! It is $30!!! Twice as much. That's over $40 (counting the cost of the kit). You can probably get something locally done cheaper.
0, Total cost?: You would think you buy it
1, Asbestos testing: Just as advertised. Only problem was that it took 3 WEEKS for the lab to receive our sample. Don't know if there was a problem with the mail or it took the company that long to get to our sample. Regardless
0, Is Jay Jay Junk?: My son just turned 3 and loves Jay Jay and Friends. We purchased his first Jay Jay about 8 months ago and found that he was able to pull off one of Jay Jay's engines under his wing. Obviously this is a choking hazard. Thinking that perhaps we had a dud

1, THE BEST !!! **************************: THE BEST GROUP AND A GREAT CD
1, Butler: Great movie. Gerard Butler is quite an actor. You wonder if he made the right choice at the end. You have to sympathize with his wife over his decision.
1, Bad Reputation gets a great reputation!: I have always been surprised at how little radio airplay Joan and her band receive
1, Plato's Cave redux: Atlas Shrugged describes a socialism beyond extreme that could only be countered by a capitalism also beyond extreme. It's really as simple as that
1, 10 Pages of Really Good Ideas Jammed into a 1200 Page Book: I give it four stars for the sheer magnitude of the effort (it took about 6 years to write). All of the characters are one dimensional archetypes. The dialogue seldom rings true. The philosophical ideas are potent

1, Inspirational in moderation....: This book has had a significant impact on my life. While Rand was pretty extreme in her views on government and the duality of humankind
0, WHO IS JOHN MALT?: This is probably my most favorite book. I've only really read one book but this is still my favorite. The good guys are just so great and every aspect of the writing is all about what amazing industrialist ubermensch they are
1, great book: I failed to read this book when in college. I highly recommend it so you will better understand wher our country is currently going through. Aya was amazing to have envisioned this happening to us when she wrote it in 1950's. You are trully economically and business illiterate if you don't read this.
0, pseudo-intellectual and not interesting: Atlas Shrugged is clearly an attempt to legitimize global capitalism
1, Quality writing: Although I agree with the imagery of perseverance
0," The Antidote to ""Atlas Shrugged"":: Imagine all her beautiful"
0, Ayn Rand turns rich white people into the most slapable people on earth: Ayn Rand must have set out to make rich white people more smug jackasses than they already were. Aside from the fact that the book is just terrible and not really that well written
0," Don't waste your time!: This book has been regarded as one of the ""Greatest Books"" of all time by people whose job is to review books. I will save you a lot of time and tell you that if you read the first 300 pages"
0, I just don't agree that this is a masterpiece: I had heard of but never read Ayn Rand's fiction so decided to read Atlas Shrugged to enlighten myself on her philosophy.What I found was a tiresome
1, Still Relevant: The fact that a book written half a century ago can still stir up heated debate is enough of a reason to give this book a spin. Unlike other controversial reads (i.e. the communist manifesto
0, Outrageous price: Let me start by saying this review is regarding the Kindle pricing - the book itself is fantastic and a 5 star for sure.I recently bought a Kindle in large part due to the advertisement that hundreds of thousands of books can be had for $9.99 or less; clearly I should have researched a little further before taking the plunge because $18.99 for a digital version of a 50+ year old book is insane. At the moment Amazon seems to carry 3 physical versions of the book - the most expensive costing $14.18 (and anybody who had read this book knows that is a lot of paper and ink).I was looking forward to re-reading some of my favorites on the Kindle but I guess that won't include this book.

1, A Lesson for today's world: I haven't read this book in 25 years. Completely forgot about it from high school/college. Our book club read it for April. The book is ageless. It is so true for today.Tax the inventors
1, very informative: Atlas Shrugged is a very informative book on the age of Business and its developement. A good read for anyone who has an interest in business history.
1, Atlas WILL shrug: A must read for anyone concerned about the future of this country. A life changing wake-up call for sure! Thought provoking at least.
1, A Must: Considered one of the two most influential books
0, Religion and Rand: Atlas Shrugged inadvertently points out the incongruous nature of the cultural marriage between political conservatism and Christianity. Rand's Objectivism is incompatible with religious belief in general

1, Read it because we are living it...: In these times it's important to know that we do have a voice and we can make a difference. Atlas is a wonderful story about the world coming to a standstill because those looking for a handout pushed those who produced just a bit too far. Look around
1, Capitalism rules!: If you like a long drawn-out story ending in a sudden burst of cheap romance and action resolving to a cheesy ending
1," This book will change your life forever.: Like the Shins cd Natalie Portman had Zach Braff's character listen to in the film ""Garden State"
0, Interestingly written but too flawed to be embraced: Depending on your belief system this is one of many viewpoints: from an alternative lifestyle to a road to hell. She was a good writer but her Eastern European block upbringing warped her perceptions of life. I feel sorry for those who embrace this philosophy - it is as cold and hard as the East Berlin she escaped.

1, Excellent Story--Better than the TV Series: Note: This is more of a comparison to the TV Series than an actual review. It's mainly meant for those wondering if the Air movie is worth a purchase after having seen the series. Spoiler-free.I liked the story of the Air movie a LOT more than the series. All the plot elements that I thought were silly and/or convoluted in the TV series were removed in the movie. Everything was explained clearly

0," Not Finished But Already Disappointed: I love the Kay Scarpetta novels and can't wait for the next. I just wish Patricia Cornwell had used her considerable talent writing a new Scarpetta instead of this book. I have just started reading Case Closed and already have noticed some glaring errors. In the first chapter she mentions the Duke of Edinburgh birthday. I think she means the Prince of Wales as the title ""Duke of Edinburgh"" was created for Prince Phillip. Also she claims the first victim of Jack The Ripper to be Martha Tabran. Every other Ripper book lists this woman as Tabram. These are just two examples of sloppy research and I've only read three chapters. All the money spent on the research for this book and she couldn't hire a fact checker?"

1, It's a Rubbermaid container so it functions as expected !!: I've recently bought two different rubbermaid containers of this 8 quart size. The first one did NOT seal at all but I planned on using them to organize my small tools so I did not care. This container I plan on using exclusively in the kitchen and so far they seem to be really quite good. When closed they do not SNAP shut but still seem to seal well. I have to admit that I have only stored dried food stuffs in them so far so I don't know if the seal is 100% and I've only used them for a month so no food product has gotten stale so far. With the '4 for 3' sale
1, FULL MOON DOES IT AGAIN: I just watched the DVD and it was one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. I really liked the storyline in this film. There are some really cool scenes in here. If you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary then this is the movie to get. The ending left it open for a sequel or two. I read about this movie in Fangoria and they said it was a must see and they were right again! Can't wait for more.
0, This movie is a waste of my beer guzzling time: This movie goes well beyond where no one would go. Its boundries crossed tatared with the light of other films. This waste of film video is scene by scene and word for word ripped out of almost every horror film in existence. It is the blackend botton of a pit in dispair. It not only makes jokes about some of horrors greatests influences it is an utter self shutter of human perversions.

But what happens when the music transcends that?The easy way to describe the Jennys would be as a female vocal trio who use strong harmonies and sparse instrumentalization to render folk songs in their own unique and beautiful way.What the Canadian trio accomplishes though is so much more than that. Three voices so perfectly matched as to transcend langauge and to

They came in handy to wear when I was hauling myDbest Two-Wheeled Collapsable Handcartfull of tasty treats to my bait pile in less than ideal weather. They are 'mini' in name only because they are one mighty comfortable pair of boots! Sturdy and well cushioned they made slogging through muddy areas a breeze. They were easy to hose off and are stored in a handy Sterilite Large Storage Container ready for the next season's scouting. I highly recommend them. ~ The Boss"

0, No Hero!: You know I have been plowing through this book
0," Don't be sucked in by the marketing!: I am an avid reader of all Genres and I was given an advanced copy of this book by a book store owner. I usually give a book 100 pages before I give up on it. I went to 300 pages with this book ONLY because the book store owner wanted a review. Not one of the characters was interesting or likeable. The pace is slow and the plot is tedious and boring. The writing is self-conscious. The only reason it is on the bestseller list is the marketing ploy which hypes this work as ""Harry Potter for the adult""."
1," Definitely NOT ""Harry Potter for adults"": Very well written book... but awfully long. The 200 pages in the middle could be lost - without any damage to the quality of the book.It took me a while"
0, tedious: Despite the positive reviews here
0, Where's the magic?: I was very excited about this book
1, Good but tedious: This is a great book but a slow one. Very tedious at times because it is written like a lecture or a scientific paper. It is written like a typical book of the early 19th Century with all the English snobbery
0, Whew!: I read all the wonderful reviews and bought this book. I have picked it up 3 or 4 times and tried to get into it and I have yet to manage reading it. I just CANNOT get interested in the story or the characters. I LOVE the genre. Maybe it is the writing style

0, How can a book about magic be Boring?: I'm at page 300
0, a tad wordy: The story is interesting once you dig it out from under mountains of extraneous words. This book needs an editor who can cut out 500 pages. If this is what wins hugo awards these days
1, A great read: First off
1, A Remarkable Achievment of Fiction!: Ms. Clarke has created a brilliant work of 'historic' fiction. I was continually struck by the sheer power of her prose and her flawless recreation of the written and spoken language of the time. To sustain such a voice through hundreds of pages is in itself a great feat. However

1, New favorite artist: Not much to say except that I have been listening to this nonstop and it's still just as good. It doesn't matter what genre of music you are into. If you are a fan of excellent music you would like this. Listen to a sample and decide for yourself. I can't wait for the next album.

Christian wives wait for the first time to make love and almost all are disappointed. The facts are that while women enjoy the closeness and bond of intercourse with their husbands
0," beware of extreme bias- this book is not for everyone: I know this is a ""Christian"" book but what it has to say about masturbation and homosexuality is inconsistent with healthy human natural desire. If you want a book that conforms to a very narrow view then this one is perfect. If you are looking for equality between the sexes or up to date information about human sexuality then you won't find it in this book. Also the authors stole a lot from Masters and Johnson and do not give them credit. I thought stealing was a sin."

The container to keep the food in is a good idea and it does have a lot of food but I have found a dozen similar items that cost WAY less than this one. Wish I would of found them before I wrapped the gift.

0, Good idea
0, Don't buy it: This is the third one I have had. First one worked great till a stone was in the hawaiian coffee beans I used and jammed the burr grinder. Second one digital panal was broke right away. Third one digital panel broke after 3 years. I m not buying any more.
0, I like it despite its problems: I have experienced some of the same problems that others have already listed:1. Temperature and brew time are substandard.2. The display started losing some of its elements some time ago.I've had it for about four years and have not had any other problems
0, Save your money: My husband bought this coffee maker for my birthday last June. For about 6 months it worked perfectly. Now it has started making the coffee so strong that it looks and tastes like mud. I make 4 cups in the morning and have had to pour it out because it uses a half of hopper of beans. We called customer service and they told us to send it back and they would send me another one. The one they sent is worse than the one I returned. My husband called today again and was spoken to very rudely by a customer service rep. Would I recommend this coffee maker to anyone...NO.
1, Over 3000 cups of coffee: I had the former version of this machine. I used it daily for 9 years and figure that I brewed over 3000 cups of coffee on it. The convenience of the grind is excellent. Coffee is consistently wonderful. New features of quiet grinding

1, One of the best CD's I've heard in the last few years!!: Every now and then you buy a CD and WHAM! you can't stop listening to it. Listen to this album all the way through then listen to it all the way through again. I believe it's a masterpiece. This is one of the best bands around right now. Yeah
0, If you like AM and Being There
0, Cheese on par with Andrew Lloyd Weber.: It's pretty clear from this album that Jeff Tweedy & co. are too old to make vibrant music anymore. They know it too. They took the desperate step of switching from one derivative formula to another derivative formula in the hopes of making music fun for themselves again. They tried
0, You have other Wilco albums to buy before this one!!!: Sorry
0, Not what I expected...: I really wanted to like this record
1, Magnum Opus: This album were my personal top 1 of the last year. Here in Brazil people don't even know what Wilco means and this is a sad fact. This album has perfect songs and (most of all) perfect lyrics which mix up surrealism and romantism. Songs like She's A Jar and the two versions of Shot In The Arm prove it. The eponimous track is an happy meeting with Beatles
1, A must have...: Girls Aloud live shows are fantastic
0, PAL FORMAT!!!! BEWARE!!!: The description says NTSC

1, Good Read: Liz and her partner of ten years Joanna have decided to split up by mutual agreement. Liz's friend Connie has been in a terrible accident and Liz goes to see her in the hospital and runs into Grace an old flame who burnt Liz badly. The flame is rekindled
0, Pathetic: Was only able to force myself to read the first 37 pages before I decided a mind is a terrible thing to waste on trash. The dialogue is ridiculous; the characters are silly. I don't mean to sound trite
1, Quick paced and well hooked: Although I tend to agree that the characters are a little on the unbelievable side
1, BUY THIS SET THEN GET DARK OF THE MOON SEPARATELY: This is a great
0, average: Very average book! Frei doesn't go down as one of my favorite sports writers. Loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story.
0," Eric---Come back to us...!!!!: I respectfully submit that this album was disappointing. The horrible background vocals against Claptons voice and guitar are a more tortured combination than Placido Domingo and Willy Nelson. Give us more of the stuff you are best at--blues with a raw edge. Remember ""From The Cradle""? DOOO WAAAHHHP--- oh please. Too much froo froo."

1, Child Development - The First Two Years VHS: This was an excellent video. I used it for a parenting class for young mothers and they too found it very helpful. The format was easy to follow and the wording was easy to understand. The pictures were of real situations and were easy to relate to. The content was excellent showing the stages of development well in the time period of the video. There was some multicultural content as one of the children and his parents were oriental but I would have liked to have seen a little more as the audience was from a variety of cultures. A great review for second time parents and a valuable resourse for new parents. Well done!
1, A very thorough guide: This was a very thorough guide to selecting home schooling curriculum. A lot of information. It helps if you can get outside opinions on curriculum
1, Great Phone!: I have had this phone for 2 months now and I love it! I switched from Nexel because they kept dropping my calls and had a very poor service. I love this phone - it can roam (which apparently you can't do with Nextel) and it alerts you when you're in a roaming area. The only weird thing was that in 2 different stores I was roaming
0, Not even close to the book...: When it comes to books being made into movies-I always give a lot of leeway...EXCEPT when they take the whole of it (rather than just parts) and rewrite the story and characters! If I had never read the book
0, terrible!: The movie I received was an illegal bootleg copy without an audio track.Beware and do not purchase.
0, Poor materials and bad customer service: This glass used to make this teapot is very thin and fragile. The filter cracked very early on and then the pot itself broke when being washing. Also
1, Underrated Film making.: I really like this vision of the wild west. Costner has redeemed himself with his direction and realistic portrayal. Great performances by him and Duvall. The shootouts are as realistic as it gets. If you love westerns
0," Don't even think about seeing this movie!!: I rarely don't like a movie. This was one of the worst films I have ever been unfortunate enough to see. It's not ""slow"" or anything else that might justify how aweful this film is"
0, Mother....The Paint Has Dried!: I so wanted to like this film. I loved Kezza in Dances and A Perfect World and I wanted to love him in this
1, Great Movie: This movie
1, Best lettuce/vegatable keeper: I like this for keeping produce fresh and lettuce crisp for a long time. I have a Tupperware vegatable keeper and hate it. The produce sits right in any water from rinsing the produce and rots quicker. I highly recommend. I have 2 :)!
1, Really works!: I got this around the same time I purchased the Rubbermaid produce saver containers. I like to buy the bags of baby romaine mix and bags of baby spinach and then combine them. With this container
1, Really does keep veg fresh 2 weeks - sometimes longer: I have used it exclusively for greens (lettuce
1, Awesome lettuce keeper!: I purchased this for my mother who is always complaining about her lettuce turning brown and wilting. She has tried all kinds of things to keep her lettuce crisp and fresh; from the green bags to putting her rinsed and chopped lettuce in a pillow case and putting it on the spin cycle in the washing machine to spin out the excess water in an attempt to keep her lettuce crisp. Needless to say she likes her salads. Since receiving this product
0, Lid broke in a week: This might be a great product
0," Not much of an insight: For an enthusiast who read ""Peopleware .."" and ""Why does software cost so much "" this book is disappointing. It discusses a few relevant points"
1, Great Price: Great price but do not expect to put alot of music ont that 128 mb. The whole deal about changing your musc files into ring tones is not the card's fault. Do some research and you will get it to work.
1, The First Woman Doctor: The First Woman DoctorI have chosen this book because I¡m interested in the medical field. Also I really like books that deal with medical stuff. This book has ü pages in the whole book. The book has no table of contents
0, Sent me wrong DVD: I am disheartened to receive Ghosts of the Abyss which doesn't play in North America! Wrong language wrong DVD. I would like to receive the proper Zone when I order.
0, WOW: Don't waste your money!! I can not even explain how BAD this video is... Half the video is this gentleman showing you how to anchor the bands?? and from there i just gets worse...
0, Poorly done: This movie is pointless and boring. Plot really goes nowhere and certainly not entertaining or funny. I was highly dissapointed based on the previous reviews.
1, Wow!: I just started going to school again after a very long (nearly 10 year) hiatus and decided that I was going to dive into my math prerequisites first
0, Not the recipes I remember from the 60s: I was hoping to see the recipe for the 7 layer cake they used to sell in the bakery. The only thing I remember out of the book was the chicken pot pie my mother used to love when we ate in the downtown Hudson coffee shop in Detroit.
1, Good workout: I really like that the video is divided into 3 10 minute sections so if you are running short with time you can just pick the area you most need to focus on.
1, Awesome!: I can't stop reading the Troubleshooters series. I am completely addicted and love the way each book focuses on a different main character so that you get to know all of Team 16.
1, Great Book 
1, more brutality from Kang and Hideki: An excellent disc for anyone interested in the NYC underground new music movement. At times bombastic and truly brutal. Having had the opportunity to actually see Dying Ground live at the Knitting Factory (when they still booked jazz and new music) This disc is a welcome reminder of that evening. Too bad we must pay the inflated Japanese Import price
1, Excellent: When Al Kooper formed Blood Sweat and Tears in 1968
0, Ummm...weak: i would never get this again...its way too oozy when u open it. but it does the job.the flavors were fun! quite potent.
1, beautiful and very soft
1," Learn to Sign your ABC's: I have been signing for 25 years and trying that long to teach my Mom the alphabet. In ONE viewing of this Volume of Signing Time (we love them ALL) my Mom learned to sign ALL her letters! She said ""Rachel could teach me anything! She is fabulous to watch!"" This video not only helped my little girl with her Signing alphabet"
0, Needs help: Long and short of it is that the book touches on so many subjects that it really doesn't spend enough time on any one. This makes it almost impossible to learn from it on your own. If you get a good professor to fill in the holes this will make a nice book to serve as a reminder or guide....but otherwise its probably a waste of money.
0, Awful as a text
0, Not the optimal means to master mathematical physics: This was the book used for a graduate level mathematical physics course at the University of Houston. Yes
0, Blah!: Got this item as a gift for my Father
0, Horrible: This video was horrible. Very cheesy production - more a video of a marginal beginning dance class than a professionally produced video production with any pre-planning. Don't buy it - you will not be happy.
0, Good while it lasted: I have the other Bucky eye mask that comes with earplugs and is made of a velour type material and I love it! I recommend it to everyone I know! Because of that
1, Love it: I had a similar sleep mask before this one. I still love the shape. The molded eye cups are so helpful. WIth other sleep masks my eyes would get irritated but never with this one since there's room for my eyes to blink and breathe even while blocking out the light. I also really really like the pattern. It seems silly but it really does help me keep track of it better.
1," Not Just For Women Anymore: I purchased one of these 40 Blink masks for my wife since she sleeps with a cloth over her eyes. The slightest light keeps her awake. I however can sleep through a stampede of buffalo at a PETA convention. My wife however did not like the mask so I ""borrowed"" to take my daily naps with since our room has giant floor to ceiling windows that allow the sun to blaze in. For me the mask works great. I've always struggled with claustrophobia so I thought I'd have a problem but the design keeps the fabric away from my eyes so I don't feel trapped. It's super lightweight and comfortable. The band is not even noticed. No light gets through and I sleep sound. I can't compare this mask to other brands since it's the only one I've ever used but I think it's perfect. Even picked one up for my mom."
1, From my favorite writers...: I enjoy Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux's works very much
0, binding problem: My copy is not bound correctly. Page numbers begin with page 2

1, Fun and effective: I loved the It is a combination
1, Additional Information.: CD has 10 tracks from the 1945 AFRS Christmas Jubilee Show
1, Angelica: A Beautiful Blend Of Rock And Opera: This is a very interesting recording. It definately has a unique sound. Even if you don't care for opera there are some great guitar solos. My personal favorite is Ave Maria
0, out of stock: I ordered this for my grandson and was very disappointed to see it still listed for sale although I was told it was out of stock.Amazon...get on the ball.
1, Good product.: Product was just as advertised. Price was better than anywhere else I looked. It shipped and arrived very quickly.
1, Used for non-cream purposes: Well sir. Let's just stop a spell and think about all that has been doing on and everything in our rapidly merging minds
1, A beautiful Appalachian memoir!: Simple and truthful. If you love the Appalachian South
0, Disappointing: For anyone bright enough to earn a PhD in economics this book will vastly under-deliver. The author should be embarrassed.
1, Fun Time Western: Just an over all good western with plenty of star appeal.Great scenery.A descent transfer.Good story line.If you like a good family film
0, Didn't hold my interest.: I like cozy mysteries and I like quilting
1, Great reference book: My wife purchased this book while having difficulty breast feeding. It wasn't long after everything was working out perfectly. Thanks
1, Good deal: I have been listening to an old worn out cassette tape of this album for years. I grew up listening to the record of it with all the crackles and pops. It is nice to finally have a good recording. I love it.
1, Speaking to the Heart: This cd has become a faithful companion as I work at my computer. As I focus on stressful matter it speaks peace to my heart. Thankful for the gift of deep creativity.
1, Best book ever! Lincoln The Unknown: This is my most favorite book of all. It really helped me to get to know this great man. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I also wish it was still in print
1, Still the Greatest!!!: As I write this review
0, Not a good reference: Unfortunately I purchased the book when it was released and never had an opportunity to review references. The book has many many mistakes and is not very engaging - I like the structure of the chapters but compared to other references it fall far short - it was a boring read.
1, This book shows you how to think like a PMP: I feel so strongly that this is my first Amazon review. Of all the PMP review books
0, Too old to be useful: The version I was mailed was very dated. It was so dated as to be unhelpful. I ended up having to buy other materials. If you are going to buy one of these books
0, Very disappointing: I've tried several recipes out of this book and have been very disappointed with the results. The 'Broccoli and almond quiche' is very oily and doesn't taste that great. The 'Lentil loaf' is just awful. The 'Couscous with chickpea stew' is okay
0," Learn it is a waste of money: As with all Barbie toys this comes with a million little pieces. Definitely not something that you want if you have younger children in the house.This toy is absolutely a waste of money. It is cheaply made. The ""chalk board"" comes apart constantly"
0, Zia toner: Beware. I received something different than what I ordered. Seems they don't carry the pictured product anymore.
1, Fantastic Book: I recommend everyone read this book! Nussbaum
1, very high quality: Exactly as expected- very high quality- but one downfall- extended wearing can be uncomfortable because they dont breathe. Of course that is a trade off- these block a lot of outside noise
1, My daughter could not get enough of this story...: My daughter loved this book and I loved reading it to her! We had an old scholastic version from a garage sale and I wanted to see what else was out there. I ordered this edition and it is one of the 20 or so children's books that we will keep in our permanent collection. These illustrations are great. The story is now probably my favorite tall tale. I also think this is a great read aloud for the 6-8 year old crowd.
1, Great way to practice signing!: We have volumes 1-6 of the Signing Time DVDs. This CD is the perfect way to practice the signs you learn in 4-6. Every time we get in the car
1, Banana Republic has good taste: I got this CD at Banana Republic after I had been listening to it over the in store speakers. I love bossa
0, levitating top: This is an attractive top. I look for simple scientific items like this for nephews and grandkiddies so they will understand the principles. I could not get the top to work even using a levitron starter. I called the company that Amazon sold the product thru
1," Furious IV geek who needs more...: ""What's Become..."" is good. But you should also check out the newest release by FIV it's titled ""...is that you?"" release date April 2003. Go get it if you are also a FIV geek."
0, Somewhat disappointed: I registered for this when I was pregnant and received it as a gift. I wish I would've registered for a different one now. It was a long time before my son was able to touch the base with his feet so for the longest time we had to put a box under him so that he could stand up. There is no height adjustment! He would sit in it and play for awhile but every now and then he would start crying as if he was in pain. My mother-in-law thinks that the ball release was pinching him but we haven't been able to confirm. My mom bought my son an actual walker for Christmas and he prefers it over this. We also just purchased him a jumparoo that I am sure he will enjoy! My advice to all parents is to shop around. You may be able to find something that will work better for your little one!
1, I like this product: My daughter is 6 months and she loves this toy. In the beginning I had to place a pillow under her feet so she could move around but now she is tall enough to reach. No paint chipping yet
1, Military pulp fiction: Two Marines are assigned to make a trek hundreds of miles long to bring serum and a very heavy keg of something to a remote American consulate in Shunkien
1, A good Christmas video for the collection: This is a very good video for the collection (however paying $40+ for the VHS is crazy). Dolly Parton and Lee Majors are very good in this. The story is a bit hoakey
0, Not what I expected: Maybe my expectations were to high. The movie looks like it was taped off the TV then converted to DVD. The picture is blurry on my tv and the sound is not with the picture at all times. Overall I am disappointed I thought it would be a little clearer. Especially since I paid almost $30 for it. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1, Healing Crisis revealed: Great information. I have talked to physicians on this subject and ended up with a 90 yard stare. It is good to have clarity regarding this information.
1, A lot of these reviews are BS: When i first heard the album
0, Not Good: Well what can I say about it
1, remember when blink was punk?: if you've forgotten that blink-182 used to be a punk band
0, A Turning Point in The Worst Cds Ever: If at once you are able to listen to this album without having the urge to deystroy yourself
0, Sadly misleading: If you are truly inerested in a guide book to professional people in the industry
1, Great Read: Very good book
1, a solid introduction into the world of Philip Marlowe..: The Big Sleep
1, Finally a book with ummph!: If there are flaws in the plot
1, Best collegiate Latin Dictionary: I purchased several Latin dictionaries prior to this one and this is by far the best. Other Latin dictionaries were almost Byzantine in the way they presented their information. This dictionary is straight forward and includeds instruction on conjugations and declensions. It also lists the four principle parts for every verb! Who could ask for more? No more wondering whether or not mitto conjugates as a regular verb. It has helped me to excel in my Latin 1001 and I plan on using it throughout my studies as a Latin minor.
1," Every "" want to be author"" should read this book: Most first time authors know ZERO on how to write and sell their first book. This book tells you how. If you are even thinking of being an author- get this book!Rick Frishman Pres. Planned TV Arts (NYC) Co-author GUERRILLA PUBLICITY & GUERRILLA MARKETING FOR WRITERS"
1, Very Useful Tool!!: Sorry
0, the content is totally unrelated to the PRAXIS exam: I do not recommend this book as a study guide
0, Dry and Disappointing: I had to do a rare book search for this book and when it came I couldn't wait to dive in. But my enthusiasm quickly subsided into utter boredom. Maybe the author was there and maybe some consider this a WW2 classic but I found it very dry reading and very easy to put down. Besides that fact
0, Poorly designed grill: I liked the LOOK of this fan
1, Feed: FeedThis DVD is not for the faint at heart. While it was very disturbing in many aspects
0, Bigger Isn't Always Better: Feed's got a very interesting concept
0, Beware! Too short!: This cover is too short to fit my Kitchen Aid mixer by about 3-4 inches.Very nice about it when I complained-offered to return my money and let me keep the cover
1, mixer cover: This product was exactly the right size and was received in a prompt manner. It was just as it was protrayed in the add. I am very pleased with the company and the product.
1, My son enjoyed it: Got this for my 5-year-old shortly before kindergarten was to start (he kept telling me he wasn't going). He really enjoyed it and had us read it to him repeatedly. I think anything that helps dispel the mystery of what to expect in kindergarten is great
1, A must for every artist who draws the figure: At first glance you may chuckle at the 1940's hair styles and nude women in pumps. However
1, Do you like films with a dystopic future? security-surveillance state? A.I.? - this is the cyberpunk film for you: I just finished this one
0," One Star is Generous.: The ""Book"" was a let-down. It failed to satisfy even my most basic expectations for this subject matter."
0, Weird pricing?: Why on earth does the Kindle edition cost more than the paperback and hard cover versions?And paperback costs more than hard cover?This is either a typo
0, Ka-Ching went the cash register: Gotta give Bennnet SOME credit - he sure knows how to turn incessant
1, Excellent
1, Honest! The Polls are misleading. Bennett tells the truth!: Bill Bennett has been one of many voices crying in the wilderness about Mr. Clinton and co. shenanigans. Now legitimized by the finallity of the current scandal
0, They chopped down trees for this?: Frankly let's face it. If Clinton was Republican this book would not have been written. If it is 'morality' that Bennett is concerned with why doesn't he investigate the moral conduct of the likes of Gingrich and Mr Hyde - to start with. If the President is to set good moral example
1, An argument that needed to be made
0, important to read critically: Mr. Bennett's concern about the president's moral decay is hypocritical--he is simply a point man for the Republicans. He harks back to Watergate
1, Well stated arguements. Sound observations: Bill Clinton has decimated our constitutoin and violated the public trust in the office of president. All the while
0, Pure Bennett!: Bennett is brilliant
0, Most Boring Beatle Video Ever: I don't want to be mean BUT.. I spent my hard-earned money on this thing and it's horribly boring. This video does not include your interest regarding the subject; it should be better. Save your money and buy the Pete Best Beatle video or an All Starr DVD instead. Profoundly disappointing.
0, a girl and her toys: first off
0, Dreadful; Basinger Squeals Throughout: This is just dreadful. I used to like Kim Basinger. Perhaps this is another example of women over a certain age in Hollywood not getting offered good parts. This one is about as bad as it gets. First she starts out with a husband who is abusive and then when she goes Christmas shopping
0, Wow - Horrible !: When I saw the price of $6.99 for a blu-ray movie I thought how bad could it be? Well I found out. Everything about this movie was terrible! Save your money for a burger or something.
0, How a toolbox can save your life and end others: While She Was Out could have been really good
0, You will NOT get the globe pictured here.: This globe was cheap. It will help you point out where countries are to your child. Other than that
0, Jittery still images: I bought this item in May. First exchanged it and then returned it. My problem was jittery (shaky) images while watching a still picture and some animated movies (like South Park). The other problem mentioned in the other reviews about remote control is fixed now. You need to download the patch by use of a computer.It's a shame that an otherwise great product has a lot of bugs in it.
1, Sermons from Germany!: (from the back cover of the book) First delivered from the pulpit
1, excellent anime: Loved the anime
0, Will not open!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY: This is a very fun game and a great overall plot. It WILL NOT OPEN. I installed this game on a fairly new HP computer with a brand new graphics and sound card and plenty of memory. It opened the first two times and now it wont open at all. I tryed clicking on the icon and tried start and right clicking but it just wont work. Please Dont Waste Your Money.
0, Not good: I hated Zoo tycoon 2. I got the first zoo tycoon and LOVED it so i decided to get zoo tycoon 2 and i hated it. First one is WAY better. I wouldnt suggest this.
0, Beware high end gamers on Win 7: I bought this game
0, Sample before you purchase: Thin viscosity lube much like water. Dries rapidly after application. I strongly do not recommend this product. Its cost far exceeds other silicon lubes that outperform K-Y.
0, way overpriced: $15 for not even 3 fl oz of this stuff? What an amazing ripoff
1," Synth-pop returns..............with a Vengence: the ""new direction"" that some of the other reviewers are refering to"
0, Horrible: Perhaps one day people will learn not to purchase wasteful books. I cannot imagine the amount of calories people have wasted reading this
1, The piece of paper...: The piece of paper was the drugs! It was the drugs that the kid on the night crew took. That's why he got all weird and took off that night. The piece of paper illustrated that there was no connection between Harper's son and the kid (Jason?) on the night crew who got whacked. True
1, Fantastic!: I've seen Celtic Thunder in person
1, Love the guys!!!: My 95 yo mother loves watching these guys. The music is good
0, very disappointed: Take Me HomeI pre ordered both the DVD and CD before they were released because we are enthralled with this group. My whole family was disappointed with the quality of this DVD--the camera angles
1, Tastes from around the world in the age-old clay-pot: The recipes collected are representative of ancient cooking from many cultures. Traditional clay-pots from each culture are described. Each recipe has detailed
1, Super Perfect Cell: This is a great DVD
1, THE BEST TAPE ANYONE MAKES!!!!!!!!: THIS TAPE IS THE BEST TAPE! IT WON'T TEAR ON YOU 
1, Better than Scotch!!!: This is the only tape I will use for wrapping packages that I sell on eBay. No picking at the corners anymore! Strong
0, Do NOT Buy if Buying to Cover Labels for Mailing: I run a business where I use a Dymo label printer. I ship out packages and put said label on the package which is simply a mailing cardbox box. Specifically USPS flat rate boxes.This tape
1, STICK IT....: Great tape..Easy to use adheres quickly and easily.The size is great for packing boxes for mailing or moving.Does not tangle
0," ""Everyone"" stay away from this movie!!!: Horrible"
0, a waste of time: This movie was confusing and pointless. The plot jumped around
0, Freedomland gets the Boot.: This movie wasn't as grand or as groundbreaking as I thought it would be or supposedly heard. Yes
0, A mess and aggravating to watch: This movie was simply aggravating to watch.There was never any sympathy for the characters and in fact Moores character was simply irritating.As for the supposed surprise ending.... WHAT SURPRISE ?The whole storyline is clearly laid out in the first 10 minutes.... after that we sit thru an exaggerated backdrop of a ghetto racial tension and endless rambling from Moore's character jsut waiting for the end to some that we know is coming anyway.
1," The Foundling by J. R. Kinser: This book is a ""quasi-thriller"" fictionalized accountbased on a worse case scenerio of not only the moralbut the legal implications surrounding fetal cell research.The reader is caught up in the possible dark side of themedical research field using fetal cells to achieve whatmany rationalize as ""The ends justify the means"""
1, Dinasaur BBQ: Haven't tried any recipes yet but I will surely put it to use this spring. Looks like some good recipes in there. I would say well worth the money.
1, A Good Substitute for the Restaurant: My husband and I used to go to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse when I was in graduate school there. It's one of the only things I miss about Syracuse. We were given a copy of the cookbook as a wedding gift
1, Awesome! A Total must have!: I own all of the Zoo Tycoon games. I couldn't wait for Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine mania to come out. On the day it came out
0, ICO...: This game was wonderful to play all the way through. The puzzles keep you thinking yet they don't get in your way. The game play seems fluid and none of the puzzles seem contrived or forced. The fighting is fun. The landscape is stunning. I am glad to own this game even thogh I don't think I will probably play it again this year.
1," Good game...but hard.: ""Ico"" is good and all"
0, Didn't work: I've had 2 PS2's so far and none of the blue discs seem to play in them. The first PS2 I had I tried to play tribes that didn't work. Then my second PS2 I tried to play ICO. The graphics were good i'll give you that
0, Promising game
0, WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED: This game sucked so bad. It was such a waste of my money. The story was stupid. The commands didn't even work. None of it even made sense. I couldn't even get it to do easy normal commands in the first level
1, Chauncey Gardiner is a character that I will never forget.: As I read the story
1, wall ironing board: This ironing board is great if you are trying to save space. It folds up on the wall. When folded down to use
1, A sensitive story about a battle against ignorance.: My first novel by Pat Conroy. I was really intrigued by this piece of work and I'm not sure exactly why. I guess in thinking back that perhaps that it was simply a well-written novel. Conroy has a fine way with words and a real feel for the plight of people. As a teacher
1, Just what you would expect from Pat Conroy - excellence: This book is superb from cover to cover. Conroy's story
1, Wonderfully written...: Great read
1, yes
0," Fey fo fum: I guess i am one of the few that was looking for more of the ""merry"" fey type and MORE of that story line than trying to get historical data. It was a nice read but I am Glad it was a free download since i wouldn't want to pay for it. Not a book to read 2x."
1," This book has become my ""Acting"" bible.: The first two sections of the book alone increased my abilities in front of the camera 100%. It became that I would read it over each week on my way to acting class. Tony Barr examines all areas of acting"
1, Excellent for live actors as well: I'm a community theatre director and recommend this book to my good actors who want to take their performance ability to the next level.
1, it helped me sooo much: im 14 and am on my way to being an actress......hopefully. I just bought this book and it is very useful. It tells you a great deal on things that you need to know. it is the most brilliant book that i am reading that teaches u about acting for the camera. And if anyone here knows of any acting schools in hong kong can they leave a msg here. thanx for reading this
1, The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting: The mystery
0, Good Product Advice
1, Great stories!: I've lived in South Carolina most of my life and never heard many of these stories. I love 'Sunset Lodge' and 'Murder at Cape Romain'! Great accompanying photos and sketches.
1," The All-American Rejects Rock!!!: This is a great album because the lyrics and music are very good and Tyson Ritter is hot. And I just love the all the songs which is surprising because most cds I buy I only like a few songs. And on this cd I can't even think of a favorite song on the album except for maybe these 3 songs ""My Paper Heart"""
1, Wow: When I ahd first heard of the band I didnt now what to think I just thought is was another wannabe band But when I was able to buy there new Cd and listen to what it was all about i was blown away by how much i liked it later on that month i went to there concert but all together this was an alsome Cd that is headed to the top
0, 1 word..AMAZING!: This CD is amazing.. i first heard my paper heart and totaly loved it...i bought this CD about 3 months ago..there's not 1 bad song on this CD...you will be extremely happy if you buy this CD!
1, AAR is the BEST OF THE BEST!: The All American Rejects are from Stillwater Oklahoma and this band knows their stuff. If you are the type of punk rocker this CD is for you! Different songs that have an AWESOME beat! This band is known for their most popular song
0, *NSYNC at level 2: The All American Rejects are basically *NSYNC pushed to the new level.This isn't really a bad thing though but they are just lacking anything original.They're songs are also repetive in lyrics.Each song is just another heart broken rhyme after another and it gets really really boring after a short time.The songs are somewhat catchy for hardcore or casual pop fans though.I'm just not a huge pop fan but this is a decent effort for pop at least.
0, don't bother buying...download first: I heard the first single
0, BAD BAD: THE ALL AMERICAN REJECTS. THE WORST BAND IN THE WORLD. INSTEAD OF THIS BUY ST ANGER THE METALLICA CD THE KINGS OF HEAVY METAL INSTEAD OF THE QUEENS OF SOFT PILLOW REJECTS ALL AMERICAN REJECTS I MEAN!

0, dont campare em to *nsync: Nsync is better any day than these poseurs.i hate these guys.After buying this record i thought it might be kool because i heard they are like *nsync and well yeah they are kinda like *nsync with guitars BUT THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD.If you want some good music
1, WONDERFUL!: All i have to say is AMAZING this CD was wonderful it is definetly a lift me up CD all the songs are great and that normally doesnt happen. Most of the time i buy a Cd and some songs are always not as good
0, Ehh: These guys are alright. They'd be better if the lead singer didn't sound like he was getting kicked in the balls everytime he hits a note
0, Not for NiCad: This device WILL NOT charge NiCad batteries such as those furnished with solar lights. It will give a RED error code. This is only for Nickel Metal Hydride NI MH batteries.
1, Great Accessory for devilish outfit: The pitchfork is just the right accessory to make your outfit look sexy and devilishly fun.
0, I'm an idiot!: I already have the cd with this song on it..this is only one song played 4 different ways..It came fast in the mail and has no problems. But I don't need it.
0, Cool anectodes but fairly useless for learning driving techniques: I've read a lot of books about Performance driving/racing techniques lately and I have to say that this one pretty much ranks at the bottom.It is a well written biography about Bondurants life (a whole chapter in the book
1, Quick and fine: Shipped the next day via mail. Received a week later. Thought the mail would be quicker but what can you do. Watch an episode a day while working out and so far so good. All the disks look fine. I would buy from this vendor again.
1, Perfect invention: This humidifier is so awesome! It's as cute as it shows on the website
1, Excellent Buy: First of all
0, Short Life Span: It's adorable and works great! I used it mostly at night when I sleep. However
0, Crane Cow Humidifier: We were excited to set up the Cow Humidifier in our grandson's room. After following the instructions and getting it operating
0, Very disappointed: I got this humidifier after our Vick's died. I thought this frog was cute and I liked it didn't need a filter. After 2 nights of using it when my daughter was sick
1, Works Fine: The Crane Dragon works fine for us. No problems so far. My only complaint is that this thing looks like a Dinosaur or a Lizard
0, Maintenance is a pain: The manufacturer recommends emptying the humidifier daily. While there is a removable water tank on top
1, So good
0, Worst!: After only 3 weeks of use the unit started leaking all over the place. I can't even return it now so I am stuck - beware!
0, noisy in 2 years: broken in 2 years with rarely usage. very noisy from the fan. something was broken inside. a lot of white dust at the entry of vent. The other one has no problem. I think the duck one has quality issues from manufacture.
1, Cute and easy to use.: This is quite easy to use
0, ok for small room: It is adorable
0, I really wanted to love this
0, Works great
1, GREAT BUY: We had several humidifiers over the past years warm mist where the filters need to be changed and the cool mist (vicks ) which is the heaviest when filled with water .Then after several research online found that there is no difference if it is cool or warm mist as the air will be the same temperature when it reaches the lungs ...so why pay for warm mist when cool mist can do the same job .These humidifiers are not expensive and works great .They look like decorative pieces and works great .We are totally happy with the product and we have fewer nose congestions and colds ...It is less expensive in Amazon and they carry several crane models.Would def recommend this product ....
1, Much better than my old humidifier!: Cute design and super quiet. My old humidifier was so loud you could hear it from downstairs when it was running in an upstairs bedroom. This one is so quiet you barely know it's on when you are standing right next to it. The on light is not very bright so it doesn't interfere with sleep. The dial allows you to adjust exactly the amount of mist you want. My only complaint is that after you clean it it takes a couple of days to completely dry out. But
1, Still running after 3 winters!: I had the Crane penguin and it died after exactly one winter--the bowl cracked first and then the motor itself stopped running. This little piggy on the other hand has never given me any problems. And I find it relatively easy to keep clean. My grandma has had the same model even longer than me and hers is still chugging along too.
0, Defective out of the box: Bought one two years ago
0, One worked for 6 weeks
0, Deceptive Duck = Defective Duck: ..or shall I rather say
1, Does the job
1, works great: Functions very well once you figure out how to load the water and so cute. I have bought this product for two of my friends after receiving one as a gift.
1, Humidifier for my daughter: I love how cute this humidifier is! I'm pleased with how it works
0, Leaks after one month: This product worked great in the beginning
0, Inconsistent: Needing something to combat the dry heat of my apartment this winter
0, Did not last too long: I have had the penguin humidifier for a year and it stopped working already.What a waste of money.It leaks a lot and the red light always comes on which means there is something wrong with it.Do not buy the penguin humidifier.
0, LEAKS: This humidifier started to leak shortly after purchase
0, Broke in 2 weeks: It just stopped working after 2 weeks
0," Broken and VERY Poor ""Customer Service"": This penguin while quite adorable"
0, worked at first: When i first bought this product it was great now it won't turn on and its only few mths old. I don't have receipt so can not return it just stuck with a broken humidifier.
0, Works only if you're within 2-3 feet of it: You literally have to be right next to it to make any difference. Wish I would have bought a real humidifier. This is more of a toy...
0, I got a broken item
1, Pretty cute and effective: I bought this humidifier for my son who has extremely dry skin and developed a dry cough at night. Not only is this little guy cute but so easy to operate! It puts out a good amount of mist that can be directed with just a turn of the head. I feel like this was definitely a good investment and plan to buy a different Crane humidifier animal for my daughter's room.
1, Can't do better: Have had it a month. Works fine seems to put a good bit of moisture in the room. Instructions say to clean it every forth use. Seems a bit often.
0, It's cute
1, So cute
0, Try another brand: We purchased this item from a different retailer in January 2011
1, It really helps with my dry nose: I used it for my dry nose sinus. It helps well.All the functions are set.But wish it to be quiet while working.
0," Makes a mess!: Even though super cute this is an extremely poorly made product.""Steam"" blew up in the air and then fell on the floor making a huge mess. Carpet was soaked. Tried moving the humidifier higher up on a dresser but water just settled in same spot right in front of it.I've had other humidifiers before and I could place them on the floor and never had to worry about huge wet spots on the carpet from where the steam fell.I'd suggest another brand."
0, CRANE Thomas the Tank needs to goto SODOR for repair!!!!: As with the reviewer of the Wachsmuth & Krogmann Thomas the Tank Engine
0, Have you ever tried to clean this thing?: Have you ever tried to clean this product.Over time collects mold and build ups and it is impossible to clean it because it has too many hard to reach places!!! It does not spread the mist around either. So you end-up with a wet spot on the floor or the surrounding area.Overall I consider it quiet but hard to clean. I do not like the fact that when you change the water you also have to bring with you a large bowl to throw the water remaining in the base of the humidifier which is ridiculous.I have recently checked if the product was modified. The company has not made any changes on it for the last 3-4 years. I am looking to buy a different kind.
0, BUYER BEWARE!: Shame on me for even considering buying a third. (2 frogs and one elephant.) What can I say...I liked them while they lasted. Stupid
0, So cute. Only worked for 2 months.: I absolutely love penguins & thought this humidifier would look really cute in my daughters room. But it only lasted 2 months before it just quit producing the mist. I took very good care of it but it just doesn't work anymore.
0, terrible: We are on our third defective unit. Crane has been great about replacing them
1, I love the froggie: This product is cute and it does what it promises. You must
0, Not Working in less a day: I like the no filter function
0, broken after a few days: It last about 3-4 days. No mist coming out. Read through the user's manual and it seems to break easily if water gets into a hole at the water basin
0, Looks better than it works...: Maybe I'm just unlucky
0, WHEN it works
0, Don't buy this or any other CRANE product: We purchased two of the adorable 2.1 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier
0, CRANE Ee-8189 ULTRSONIC COOL MIST HUMIDIFIER- OWL
0, CRANE: HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT CRANE!!!! My humidifier cracked and they only said I could order new part. Humidifier is HARD TO CLEAN and also LEAKS!
1, Absolutely love this humifider! So Cute!: This humidifier is so cute. Goes great in my baby's nursery. I like the fact you can adjust the amount of mist. Penguins head turns to change the direction of the mist. Highly recommend. Great value for the price. Unit is super quiet.
0, Just Stopped: I bought this humidifier for my daughter because she desperately wanted a Moo Cow toy and this was so functional and cute. She loved it. I had a basic cone style one from Crane that has lasted for ages so I thought this would be a good buy. Unfortunately it just stopped working over a month ago. No warning sign
0, not as good as it introduced: I got the penguin one. However
0, Broke in less than a week: Cheap plastic
1, Cute but Roomy Frogy at an Affordable Price: The same model has been selling in Korean websites at almost half of the price here. Considering logistics cost and power volt difference
0, Died after about a month: Had to return it after about a month of on and off use because it stopped producing steam. Other than that we liked it a lot--will probably try again.
1, Perfect: I just love the design of this. I bought the pink pig because it was perfect for the color scheme i have in my baby's nursery. This humidifier works great I see an improvement is my baby's skin and breathing already. The only headache about this product is that it has to be placed on a flat elevated surface.......however you should not put it on wood furniture. All I have is wood or wood's cousin furniture so where do i put it?????? For now it's on my glass computer desk .
1, best humidifier: this is the best humidifier i've ever owned. it sctually humidifies the air without making everything wet. i bought it for our new daughter but since she's been in our bedroom i set it up in there. i'm now shopping for another for our living room and one for our bedroom when she moves to her nursery.
0, Bought TWO
1, Works really well but it's a little noisy: Works well and looks cute but is a little noisy. It sounds like water running or gargling noises if set to high. It's quieter on lower settings.
1, quiet
0, Glug
0, Take a BEFORE and AFTER measurement. Here's why...: With so many positive reviews
0, Cute
0," Crane- USA : Very good cutomer service.: Update to my previous comment: They replaced a new one for me after I sent them the warranty card. Very prompt customer service and attention.It works perfect. Worth buying.I received this item today. I checked the item as soon as I received. It does not work. The indicator of humidifier does not get switched ""ON"" and the item seems to produce no mist.I have emailed the service center of crane to see what could be done.Waiting for the reply.A bit disappointed with this product."
1," If only it were more clever: We had the elephant for our boys and needed an additional humidifier now that our 2-yr-old daughter has her own room. I really like that the elephant shoots steam from it's trunk and was hoping that the owl would shoot steam from it's ""ear"" feathers but it just comes from the top of the head. You can't tell from the photos where it will come from.Another difference is that the elephant (an older model) has an on/off switch separate from the knob and the new owl one does not. I would rather it have the switch (very small and in the back) to ensure that it stays off if curious children mess with the knob (in front and visible)"
0, Two Defective SpongeBobs: The first one we bought worked out of the box. My 4 yr old absolutely loved it. After a couple of weeks of use
0, Heed the warnings: We took a risk ordering this item for christmas and didn't heed the warnings. Cute
0, Not really 2.3 Gallon Capacity Tank: As shown in the product page
0, good looking
0, One is broken after a month.: I ordered two together. I ordered this because I have another crane bought 4 years ago. It is still good. However
0, unsafe: inexplicably
0, Broke after 2 weeks
0, Not very impressed: After 2 1/2 years
1, Get it. Rock it. Sing along.: I cannot recommend this album enough. The songwriting
1, An imaginative and poetic work
1, Very nice measure tape: I love that this measure tape is small and has a smooth action. It's very convenient that it has both metric and imperial units. The tape pulls out and rolls back in very smoothly. The lock works just like it should without any issues. The only odd thing is there is no marker at 4ft
0, Good light quality
0, 1 Star for Dietrich Bonhoeffer: The book covers leave something to be desired. He was 1 man trying to save many; I don't appreciate Christian denominations trying to claim him for their agenda. Where were you when a nation of God-fearing Christians supported Hitler?
1, Cost of discipleship: This is a classic from last century that still has power today. Although somewhat Lutheran as one might expect
1, Cost of Discipleship: This book is completely fantastic. I love the way that Bonhoeffer is so passionate about his writing. He clearly has a wonderful and deep love for the Lord. The book was in great condition
1, One of the South's finest: Well written chronicle of one of the South's finest soldiers.Too little has been introduced about the struggle between North and South in the Nations. This book is the best I have read on the subject.Watie and his gallant band are well represented in their struggle to defend their families and save their homes from ruin during the Yankee invasion.
1, Knowing one of the victims: Knowing Kevin(Mark) Ramsey made reading this book very difficult. I thought it was a great book even if I did through it across the room a few times. I like true crime books and this is one of the best I've read.
1, An exciting adventure!: Window on the Past was an extremely enjoyable adventure. The author captured the voice of his characters and let them tell the story. The idea of being able to see into the past was presented in a compelling way... it almost made me wish a flash of lightning would hit one of my televisions.I understand that a sequel is in the works. I ask that Mr. Tanner please hurry. I'm eager for more.
1, Different Story Page Turner: This was different than I usually read and exciting page turner the way I like them. The main character
1, bouncy
0, Deflates significantly every night: This ball is a bad product
1, Excellent book if you're committed to PL/SQL: This book is excellent and the author's proficiency in Oracle/XML is second to none. I like his News Portal and Pager explanations. This is the first book I've seen to talks about the issues when paginating result sets using XML or otherwise. I particularly like his approach to using XML as the model and clearly separating the presentation from the model. He preaches this throughout the book and demonstrates how to do this effectively using XML and XSLT. The one critisim for me as someone who isn't 100% committed to using Oracle is that he makes a lot of use of PL/SQL and Oracle features. I accept this because it's after all a book about writing Oracle XML applications but it takes away from the reusability of his examples for me.
0, not durable: I didn't use this ball very much (twice a week at top)
0, SMELLS TERRIBLE: This ball is probably made of cheap plastic that includes crappy chemicals. It smells sooo bad that it gives me headache. Do not buy it! I am not sure if that odor is healthy to actually breathe.God it is annoying!!!
1, Good price on an exercise/birthing ball: I got this for my partner who is pregnant and she uses it to relieve discomfort. Our birthing center have similar ones that will no doubt be useful during labor. My partner was able to inflate this herself with the included pump
0, Not quit a ball: I am not sure what I expected from the cheapest ball out there. The ball is egg shaped. I used the measuring strap and did not over inflate it. I don't know if this is common or not
0, Size not as described...: The 65cm ball is quite a bit smaller than advertised. I inflated it pretty good and it's still a lot smaller. If you want a true 65cm ball perhaps you should get the bigger size ball. The foot pump is cumbersome to use but if you only have to inflate it once it's not that terrible. The material also has a strong smell
0, Bought 65cm but got 55cm: Ball seemed nice but realized its a 55cm even though I had ordered 65cm. I notice few others have the same issue. I am returning this product.
1, Body Ball: I love the body ball. I bought it for a specific purpose but if you aren't sure how to incorporate the body ball into your workout
0, Low Quality and Pump is a Joke.: This ball took me 5 minutes to inflate using an ELECTRIC pump. You could never inflate it with the pump provided. In addition
0, valeo ball: When i received this item not only did they send me the wrong type of air pump so i could not inflate it; after trying various of other pumps i realized the item was defective
1, Great Ball!: I love this ball! I find that I have to pump it back up after a month or so
0, really BAD ordor/smell
1," Gma Darling: I'm 5' 8"" and I think the ball is too big for me. I'm scared to do the exercises where I need to lay across the ball. Otherwise I love doing exercises on the ball."
1, We Want Everwood: I'd rush home every Monday to watch Everwood
1, Excited!!!!!!!!: This is one of my favorite shows of all time!!!!!! I am very excited to hear that it is coming out with season two soon and more to come I hope!!!!!!!!
1, Best series ever!: Everwood is indeed the most authentic
1, PLEASE RELEASE ALL 4 SEASONS OF EVERWOOD!!!!!!!!!: Everwood is the best television series ever!! I have had season 1 for over a year now and it is awesome!!! Please Warner Bros.
1, WB
1, Everwood. The Complete Second Season: We really injoyed the story
1, nice watch: I am very happy with this watch and it looks great the only promblem i found was that the links keep on poping open
0, Dont buy: This is a very difficult thing to put together I have literally put together real engines easeyer than this the enigine does not go together like a real one nothing fits right and does not make any sense over all it's a pice of crap save your money
0, Revell Big Scale Visible V-8 Engine: I bought this for my grandson's birthday and apparently it was the hit of the day ! As far as I'm told it will be fight between Dad & son as to who gets to actually build it !!!
0, Disappointed in so many little ways: I bought this expecting it would be like the old Revell model I knew as a kid...Alas
0, Horrible: Horrible model. I was really looking forward to this with my son. Very poor quality. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1," Fantastic Artist!: I bought this for the song ""Miracle""... I was very pleased. I had never heard any of the other songs on this CD but I like every one of them. I am 42 and this"
0, Mailing of The Greatest Thing in the World: When I ordered a single copy of The Greatest Thing in the World ( a very slim volume )
1, DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!!!: THIS CD IS GREAT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO DANCE.YOU WON'T BE SHY WITH THIS CD PLAYING.
1, Durable
0, Inauthentic depiction looks Japanese: Viewers in the west may not readily recognize the subtle inauthenticity of this opus. The production is Japanese
1," Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth & Sea: Great cinematopgraphy and tale of the ""blue wolf"" and the changes the khan went through to stay focused when the world's karma was due through war."
1, KitchenAid Can Opener: I really needed a can opener
0, What a let down...: ..just a let down since the first two movies where whimsical and fun.. and in Live Action.Nope
1, Whisper of Death: Quite simply
1, You Create Your World: What happens when what you feel on the inside surfaces out into the real world? What happens when that power is given over to someone who doesn't have your best interests at heart? What happens if you can't get out of that world to regain that power? You'll find yourself asking those questions and answering them by the end of this book. Fiction books have many layers. On the surface Whisper Of Death is just an excellent horror story. It is frightening to think about but just under the surface there is a message. That message is the key to what makes this book excellent. All novels existed somewhere else before they were written just like the characters in this novel find themselves in perils and perdicaments think about yourself in that situation as it applies to your own personal reality.Read and enjoy this book
1, An interesting examination from the Japanese point of view: I wrote a thesis in college about the Japanese seizure of Korea
0, Terrible!: As a fan of Jessica Simpson since her 1st single
0, Please enter a title for your review: The trailer tricked me into watching this. For the first half hour it was pretty cool
1," The first year of the Civil War vividly portrayed.: Catton describes the transformation of the Army of the Potomac from a collection of amateurs into an army of hardened veterans. He particularly brings out the ""loss of innocence"" at Antietam. His description of Antietam will make you shudder in horror. The fury of battle leaps off the pages as no other civil war author can do. Catton gets inside the head of Gen. McClellan and shows how he repeatedly failed to gain the crushing victory that was always just out of reach. I read the book in two sittings and could not put it down. If you can find a copy"
1, A cute movie for little girls: The movie uses many different elements from many different Madeline books. It is cute and represents Madeline accurately.
1, An Amazing Pioneer Missionary: The life of William Carey is a remarkable one. Born in 1767 - he lived until the age 66 passing away in 1834.He was a shoemaker
1, An absolute must: Serious students of Chinese medicine can essentially learn all of Chinese medicine from this single book. It is the single most important English language book currently available on Chinese medicine
1, satisfying journey into the past: I collect womens diaries and memoirs from the Civil War era as well as the pioneer era. This book is a must have for southern plantation buffs. I felt like Laura was personally introducing to each member of her family. The wonderful old photographs add so much to the text. Not sorry I bought this one and it will definitely stay in my collection.
1, KING BACK....YA DAMN RIGHT: This CD/DVD is off the hook man i just got it today it was only one copy of the Limted Edition left I'm glad I got it. T.I. really put it down on this one I have all his cd's and could not wait for this joint ever since i heard he was coming out with KING in January. From 1. King Back to 18. Bankhead I cant stop listening to it all the tracks are hot and T.I.'s flow is still sick his flow gets better with each new cd with ATL in theaters and this CD 2006 is this dudes year 4 real
1, So upon many listens....: Initially
0, it's aight: i like the beats on here&the Production is cool
0, dissapointing: i have all of ti albums from im serious to urban legend and the king is by far the wackest of them all. hes gone to commercial now. his beats and lyrics arent as raw as his albums in the past. i wont buy his new album but im still a fan.
1, This Truly Does Work!: Elemis Aching Muscle Super Soak - Deep Heat Aromatherapy for Sore Muscles 400MLI first tried this product in the Bahamas at a resort. I couldn't finish a Spa massage because my back muscles were too knotted. I was shown this product and I have been buying it ever since. It is pricey
0, has its moments: Too violent
1, Wonderful: I love this book .I am reading it for a biography about him and I think the book is great.
1, Just what we needed: We had an old one from 1978 that finally failed. Found this one. The spring is strong enough even to withstand kids. Our shower is as good as new if not even better now.
1, Excellent!!!: I love this product. Marta Gómez has beautiful voice. She's excellent. This CD has some impeccable musical arrangements. 100% recommended.
1, A little slick of latin heaven (cielo): Her voice is beautiful and music is original. Maybe her lyrics aren't super original (all Spanish) but her voice and music more then make up for it. Another beautiful Colombiana (her voice).
1, really nice book.....: I love this book! Not only does it give you needed info on certain common herbs and directions on how to use it best
1, Astonishing but...: Astonishing work
0," An uninteresting story about unlikeable people doing nothing much in the desert.: This novel centers around a married couple who are supremely selfish and emotionally defective. I guess that makes them ""sophisticated"". Their friend"
0, What's not working. Fine there. The rest is questionable.: Her skepticism on what is not working is right on
1, Good quality for the money: This is an excellent value. Quality is good. The spare rollers are nice and the storage box is super.
1, Individual VS The State: Thoreau holds a strong conviction that we ought not to submit to unjust laws or Government
0, will not work: The software indicates it will work on my computer but it will not install. I do not have a gripe with the seller though. Software was in good condition and in original wrap and I received it in a timely manner. I was just looking forward to having it on my computer as my granddaughter enjoys playing Kids Pix at school.
1, Magnificent!: This is the classic
1, The Lady and the Unicorn: My book club read The Lady and the Unicorn by Tracy Chevalier. It was an enjoyable read and the discussion was lively. We discussed the role of women during that time period
1, Simply Amazing!!!!: this cd of deep dish totally blows my mind away! I dunno how they do it....but they just know how to keep a person moving. Whether your listening to them live or on cd they know how to do it. This cd is a must buy
0, Big disapointment: Hi all i am shocked to see name Deep Dish on this CD
0, A Step Down: These guys are two of my favorites
0, Would not Recommend!!!: I purchased the set six months ago and would not recommend the set to anyone! I have a home improvement company and always thought that Dewalt was one of the better tool manufacturers. The finish nailer has been nothing but problems from the beginning. Dewalt does give you a three year warranty but you have to take the tool to a service center for them to determine if it is a factory defect. My service center was an hour away in the hood! The customer service representative was rude and very unhelpful. I decided to try to fix the gun myself and found the problem very quickly! All of the parts on the inside of the gun are plastic. Need I go on? The gun is in the garbage where it belongs. I will never buy another Dewalt product! I recommend Bosch tools if you want a dependable one!
0, not good: I got this after using a HAI flat iron
1, A Funny Anime Series: This is a great and funny anime if your into the more chibi
0," a smart advertisement: This book is one of the smartest advertisements I've ever seen. Paula rips apart every skincare product (even the products that get an 'approval' from her still have a ""but"" or ""however"" following their praise.) The only skincare line that gets her full backing and lavish review? Her own.If you want reviews on a product"
0, Difficult to Trust Someone Selling Their Own Line of Products: I was very interested in this book until I found out that the author has her own line of products that compete with every other product she critiques.I have used many of the products in her books and completely disagree with most of her comments.I would have a lot more respect for her and her information if she weren't selling her own lines of cosmetics.If Amazon would allow zero stars
1, I'm a Fan of Paula Now: This book has saved me hundreds of dollars. After reading this book
0, Okay for some
1, In an Age of Information Thinking is Life!: Norman Geisler and Ronald Brooks have written a fantastic textbook on how to think using Logic. They dare to focus on students within their own Christian faith
1, Bought for a class: I bought this book for a class to save some money and it worked out perfectly. It was exactly what I needed and I saved a bunch of money instead of going to the bookstore. I actually quite enjoyed the storyline but I'm not sure if I'll keep the book since I doubt I'll read it again. I'm mostly very happy that I saved so much money.
1, passion of artemesia: I had heard this was a good book
0, Sadly Disappointing: Such a letdown after Girl in Hyacinth Blue. This book has none of Girl's poetry or soul. For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre. And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel. It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book. It's not written from the heart.
0, A disappointment: I picked up this book because I had so enjoyed Alexandra LaPierre's novel on the same subject. The book had also received some excellent reviews. However
1, Great live album
1, Buy It!!: This is a great hard-rock CD. Who cares about the cheering? Angus really kicks it on this. Even if you are a middle-aged
0," Another ""Shorted"" Customer: Ordered this to build some speaker cables for our church monitors. Fairly good wire"
0, buyer beware: thumbs down!!! the reason this wire is half the price of other brands
0, These wire don't come in 100 ft spool: I'll second all these previous reviews about these wires don't come in 100 ft per spool. I ordered two 100 ft spools
0, 12' short wire: I bought this 100' wire two rolls one is 12' short & another one 13' short. So totally I lost 25' wires from both rolls
0, Buy another book - not this one: Being new to breakmaking
0, Roberts Rules in Plain English: The book is a decent primer and is certainly more readable than Robert's original book. Of course the original and all of its editions remain an example of very incomprehensible and convoluted language even for its era. However
0, Dont waste your money: I had hoped this book would save me from having to delve into the complete Roberts Rules of Order.Unfortunately it is too basic and does not go into any depth.
0, a painfully laborious read: I was drawn to this book by the illustrations. I had heard of Umberto Eco before
0, This is not good music: Why do people buy this crap. Why i bought it I will never know. This is one of the worst bands i have ever heard in my life.
0, Another boyband?: I don't like this. I give them credit for playing their own instruments and writing their own lyrics
1, What A Pleasant Surprise...: Personally
1, And why (the f**k) is Lindsay being compared to Kelly?: I have heard this album. I will tell you now
1, Beautiful music! She rocks!!!: I love this album! It's so beautiful and it rocks! Keep the awesome work up Lindsay!
1, Livin' La Vida Lohan: La Lohan's sophomore album has definitely proven to be a great career move on her part
0," not that good: This cd has it's good songs but it has more bad songs. I got this cd because I liked Over off her first cd but this cd kind of sucks. There are about 3 songs I like out of all 12. So if your looking for a good cd don't look to Lindsay Lohan's ""A Little More Personal (raw)"""
0, Jealous?: Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others
0, Your kidding me..: u cant honestly compare her to kelly clarkson with a straight face. kelly clarkson can sing..and shes amazing..lindsay lohan is alrite. I'll agree that she's better than hilary duff but thats all im giving her
1, This was a nice effort for a debut cd........: This was Dannys' debut cd and what a great job he did on this first project.He acted like he was an old pro from the very first song. Maybe he was past due at having his chance to shine on a recording.For this cd Danny choose two kinds of music....classical and popular music. I think he did a good job on both kinds of venues. I felt like his song selection was good to great. His performances on each and every song was also good to great.I think one should buy this cd and give it a chance.
1, Klipsch Speakers: I purchased these for my son in law for Christmas. He's been talking about how great they are ever since. I guess he had a problem with one of the mounting brackets
0, Not working: I could not get a sound from this amp. The orange lights lit up but not the green ones
0, What a self-serving LOSER book!: Basically
0, Sad
1, PERFECT BOOK TO HELP YOU GET BACK ON TRACK: If it weren't for this book
0, Don't Waste Your Time On This Garbage: This book is a total waste of paper and time. The cultish undertones and blithering jargon are nothing more than insults to the intelligent reader. If you have money to burn
0, Very Thick
1, Good enough.: Seems like it will last
0, Awful: Rope was hard to adjust. had to get a screwdriver to remove cap. Then adjusted rope to my height and started. Rope got all twisted up and ball-bearing did not spin at all. Threw it away. Only good thing was that it was really inexpensive.
0, piece of garbage: cap ends difficult to remove & even after shoterning with pliers to correct length
0, Valeo Jump Rope Speed: MAy be this rope is for professional
0, ...: Looks like I wasted my money on this. I should've taken 1 of the reviewers advice and not buy it. This jump rope clearly states that it has cancer causing chemical/materials. I was afraid of using it so I threw it away. Oh nevermind
0, This thing Should Be used to Beat people: This is not No Fkin Jump rope this is more like a BELT ! this thing is so Thick that when i will Jump rope with it & it will hit the floor it sound like the floor is about to brake & when it will hit me sometimes it felt like i was a black slave !
1, Jauria = Bitten: Jauria
0, try another brand: I bought this for my daughters birthday and to our dismay there was no ant certificate to send in for our ants. I have tried and tried to contact Uncle Miltons and the line is constantly busy. I am going to return this and purchase another brand.
0," Smoking Rabbit Tabacco Pipe: I was disappointed to read on the third page ""The Smoking of Rabbit Tabacco Pipe"". I realize in the days of Beatrix Potter this may have been ok as part a character sketch but this book was written in 1995"
0, just plain... not good: after hearing mastadon this mastodon that i was expecting something good... This album has little to offer musically and is very mediocre. I am not impressed. The person who made the comparison to St. Anger is dead on here. Luckily
1, To the Aussie who called this death metal......: I hope you know how stupid that makes you. Mastodon is not at all death metal
1, Mastodon show a slightly softer side: First
0, Generically modified: 2 1/2Ambitiously crude hardcore shows proof of relevance beyond the label yet falls back on stereotypes so many times.
1, Best album this year so far: Completely flawless. Heavy and melodic the same time. A huge turn away from the sounds of Remission and their eps. Buy it without thinking or breathing. Why 4 stars you say? Cuz my f**kin DVD skips.
1, They should be renamed MAS TE DAN: Seriously because their albums are the gift that keeps on giving. They get better with every subsequent listen. The first time this music comes through your speakers you become dizzy because of the intensity and constant shifts in tempo but if you let go of the reins and abandon yourself to the rythm you can perceive its true beauty.
0, Jordan: I put two stars because they technically are pens and I'm sure they work
0, Possibly a Perfectly Horrible Text: The circuitous and unsubstantiated pathways in this textbook caused me to drop the class the first time I entered physics. Many chapter questions are not covered clearly enough in the reading
0, Terrible Text: This book is terrible. The sections do not explain or define concepts well. The calculus isnt bad in most sections
0, THE WORST PRODUCT SUPPORT EVER SEEN!!!: I can't use the video capture option
1, Best of the Best: I've been using this software for about a month now and really like the burning disc features. I decided to get a dual layer dvd burner so I can fit more on one disk. The manual says that you can fit 80 hours of music on a dvd music disc. So far I'm up to 60 hours on one dvd and still counting. Without the id tags though I wouldn't want that much music in one place. Roxio had the foresight to put in the auto id tagging.I also plugged in my camcorder and transferred footage directly to a disk with this software. I don't need the manufacturer's camcorder software now. This program takes care of the video mgmt. I even added some background music. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed with this program. The menus and assistants couldn't be any better.
0, Stay away from Version 8.0!!: All of the positive reviews here must be from a previous version of Roxio's Easy Media Creator -- Version 7.5 or below. I was very satisfied with the two previous versions. However
0, Works ok but interferes with other programs: While I have not had any problem with the suite itself
0, The positive reviews are from Roxio who want you to buy their product: Believe the bad review
0, Complete Waste of Money and Time: This software has major problems - any time I opened any Roxio function
0, Remove this product and restore from a good backup: Roxio 7 was not the greatest product
0, Some of the worst service I have ever experienced: I could only recommend this product and company to my worst enemies and then I would still feel guilty. Their idea of technical support is either $35 a phone call or a website that does not appear to work in any way shape or form. I feel sorry for anyone going to purchase this product and plan on returning my one unfortunate copy and my earliest possible moment.
0, Terrible Product: This product isn't even worth reviewing except to say it is : 1)Unstable; 2) Non-intuitive; 3) A horrendous waste of money.Stay far
0, Doesn't work with my video capture card
0, These sucks!: I thought the shoes were adorable but one broke the first day I used them. Major bummer!!!
1, T6500: Fits my USP Tactical with TLR-4 perfectly. Easily snaps closed with pistol halfcocked. Threaded barrel does not protrude trough bottom of holster.
0, I want my 86 minutes back: I have a sick sense of humor and love a dirty joke
0, heres amovie you wanta see: people inthis documentary have to be so rude and gross with there humor will any rebview you wonna know they are wrong if peole want to see this the they should not because this a waste of money and time it wont have the kind of stuff you heard about like this movie is really disgusting but its not its just bores people on a joke that doesent act like a joke just people tring to be slang and crude and dumb but they arent there acting like idiots starring inthis aand so dos paul provenza and gilbert gottfried buit this shows a different kind of scene from south park tghat will probably be the funniest thing in the movie for any of you that are a big fanof south p[ark but not then thats the only scene youll like in the movie
1, tinkled in my pants hilarious!: Ok
0, Disgusting
1," Hilarious: This movie is the most hilarious thing that I've ever seen - while there are some parts that are a little ""chopped up"" for the lack of a better term. What I mean is that some of the renditions of the joke are not complete"
0, I just don't get it: As a big fan of some off-color comics (Don Rickles
1, The Aristocrat of all jokes: This guy goes to the amazon movie review site because he sincerely believes he has a great movie review he wants to share. He is asked to rate the movie and enter his review. He does so. His review is about a movie which highlights a joke shared among comedians who try to one-up themselves with outrageous descriptions of the most grotesque and despicable acts of sodomy
1, Trek Is Alive and Well: I hated to see this one end. I cut my teeth on Star Trek
1, Fascinating: Good condition when received
1, Great reboot: I can't say enough good things about this movie. It makes me laugh so hard and it's one that even though we own it
0, BOYCOTT THIS FRANCHISE: It is my opinion that this is hands down
1, Fantastic!: I did not think it possible but they did it! Star Trek 2009 kept the original themes and styles while bringing the Trek into the 21st century. I was thoroughly entertained. The group of people that went with me to see this movie at the IMAX was a mixture of ages from teenagers to senior citizens. We all loved this movie. Best flick of 2009 so far.
0, Wanted My Money Back: I went in with an open mind
0, Marginally better than V: At least it wasn't the worst Star Trek movie ever made. The characters were so unlike anything else in the Star Trek universe. And why would someone be driving a vehicle made hundreds of years before they were born?
1, star treck 2009: For any true follower of the Star Treck Series this is a must see. I saw it three times at the movies
1," Perhaps the Best Trek Movie: Definitely one of the best ""re-imaginings"" of a past series of movies"
1, movie: Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition) tough one
0, Wha-?: Unbelievably stupid & disorganized.We stopped the movie about 35-40 mins in.I can't remember the last time my family and I couldn't finish a movie--highly rare.
1, Total excitement!: Great movie! I love how it created a background to a few of our favorite characters. The action is awesome as well!
1, Captain on the bridge!: I don't have much to add to the many excellent reviews of this film other than this: I am now 58 yrs old; when I was 14
1, Star Trek: I loved this movie! We saw Star Trek at the theatre and had to have the movie to watch at home. I grew up watching the Star Trek series as reruns after school. The movie happened whenKirk and Spock joined Star Fleet. The actor who portrayed Spock did a great job! It was fun to see all the characters as they supposedly looked in their twenties. The outtakes are fun to watch too. Special effects are FANTASTIC ! Great Prices at AMAZON
0, i thought it would be bad but wow.: I cant think of anything I liked about this movie. Nothing was done at a high level.
1, Nice Movie: Sums up the how & why Spock & Kirk met and has a super great storyline. Nice to go back in time & see how everything happened..
0, Was this Star Trek?: This is hard for me to write. If I watched this movie and knew nothing about Star Trek I would say it was a good movie. Having any knowledge at all and being a huge fan of the series I can no longer make that statement.Do not read more if you plan on watching this movie and do not want to know more.I did not mind the alternate time line but it was so made just to please the hollywood crowd. I have to give it a low rating. Maybe they will make a second and actually try to remember what Star Trek and the original characters were all about. Kirk was not a screw up
0, Weak Sauce: Sadly this is Hollywood these days
1, for those of us who watched the original series
0, Wanted to like it: I really wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed. What finally got to me was all of the unlikly and unbelivable coincidences which result in J.T. Kirk being at the helm of the Enterprise.
0," The title is ""Star Trek"" so it MUST be wonderful!: If you like video games and CGI's this movie is a 10. However if you are greedy enough to want more from script and direction then altered personalities"
1, Loved it
1, STAR TREK Blu-Ray Movie 2009: STAR TREK Blu-Ray Movie 2009 was GREAT ! LOVED it when we saw it in the movie theatre. Had to buy in on Blu-Ray as soon as it came out. Story line seemed good
1, Excellent service!!!: I was talking to my son-in-law who wanted to but had never seen the movie. I thought to myself
0, Awful.: Awful. Shiny
0, Why bother re-booting the original?: I just don't see the point of re-booting the series with new versions of the original characters - especially since the original Star Trek TOS is being updated on Blu-Ray now - showing everybody just how good it was.If they wanted to do something different with ST - why not start with an all new crew. Then they wouldnt be compared to anybody and they could do what they like with the characters. If they wanted something from Roddenberry
0, too simple
0, Not for me!: My husband bought this book to help me out and all it did was confuse me. I really don't like the layout at all. I wouldn't recommend this for a first time parent. It has allergy-pron foods listed for babies before one year of age. I would go so far as to say this book is unsafe. I'm actually thinking of telling my husband to return it.
1, Thorough but somewhat dry: A very well-researched book
1, IT'S ONLY ME
1," Bought it for the rerouting feature that older version did not have: I enjoy using this product on long trips when I want a larger screen to navigate. I used this on my trips from Philadelphia to Niagra Falls and Philadelphia to Washington DC without any problems. I will say that the gps would sometimes not be recognized or at least pick up a signal sometimes when running the application so I had to restart the application and sometimes my laptop for it to work. Not sure if that was just my computer but just reporting that it happened while using. I like how easy it is to use and you can see lots of roads around you and not just what a small gps only unit would show. I like the fuel calculating feature and the speed display on the unit as well. Very happy with purchase because it is inexpensive and great to navigate from a 14 inch laptop screen than a 5"" GPS."
0, Couldn't get it to load...: I had great hopes for this product
0, good shipping
1, Mr.Deeds: Mr.Deeds is about a guy named long fellow Deeds(Adam Sandler).Who works and lives in a small town.But then goes to the big city New York CITY to get 40 billion dollors from an uncle who passes away.And lives in a mansion with a strange butler who sneaks up on you.Deeds falls in love with a school nurse.The school nurse really is a reaporter.She reports about his crazy behaviors as a rich man.I think it is a great and funny and funny movie.Adam Sandler does a good job for the character long fellow Deeds.I recommend this movie to people who like a good comedy.Another recommendation is for people who are 13 years or older because it is raded pg-13.People who love Adam Sandler will love the movie Mr.Deeds.
1, Very funny: This is a great Adam Sandler movie. Based on the 1936 Frank Capra movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. The original was good in its own way
1, Archival DVD's: So far so good! I am using these dvd's to back-up all of my family digital photos
1, Fun
1, Good quality and easy install: Installed on my front door and looks nice and has a solid feel. The bottom of the handle has a screw that goes all the way through which is different than many I have seen. They give you a plug to cover the screw head on the inside which some people may not like.
0, Looking for Definitive Reagan material? This isn't it!: I've been trying to figure out the most cost-effective way to get my hands on as much good Reagan stuff as possible. I shyed away from the expensive 4-vol video set and got two volumes of this CD series
1, Excellent Book - But Full of Typos: I agree with all the positive comments on this book. It's really great. But there are *many* typos on the book. Sometimes
0, Not his best album: In comparison to his other albums
0, He really need to escape for a while: I purchased almost all Robbie's albums and DVDs
1, Wake Up America!!! Long live Robbie WIlliams!: I have been a fan of Robbie's since i saw his Slane Castle concert televised 3 years ago. He is an amazing performer and song writer. Give this cd a try! It is incredible. His tongue in cheek lyrics on Monsoon and World's Most Handsome Man are typical Robbie. PLEASE
1, A wonderful escape!: I have to confess that apart from Something Stupid with Nicole Kidman
0, Sad to be a Robbie Fan: I cannot beleive Robbie would be so concern about hisimage
1, Play that Funky music???: Is play that funky music on the cd??? I really want the cd 
1, It Shows the true meaning of Best Friends: I have read a lot of novels
1, The book was hilarious!: This book had me cracking up. Both characters were a mess in good way. This is one of those book that you don't want to put down because you're dying to know whats happening next. Need a laugh
1, A Definate Must Read
1, Remarkably detailed and involving: This is a top rate book. The interviews with actual participants in the Korean War make the conflict personal and real. Most interesting are the conversations with the Chinese. Max Hasting's coverage of the 3rd People's Liberation Army involvement in the war is very well done. Between the depth of the coverage of the 1950-51 winter campaign and the intensity of the personal interviews
1, great watch: I gave it to my husband as a wedding gift. He loves it and his friends drooled over it. I was between this watch and the Sturhling ascot watch but I decided went with what I thought seemed better quality plus this one has a second hand and the date. Its a really nice looking watch. The only thing that in my opinion would make it better would be if the face was more thin. But its a great buy for such a stylish watch.
1, They're Pink & They Work: These are well made. But seriously
0, Less than the basic...: This dictionary is poor indeed. To make it plain
1, Amazing: Tyler is such an amazing artist. On January 15
1, Great Album: This really is a great CD
0, It's ok.....: This is not the best cd
1, finally!!: the cd finally comes out today!! everybody get it!! its a great album with a variety of songs from slow to fast... i love all the songs and the extra stuff on the cd. some of my favs include...our time...pink and black...kiss on...you
1, Go get this CD...Now...I'm Waiting...Why are you still here?: I just bought this CD and I'm kicking myself for not getting it sooner...Tyler's voice and songwriting is so awesome...I love the CD and every single song on it. Usually when I get a CD I skip over some songs or just listen to the one that I actually know but with this CD even if I didn't know the song I still had to listen...it's infectious.
1, Kiss on me: This song is so perfect. Its so cute and fun. It is so perfect for teens. His whole album is amazing. If you have a chance to see him live take it!
1, A short but sweet collection of Poems: Released in 1980 and published in Australia
1, Quick and Reliable: The order was completed and received in a very short period of time. This was a great experience. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1, Well pleased: The package was on time and in great shape - Everything was just as they promised it would be .
1, Research Project on Slavery: If you did a research project on slavery
1, A man who led the way for others: Amos Fortune was born At-mun
0, Outdated and not very helpful: As several other reviewers have mentioned
1," ****&#65533; - AC/DC's best album of the Bon Scott-era: ""Back In Black"" remains AC/DC's best and by far most succesful record"
1," Simply the Best: This is the album (CD) that made me an AC/DC fan forever. Driving around in a 69 Ford Torino listening to ""Touch too Much"" was much too much. Bon Scott's voice will live forever!"
0, Foreigner and Dire Straits are billions better..................: AC/DC are just as bad as Nirvana. Bon Scott sings so horribly
0, The final album with Bon.: This was AC/DC's most popular album w. Bon Scott. It has a few decent licks but other then that isn't as good as previous or later releases.
0, ZERO STARS...WHAT A JOKE.: AC/DC are one of the worst bands along with the Beatles. THEY HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING DECENT. THEY ARE JUST OVERRATED...HIGHWAY TO HELL IS ONE LOUSY ALBUM THAT CONTAINSJOKES LIKE GIRLS GOT RHYTHM
0, Poor production/ waste of money: This one of the first time I heard Bon Scot Sing. I grew up listing to AC/DC with Brian Johnson who is one of my favoirite rock singers.Well the first thing I noticed was Bon Scot's singing. Or what passed for it. On the first song. He sounded so wasted he was slurring some of lyrics.On High way to Hell.The other songs were a little bit better. I saying this because the producer did a poor job the band sounded like a buch of amitures.This CD was such a waste.I recomed any one of their albums with Bon Scot
0, Not exactly BAD
0, Won't Last: I used it for awhile without incident... But in about 3 months the joints that screw in would unscrew while walking around (which sometimes created messy situations) and in less than 6 months the wooden handle broke off on one piece. I carried on with the shorter handle for a couple of weeks until the other handle broke off! I think the joints in the middle only make the product weaker. The less often you have to touch it the better!
1, Country Great: Hank Locklin unique voice was made for great country music and many are country classics. This Country Legends album has all Hanks' best.
1, Great: I like this product
0, Lasted 4 months: I also read a positive review in CNET and bought this - it started being flaky after about 2 months
0," A disappointing ""sequel"".: Cannot compare to the original. A forgettable soundtrack"
1, Perhaps the Penultimate: This is a wonderful interpretation of O'Neill's transcendental autobiographical work. The cast is fine
1, entertaining!: entertaining. humerous. interesting stories and good problem-solving. We enjoy the 1900 background (set up) for the story. Characters are fun and the acting is very good.
1, Murdoch Mysteries
0, Poor Quality: I received the product and the quality is unbelievably poor. The bamboo slats on the scale surface were misaligned
1, Intense experience
1," Nice Quality Picture: I bought this on sale for 164.00 during Thanksgiving last year. For that price this is an awesome 22"" monitor. Colors are nice as well the blacks."
0, There is a way to fix this moniter!: My husband bought out moniter after Christmas in 2008. For the past several months it too has been taking forever to turn on. I did have problems with it randomly shutting off
0, My monitor is already going: Less than a year after buying this monitor
0, COMPLETELY DISSAPOINTING: The first movie was surprisingly good; the second suprisingly bad. The first one had one of the most beatiful leading ladies in memory; the second one has you wishing she would simply shut up and quit nagging Zorro. Even the climax
1, Zorro is back
0, Hoover Filter: Only comment is that the filter fits too loosely in the 'mesh' holder. Still works though!Construction seems similar to an OEM. Like having a spare filter and this one is relatively inexpensive.To save $$$ on these filters I blow them out after every use with my shop air compressor!Joe
0, There is nothing like M. Larcange in LONDON PHASE 4 STEREO: I'm sorry
0, buyer beware: A few good ideas are in here but ultimately it is unrealistic if you want to make a quality film. Taken with other how to film books it will do no harm but this will not prepare you for anything but film club type of projects.There are many ways to keep a budget down but most in here only limit the quality ceiling. If you are in this financial catagory - forget film and shoot on consumer or prosumer format and use the experience as a learning tool. Better yet
0, Buyer beware: Put your money in a good gas generator
0," buyer beware: I bought this product in November of last year. After light use (2 power outages) the product stopped working. It now reports ""Error03"" which"
0," Not original recordings: The original recording only issued by Albert Productions contained the track listings:""Baby"
1, Excellent!: One of their best CDs! Great classics from one of the longest running hard rock bands ever. Australian Masters of the Rock Scene.
0, Rather uneven
0, Didn't make much sense.: The acting was awful. I thought
1, a raving revue: This is a great CD for any 311 fan
0, mediocre at best: A fellow Nebraskan
0, Very disappointing ...............: I bought this and 11 other games for my grandson. He tried to play it for 30 minutes and gave up
0, Kitchen Aid Pro six
1, KITCHENAID: I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. THE KITCHENAID PROFFESSIONAL MIXER IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED! IT REALLY LIVES UP TO ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. IT HAS EVERYTHING POWER
1, The best Christmas gift ever!: I was watching an info-mercial on one of the local home shopping channels
0, Trash: I really HATE it when I buy a book thinking it was a new one
1, good read: I read this years ago in paper back. Loved it again in digital format. always a fan of Nora Roberts.
0, Couldn't finish it despite being a true Roberts fan.: Didn't like the man ordering around the woman and not taking no for an answer. Mental abuse is not my thing. Was upset that this was an old book of hers but it wasn't stated as such.
1, enore & more: Not all new material
1," One of their best: I am surprised how many people in this forum think this album is anything less than excellent--especially if they are AC/DC fans. Of course it's not ""Back In Black""; nothing is! This effort is the ultimate in raunchy"
1, Nice simple flat: This is a nice
0, Small pan and edges hard to define.: This pan was about 1/2 of a regular size cake pan and now I know why. It takes forever to decorate. When the cake is baked the outlines you need to follow are very hard to define and you have to use so many different colors of icing that it takes a very long time. If you are going to buy this pan then be prepared to spend about 5 hours decorating something that will be eaten in 5 minutes!
1, Great Cake Pan: The reason for 4 stars is because the number of lightning mcqueen does not bake in to the cake. After numerous tries. But does look like him.
1, Awesome this is the first series I ever read...: And I loved it. I am a sucker for Merlin
1, Illuminated Rumi: I find some of the other rather pedantic reviews a bit troubling. I can
0," Nick Cannon...synonymous for WEAK!!!: What can I say about this?? I only needed to hear two songs to know that this cd would NEVER find it's way into my collection. ""Ya Pops"" and that ""Gigolo"" song are equally awful. Nick Cannon is the corniest actor/wannabe rapper that I have seen in a while.The only thing worse than his music are those globs of saliva that are always in the corners of his mouth.Save your $$$."
0, I THOUGHT IT WAS AJOKE: When I saw Nick Cannon's video for his first single...I really thought it was a joke..then he goes on BET promoting his new album and talking about how great it is! NO WAY...This guy cannot rap and has no charisma whatsoever...he literally has to do the stuidest things in order to get some tv attention...just awful...the lyrics are pretty bad and so is the production
0, Where's Tammy? Where are the clever lines?: I absolutely love this movie... and I loved the music in it
1, My Favorite Book on Rudel!: Printed by Schiffer Publishing
1, Zuma: I am enjoying the game very much and it was in excellant condition. I have always loved this game on the internet on the Pop Cap web site. I am very sastified with the product. Do you happen to have the regular { 1st game } of Zuma? This was Zuma Deluxe I would like to have the original game too.Thanks
1, Six Nonlectures: The nonlectures are titled:i & my parentsi & their soni & selfdiscoveryi & you & isi & now & himi & am & santa claus.A list of readings of works referred to in the text concludes this collection.
1, Thank You Thank You Thank YOU: Since I bought the CD yesterday it has not come out of my player. I have listened to it over and over. It seems that Hidden Beach knows how to pick talent for it's label. Those familiar with the label will not be disappointed with these artists. Their music and lyrics fit so wonderfully together and it's refreshing to hear a man sound like a man and not get caught up in the falsetto like so many other male artists today. The Kindred's voices blend so well together. I know that the comparisons of them to Ashford and Simpson will come and rightly so. If anyone feels that this CD has missed the mark then I will be very surprised.
1, All Good!!: I really do love this CD. One of my favorite songs is Far Away. Everytime I play that song
1, Great Pen~!: The nicest Cross pen I've ever had. This one is a very big and heavy pen. (Larger than most). Great for your home or office. It looks and feels great and it writes excellent.
0, Poor Quality: The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it. The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip. Would not recommend.
0, Big disappointment: I purchased these after reading favorable reviews. These knives are dull
1, Excellent: Outstanding pen
0, Broke within months: The pen ran out of ink within four months of light use. When I attempted to replace the cartridge the mechanism that allows you to twist the pen to expose or retract the point broke
1, A good read: The first of Connelly's Bosch novels smacks of first-time writer. The ending of the novel is directly from several action movies over the past twenty years
1, Connelly brings Bosch's cigarette smoke inside your room.: I finished it in a few days
1, Do yourself a favor: If you haven't met Harry Bosch I envy you because you have 13 of the very best novels you've ever read ahead of you. Michael Connelly is a true master of his craft and in The Black Echo he introduces us to Harry for the first time. Do yourself a favor and buy this book in hardcover because you will want to keep it--after you've passed it around to all your friends.So many crime writers get bogged down in the police procedural aspects of the book. Far from slowing the pace
1, Couldn't put this one down: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For the first book by Connelly
0, Diluted Eau De Toilette: My wife has a nose for scents
0, Hogan's Heroes without the comedy: Well
0," For Beginners only: I bought this book to expand my studies from a ""Windows 95 Registry"" book I previously read. I honestly only browsed the book and found that most of what was in it (besides the authors perception of things) was stuff I knew already from the ""other"" book I read. I tried telling myself I was being arrogant and to give the book a chance but within 3 days I returned the book because it failed to change my mind of my original assessment. Not worth the $50 I paid."
0, Rambling and Incoherent: I've read a lot of Nabokov and finished this one while riding on the Moscow Metro. This is not even close to his best work. It may have been the intention of Nabokov to keep the reader guessing about what was and wasn't real
1, Made me think about my kids: This book can be read in a 10 minutes
0, Poor condition: I wanted to give this book as a gift. The condition made it unsuitable as a present. Too bad
0, Won't Last Longer than Two Years: I've noticed a few positive reviews for the MFC5200C
0," Don't do it: I have owned this MFC for 2 years and would NEVER purchase another Brother .. ever. I use my printer frequently but each time I use this ""piece"" I have to clean the ink heads or white lines appear in the print. Which of course"
0, Stay far
1, Scanning Feature: The only problem that I am having with my MFC 5200-c is the fact that the software that they provide for scanning will not let you scan a document as a PDF File
0, Stay away from this product: Within the first six months we had to replace it twice and it has been the worst experience. I asked them to substitude this product for something else but they said it is not their policy. My advice - get HP and stay away from this product.
1, Fun with Death: I Like Terry Pratchett
1, Soul Music Review: This is another great book from Terry Pratchett
1, Good Information: I bought this book for my daughter and I found myself using it. Great for the teens and the teens in us all.
0, A book full of 30 second sound bites: This book offers very little useful information on rural living other than references for where to get real information. It gives a superficial overview of the many ways you can make a few dollars off of your cottage or hobby farm
1, Great Read: I was very impressed by this book. A book has to have characters that hold you
1, Keep Well Pills!: My husband really likes these vitamins! He works REALLY REALLY LONG Hours! Mostly 12 hours+ a day 7 day work weeks. He swears by them
0, Mario Hoops 3 0n 3: When going back to back to play the game it would not load. After calling Nintendo to see if we where doing something wrong we where not. So they ask us to retun the game to them for Nintendo to look at to see what was wrong. I paid full price for a brand new game that doesn't work. Well I received the game and a letter back and game which stated that the game is a counterfeit. So I think you need to do something about this. I have been a customer of Amozon for years and this really bothers me that you would sell a counterfeit game. Please advise me on how you plan to proceed. I recommend you credit my account soon. If need be I can fax you the letter Nintendo fo America Inc. sent. I hope to here from you soon.ThanksPatti Wohnhasjpwohnhas@aol.com
0, Frustrating.: This game has its moments but it doesn't go far beyond that. With a frustrating AI
1, Great value
1, All Of Me: This is a great collection of music: standard Willie Nelson compositions and even Irving Berling. For a very long time
0, How sweet!: I am really disappointed with most of the cuts in this collection. For example
1, Essential Willie is fantastic: These two CD's take you through Willie's musical career; from the very young
1, Great Willie Nelson Album: Great album of the best known Willie Nelson hits. Loved it and so will my granddaughter who is a Willie Nelson fan.
0, Written in the style of a textbook: Don't pick up this volume with the hope of entertaining reading. Only buy this book if you are doing serious research on Ivan or Russia in the time of the first Tsar. While I stuck with it to the finish (I almost never quit a book)
0, A Big Disappointment.: I was very enthusiastic about getting to this book. I have a degree in Soviet History and wanted to learn more about this character. Like other reviewers
0, This mother sucks: Holy Crap
1, Good Album: After hearing about It Dies Today for awhile
0, Why even buy the book: I read most of it in the book store. He has like maybe 3 good pointers but overall this book is a sham. It should only by about 19.99 to say its even worth it. Hell even VB is more interesting than his writings.
1," Good CD for ""Oh"
0," Incorrect Track Listings: Only 20 of the original ""Motown Story"" tracks are in this. Even though they state there are 58 songs"
1," An anthology of writings concerning cinema theory: Essential Deren is an anthology of writings concerning cinema theory by acclaimed filmmaker Maya Deren. From the poetics of ""Cinema as an Art Form"" to tips on ""Creative Cutting"" to scrutiny of fims in medias res and much more"
1, we've made it to D81: so far my group has been playing for about 15 sessions or so and love the WLD. yes
1, The Girls Next Door
1, awesome
0," Were the TONY voters on crack in 1998?: I have this cd and have seen the show. I have the ""Ragtime"" cd and have seen the show. And I can honestly say that Disney's second musical attempt is more like watching the circus in your hometown than anything else. How can you even compare that to ""Ragtime""? This cd has a few tracks that are worth a second listening (""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"""
1, WOW: This cd is absolutly amazing. I listen to it often. If youv'e seen the play this cd is exactly that.
1, The Lion King: I live in New Orleans and the show is coming here in March for which I have tickets. Not having seen it in NY on one of my trips there I am looking forward to it. However
1, Magnificent!: This soundtrack is phenomenal! I listen to it on the way to work in the mornings to brighten up my day.
0, A good attempt to capture the majesty of an unfortunate hit.: The Lion King is one of the most undeserving SRO shows seen on Broadway in many years. Its book and its score--as evidenced by this mostly soulless CD--are instantly forgettable. The show's incredible
1, Please go buy this CD!!!: If you already have the soundtrack of The Lion King
1, sounds great: Purchased this CD for one of my children as a gift. The quality of the music from the Broadway production is great.
1, Every bit as good as everyone here says: Decided to try this product based on the reviews here. Nothing else seemed to work with our newborn's diaper rash. This stuff has pretty much knocked it out. Also
1, Turbo Touch 360: Got this very quickly and works great! Will be ordering from this company again in the future. Very happy consumer.
1, The first review!: I saw Roses Are Red at a show nearly two years ago with Silverstein when they were under the moniker
0, Phooey !: Unless you have an unending supply of burl wood
1, Large size sandals: They are sturdy
1, Black men sure can jump: This was a very short but interesting book on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I did not know how involved he was in academics before. He has proven that being smart does not block your chances for being a great athlete. Although Kareem has been retired from basketball since 1989
1, An educational and interesting piece: This book really helped me with my report. I learned so much that i did not know about AIDS and HIV releated diseases. Thanks to Josh and Amy i got an A!
0, spanglish: I received this Movie in just a couple of days . Watched it last night 
0, Okay: It was good in the begining but got VERY boring in the end. The whole movie was slow pacing without much excitement. I even fell asleep close to the end!
1, Loved those Latin Divas: The best two movies I've seen in the last year are Spanglish and Sideways
1, A Bonita Surprise: While expecting a fluffy romantic comedy
0, Not as good as it gets...: I was surprised to discover that I really dislike this film. I like James L. Brooks and most of the people involved - including Adam Sandler. The picture starts out good enough - lots of snappy dialogue - but then it takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers: it becomes a tedious
0, Singles shmingles: I honestly feel that this album is terrible. Despite the fact that nearly every cut on the record inevitable became a hit single
1, AC/DC - Back In Black: To say Back In Black is a great C.D. is an understatement. Sure
1, ac\dc: i would like too see ac\dc in live concert i been a fan for long time and i ant seen them at all i would love see them
0, rock and roll ain't noise pollution...: ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio
1, Buy IT !!: That's all you need to do 
1, Just what R&R is all about: With today's Rock music distancing more and more from its roots in the new era of sampled music and souless guitar playing
1, AC/DC PLUS BACK IN BLACK = ROCK-N-ROLL HALL OF FAME!: I have to laugh when I see some of these 'apparent and immature' reviews. How can you give this album/CD 1 Star? First of all
0," 5 STAR album....BOGUS advertising: I am not reviewing the musical content....we all know this is one of the great Rock albums of all time. I am reviewing the NEW release and specifically the VIDEO DOCUMENTARY which they advertise at approx 30 minutes WRONG...its about 21 minutes and on the back of the disc they push IN-Studio performances by Malcolm and Angus Young of ""Hells Bells"
0, acurate and complete but it will seriousely put you to sleep: I read part of chapter 1 and didnt read any more.. extremely dull. Good for reference
1, Indy work at its finest: Sir Reel Films took an indy comic book and brought it to life. Many thanks to the group for putting something fantastic together. Keep an eye on them they are going places.
1, you'll be impressed: For those with even a passing interest in Citroen cars or the company's founder this book will prove educational and fascinating. The Citroen car
1, wrong name: The author's name is not MARK Shaw Findlay...it is MICHAEL Shaw Findlay. Your information does not reflect the correct name.
0, I don't melt when he sings: It's okay for a 10 year old but not a stand out. I don't stop and say
0, disappointed: I bough this for my mom and she told me that the episodes were not complete not only that but one of the dvds was in bad condition
1, The German Lesson: Siggi Jepsen. Schreibt eine Strafarbeit. Über die 'Freuden der Pflicht'. Sein Großwerden in Nordfriesland
1, The New John McNab(s): For those of you who have read the original John Buchan this book is a wonderful treat. It has the same pace as the original and the description of the hills is equally accurate. While it has the same flavour of the original
1, Miss the Minstrel!: This man would have made a magnificent travelling minstrel during the Middle Ages! The song selection by his brother Donal (bless your heart)shows the wide range of talent our Rory could display and the ease with which he could sit in with a vast array of seemingly divergent talent and still shine through with his own proficiency. I mean
1, Excellent!: The final chapter of this book might be the most important thing you will ever read on the believer's ground of assurance. Certain knowledge of one's salvation (justification) is to be based solely in the promise of God and NEVER in good works. This is just as Calvin taught who said in his Institutes of the Christian Religion
1, I loved this book: I really didn't want to like this book
0, case ok: This case is ok. I bought 2 and one came with the zipper not working properly. Also
0, Jstockton: Be aware
0, And still more snake oil: I havne't yet found any supplement that does anything for energy
0, Needs better firmware and intergration with windows: I got this device at a really good price of $115.The storage unit works fine if it is attached to the computer but if you want to really use it as NAS
0, Never good time with foam tan: I have yet to try a foam tanner that spreads well. This left me streaky and was hard to spread because it dried so fast. I now use it on my face only. It was hard to get even on hands and feet without building up orange areas on knuckles and toes. It did give me the same orange tint as most self-tanners I have tried. Not worth the price tag when I get better results from L'Oreal Sublime Bronze.
1, Heavy On Suspense.: Airframe is full of suspense. In scenes were Casey is getting chased around the company
0, Though I'm generally a fan of Michael Crichton...: ...I thought Airframe was pretty lame. 2 stars are for two afternoon's pleasant and quick read through of the first 250 or so pages
0, Information at the expense of character: One thing about a Crichton book
0, Made for TV book: Except for the insider snapshot of the airline/airplane business
0, Not Chricton's Best...: This book was totally lacking in imagination. The characters were underdeveloped
1, A non-stop thriller!: This book is great!I am only 21 years old but this book is still great! It starts with a bang! Somthing goes wrong on a air plane but no one knows what happened. Then people are trying to cover up for it and trying to kill people. The book keeps getting intense as you read it. I recommend it to any one who knows how to read.
0, Good luck with the movie
0, UGH!: After reading this book
0, tedious: It started out great
1, Another great book by Michael Crighton: Upon first reading a brief synopsis of this book
1, Perfect vacation companion: Despite this book's focus on a plane accident
0, Offended by the language: I have been reading Crichton since college and enjoy the research and background he puts into his stories. Fast paced and a good story but I was put off by the profanity. I would not let my teenager read this book nor do I plan to read any other of his newer novels. Very disappointed in Dr. Crichton.
1, One of Crichton's Best: This is a huge redemption for Crichton since the Lost World. It seems he put a lot of time and thought into this one. This gives me a better view on the world of Aviation. I'm a big Crichton fan and I believe this one of his best yet.
1," Airframe: Michael Chrichtons ""Airframe"" is an exciting and mysterious book. The book is about a wide body aircraft that has a slats failure while flying"
1, If you'll get into it
0, This book was BORING and a big disappointment!: I've read all of Crichton's fictional books
1, This book was surprisingly gripping.: I thought I was going to read just another catastrophy book. However
1, Good News and Bad News: I absolutely love the tone and power this small system projects. I've used it for only five months so far. I use it constantly; especially the CD's that I play each morning while walking on my treadmill. Unfortunately
1, Roger Garrelts: I bought this matching set as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of Dahlia
0, Cheap in all aspects: You get what you pay for. This pedometer broke after using it a few times. The clip on the back cracked after attaching it to my thin cotton pants. I glued a strap on it so I could keep using it and 3 days later it stopped counting. It just says 0000 all the time. I only needed something to work for 8 weeks for a contest I am doing and this failed. The same thing happened to the 2nd one I purchased. At least I didn't waste to much money on them.
1, Zen and Japanese Culture: It's been more than a couple of years since i read this but I remember really liking it. It does a great job of opening eyes and minds to Japanese culture (and not just on a personal level
0, Defective Product: The book was misprinted. There were smeared pages and pages that were blank. I didn't discover it until I started reading the book and got to those pages. By then
1, Very Entertaining!: I'm very pleased with this purchase. If you're a fan of the show
0," If you want a shallow discription of current events: If you want a shallow discription of current events in networkingthis is the book. Who wrote those other reviews?What's the book like?"" Key: During the months this ISP has used the laser-based solution"
0, Science Manual: Incorrect book sentPicture is correct but receivedStudent Science Manual with Lab Demonstration ExcercisesSame Title of Science of teh physical creation but not the one orderered and advertisedMBL
1, Cap gets disassembled: Collecting storyarcs featured from the last run of the current volume of Captain America and from Captain America & The Falcon
1, Very Good: This book contains good information including hard to find information related to the subject matter found in but not included in the book Forbidden Archeology.
1, Great Story: Mattie was a great read. I love stories about strong women coming into their own and how they helped shape this country and the West. This book was well worth the $3.49 I paid for it. Buy it; you won't regret it.
0, DISAPPOINTING: I'm disappointed with this album which lacks of originality.I must confess that I hate Christmas
1, Musique de Bois - Outstanding: This album
0, Worked for about an hour: Very disappointing. And their online support sux. The webpage with frequently asked questions wouldn't come up.
1, Best for a child or teen: It's way smaller than the picture suggests. It's too girly-looking for a senior although if it was larger
0, Very disappointing: I was disappointed with this book. There are not many craft ideas that I would attempt with children
0," Horrible Writers: This movie had one of my favorite actresses from Twilight in it that made her very dissapointing to me. The writers of this movie gave her no justice of her talents as an actress. One word for this movie ""HORRIBLE"" and not horror. These writers need to be fired and banned from ever working on another movie again"
0, Discontinued by manufacturer: this should not be offered at all. It is ten years old
1, Wonderful!!: Anne Stuart is my favorite author and the hero's she writes about are the best. She did not disappoint me with her latest PRINCE OF MAGIC. This is a wonderful book and truly enjoyable
1, Excellent Book: This is an excellent book: clear
1, Great snake skin shoe: Very hard to find an Olive shoe and this fits the bill spot on. Its well made and comfortable
0, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK: Oh that I had read the comments from others before I made this purchase. This book is a horrendous photocopy of an illegible 19th century copy of Tennyson's Works. Less than half of the volume's pages can be read. It is completely worthless and should not be foisted upon the consuming public.AMAZON ! ! ! Remove this book from your lists!!!
0, Epson printer: This is a printer that I would avoid. I was very disappointed in the print quality of this printer. There were vertical lines in the printout and overall print quality was poor.. I tried all of the maintenance techniques recommended
0, Oil-free = designed to break down: This deal seemed to good to be true. I've owned 2 of these little units now
1, A Very Good Book: This review concerns the original 1928 edition. Chet and Biff take Biff's new motorboat
1, Great Book!: Written in 1928
0, A botched transcription of an excellent book: This is one of my favorite Lord Peter Wimsey books
0, This is not your old Leisure Suit Larry: One of the first games I played on my PC was Leisure Suit Larry I (and then II and III). These were played with the keyboard
0, horrible at best: bad bad bad bad; want my $3 back; marg sucks in this one and i am a fan. did i mention it was really flipping bad1
0, A Waste of Talent: Margaret Cho has an abundance of energy and charisma. She also has a great ability to tell a joke with proper timing. It's a shame that she wastes these talents on telling crude sex jokes when she could be using her unique position in the world of comedy (as an Asian American woman) to deliver some messages with substance. Clever insights in American daily life
0, Not Like Her Others: I have enjoyed several of Margaret Cho's other appearances
1, Brilliant
1, Pure class by an all round genius !: There is not a single fault with Stephen Jones' song-writing ability. He is the sort of man who twists words into an almost parable-esque form and leaves the listener wondering at the depths of both his mind and his despair. Every title conjures up a new image
0, Mediocre: I am a fan of Placido Domingo...the Opera & Zarzuela Singer...not the Ranchera singer
0, Waste of time and money: If you enjoy doing tedious tasks after installing a huge application
1, This Game has been shut down since 2008 Don't Buy: I can't believe that Amazon is selling this game. This is for an online version that shut down in 2008. If you are buying it as a collector great
0," Wounded Tiger Politics: ""Fat And Proud"" truly made me angry. By using the most worst case scenarios which overweight people could face"
0, outdated: It is recommended that this book receive an update. Of 21 Mail Order Shops that I sent to
0, Gronow's Society Column: One might expect Captain Gronow's memoirs to be predominantly military in nature
1, Works great with Windows Vista: This RF wireless keyboard/mouse combo works great with Windows Vista. I am running the Ultimate edition as a media center and the PC is actually in a different room than the display. The RF signal works really well since there isn't a direct line of site (that an infrared solution would require). I didn't see any delay that I have read about on other vendor's products.The package comes with a USB mouse base that acts as the transmitter for the mouse and keyboard. The base also recharges the mouse's AA batteries (included) via an adapter. The keyboard takes 2 AAA standard batteries (included). Overall
1, Absolute Beginners: There are a number of compilations available - including boxed sets
1, Close to being the real thing: Received my Fireplace DVD and was amazed at how real it not only looks
0, Leaves much to be desired: Unfortunately this book lacks much of the detail and thoroughness that some other guides to the Greek Islands offer (such as the Eyewitness travel guide). Although the major islands are covered in some detail
1, Have been using these for years: I've been using these waxing strips for years and am pleased. Of course
0," This vendor is a Rip Off Artist: This vendor posts misleading adds when confronted to refund money he refused. Vendor not providing 2000 Pre-Waxed strips rather only 8. No where in the add is the number of strips written except for the title of Moujan ""2000 Pre-Waxed Strips"". Moujan 2000 is the name of the manufacturer.Moujan 2000 Pre-Waxed Strips For Body"
0, Not even if it is free would it be a good book!: Having been born and raised in Wyoming
0, Loud screamy voice: So wanted the audio version of her good teachings. Sad to hear the voice of this version is way too screamy and imposing. Sad as the message is interesting.
1, Simply one of the best books I ever read: I first came across this book about five years ago
1, Wonderful CD - even if you don't like the banjo: This a great CD - easy going
0, Very Dissappionted
1, Fantastic.... I Love It!!!!!!!: Why I like it... very interesting stories about how these movies got made and a lot of background information is provided. In particular
0, Joan Rivers Is A Bad Role Model: This book is pure CHUTZPAH. Where does such an unhappy
1," Great album; good for new and old fans: You won't take this out of your cd player for days. Good quality Sufjan at his best. This would be good for newer fans as well; it's a good album to get acquainted with his sound and discover why so many love his music. This has the famous ""John Wayne Gacy"" song that has gained popularity."
1, Boring or Genius: The initial conclusion is one of high production value but
0, Very Over Rated: I consider Illinois by Sufjan Stevens to be the most overrated hipster album of the year. I swear
1, Come feel the hype: And the hype is true. Yes
1, Great: Sufjan Stevens is a bona fide songwriting machine. Stevens released a new album every year from 2003-06
1, There's really nothing like this anywhere
1, Quick & decent: It came pretty fast--my only hangup is the lack of secure holding of the quarters_ the 'pouches' have no flap or other means to keep quarters where you want them
1, Cheesy
1," must read: This is a must read for anyone into true crime. This man was a genius at his ""trade"". I read this shortly after it came out and remember it to this day. It is definitely right up there with In Cold Blood and Helter Skelter."
1, I love praying the scriptures: I absolutely love this book in that it brings all aspect of prayer into my prayer time and keeps me focused in my prayers.
1, Henry IV: I needed this book for a college class. It was shipped quickly and was in great shape when I got it. Also
1, Great Quality: The dress is excellent quality .. (I just toss mine in with everything else when I wash it and the quality hasn't suffered at all)This dress will accentuate your breasts and butt
0, total waste of time!!!: Don't bother with this sucky movie!!!Story line was awful! To many different themes going on.
0, BAD BAD BAD: If I could give lower than 1 star
0, House not to be confused with House with Richard Moll Another Horror Movie.: I thought the movie had a cliched plot
0, Scary and Creepy!: This movie is one I thought I might like because I read the book and liked it very much. I quit watching halfway through. It was boring and creepy. Even though I had read the book I had a hard time trying to follow the plot. Dekker and Peretti are a great writing team but the movie industry did not do justice to this novel
1, Best of the best of Abraham-Hicks: The Abraham sessions are the clearest & best exposition of the Abraham teachings I have heard. I enjoyed meeting Jerry & Esther Hicks as they are for an extended interview. And I loved the music & cinematography that made this a wonderful
0, Left me disgusted: I will be short. I actually liked the first book. New author for me
1, Incredible and joyful early music: Anyone who likes renaissance dance music will love this disk. The group is superb
1, I Love The Low Life.: I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon
1, good system: I had a good experience with cybertron. I was confused with the product that I purchased
1," Great toy for puppy: Our Catahoula puppy loves this toy and we love to use it to wear out his energetic little body. He has been chasing and retrieving it for 4 weeks now and it is still in really good shape. He is 12 weeks old now. We do not let him chew on it because it will not hold up to that. This gave us the frequent opportunity to practice the ""drop it"" command. Our pup loves it and it is his favorite outside toy. He especially enjoys heading at it in a flat out run and try to scoop it off the ground to bring back. Overall a great toy"
0, numbers don't add up: I spent a few days learning this system and finally got my numbers--it was difficult to work through
1, A Prophet Worth Turning: ........Jeffery Combs (The Frighteners
0, Flimsy and fills up fast: Disappointed when receiving this I asked where's the rest of it?. Not at all sturdy until DVD provide stability. Don't do it.
1, So funny
0, mislabeled film: This film is mislabeled by Amazon. It is NOT the film with Yamaguchi Momoe as indicated
0, An unforgiveable sin!: I LIKE Stuart Woods's books. This one is an engaging story
0," nonsense renewed: This book is not about ""a revolutionary psychotherapeutic treatment"" as advertised. It's a throwback to the nonsense beliefs of the Dark Ages. Demon possession??? Give me a break! A past life affecting present behavior?? Impossible"
1, Great study guide and practice tests.: The Software accompanying this book was the closest ( other than Poweprep from ETS ) that I got to the actual test
0, Kindle version of naves topical bible: The kindle version of naves topical bible is not a good buy
0," Gallipoli-False History.: The Australian movie Gallipoli has a false and slanderous ending.No British officer ever ordered Australian troops to commit a suicidal dash against the Turks.This is false history.The movie's statement that quote-""the British troops are relaxing on the beach""unquote while Australian troops were dying is particularly slanderous when you consider that Britain lost more than twice as many troops at Gallipoli as Australia and New Zealand combined.Gallipoli continued the chip-on-the-shoulder mentality of Australian filmakers against Britain.I am Australian born to Australian parents so my opinion is impartial."
0, Wrong Region code.: Thought I was getting the movie in English--turned out to be Region 2 and is unplayable. Dummy me. Throwing it away and eating my money.
1, A great film: The film Gallipoli is a great film and should be seen by anyone who would like to learn about the harshness of war. Like any film
1, history: Ok film may not be very accurate
1, Unsung Classic: This film was best summarised in the year of its release when a movie critic whose opinion I respected wrote that he was not interested in the Oscar nominations of that year as Gallipoli was not amongst them.I have yet to meet anyone who was not deeply moved by this work. I have not before ( or since ) seen a movie that better illustrates the aching futility and waste of war.
0, The easiest way to sell books is by making outrageous claims: McKenna is one of the most misinformed writers I have ever read. He has no grasp on the evolutionary process. He makes assumptions on important subjects with little or no scientific evidence. I'm not complaining that he tries to qualify the use of hallucinogens
1, Disrectangular is beautiful!: Rick Risch is one of the undiscovered geniuses of the music world. His lyrics are poignant
1, James Carter is amazing: This album is amazing in many aspects
0," Smells Very Funny - Not Fresh: When the product description said ""unboxed"" - I did not think that meant it would also not smell like the fragrance of Beautiful.I gave it 2 stars for arriving fairly quickly.Bad product choice if you want the real deal.Too much of a hassle to return - but a terrible product."
0, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!: DO NOT BE FOOLED WITH THE TITLE OR DESCRIPTION OF THIS DVD. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE F-16!!!!! IN FACT
1, A great book...: 2015: Peace on Earth is not very peaceful. The Southlands are being ruled by the xenophobic Field Marshal
1, Top Notch Groovin' Noir Jazz: This is one of my favorite recordings. Without a doubt
1," GRANT GREEN'S ""MYSTERY ALBUM"": This is an excellent soul jazz session from Grant Green"
1, A very nice brush and beautful too.: I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she and I were both very pleased. This is an excellent-quality brush that looks great and performs well
0, This chair should not be on the market.: If you're looking for a chair which will last between a week and a month then this chair is for you. After only a month of use by my 120 pound frame I managed to break the back of this chair almost completely. The remainder of the chair is fairly solid
1, This book is so real-it's kinda scary.: This book is not hiding anything. Even the sexual content is realistic. It's about strange and confusing world of love with 2 kids that live in different worlds but come together to share there love. I recommend this book to older teens and adults.
0, WRONG CHOICE!: Acting Sucked and NO PLOT! The Title should have been enough for me to over look this movie. It Sucked!
0, tman: This movie was not what I expected to see
1, Oh
0, For what I paid...: For what I paid for these headphones
1, Very Impressed: I am very impressed with the Koss MV1 headphones. The sound quality is excellent and the price is reasonable.
1, A little give and take: The Koss sound quality is there as it should be. The phones are not as heavy as the Pro 4 AA Phones I have used for years which is a plus for those who wear headsets for long periods of time. They still get warm and a bit sweaty after a while like the Pro 4 AA
0, avoid the e-book: Terrific book--but the Kindle version is full on typographical errors-including misspelled names
1, True leadership in toUgh times: Reading Kearn's biography of FDR and Eleanor R was a lesson in leadership and duty in the toughest of times. It would be wonderful to apply these lessons today.
1, Colors of the Day: Judy Collins has a spectacular voice and the selections in Colors of the Day show it off beautifully. I have loved listening to this album since it first came out as an LP
0, not worth the money: A very thin book with unrelated pictures
1, A Classic
0, Get a text with complete modernization of spelling: I am new to literature of this period and would be enjoying the text much more if modern spellings had been used. I find it frustrating not being able to look up unknown words in a dictionary.
1," Attack pilots in the Navy watch this film: My brother was a 23 year Navy pilot and was always struck by the fact that he said that A6 and F-18 pilots were ""required"" to watch this film. How can a mixture of jets and Grace Kelly go wrong? Excellent flick and a must of any aviation movie buff."
0, Didn't care for this classic...: I thought I would like this one. My wife's uncle as actually on-board the aircraft carrier when the filming was done. Unfortunately
0," Don't Buy It!: Don't waste your money on ""Listen and Learn French"" - the ""teacher"" actually sounds like an old voice over from the 50's or 60's (and sounds kind of angry). I couldn't listen for more than 10 minutes - no value added. Spend the extra couple bucks for Drive Time French - those cd's are awesome!"
1, amazing story: very awesome story of the resilience of a child and the dedication a those who worked to save her....recommend this read!
1," ""Lenny in Retrospect"": Leonard Bernstein is perhaps one of the greatest men to stand on any podium"
1, Wonderful OshKosh B'Gosh Lamp Shade: Simple yet effective and pleasing
0, Feliway electric diffuser (48 ml): I purchased this for my skittish cat. She didn't really respond to it. My big problem with this product is that it is supposed to last a month
1, A smart celebration: Even if these Jazz-hip-hoppers can be relegated at times to a dismissive jam-band background category in the way they play
1, Interesting plot line.: I enjoyed the film. I am a big Michael Pare fan. I believe he is an underrated actor. I can't understand why he didnt get more recognition.
0, ok for 1984: This movie prolly was good back in 1984 but watching it for the first in 2013 leaves a lot to be desired.
0, was expecting more: This was a disappointment for the beginning
0, Disappointed: It had an interesting story line
1, The Philadelphia Experiment: I have seen this movie many times over the years and was unhappy that it was not close captioned. I recently lost my hearing and had to struggle to remember the dialogue.
1, amazing piece of art: Neat book that reminds me of why books are such a lost art. The visual entertainment here is awesome!
0, A bit of a dissapointment...: Although not a waste of money (time) this book left me flat. The cover gave me the hope of something unique and strange - and my expectation was that the graphics and pop-ups would follow suit.This was not the case.It was mundane and pedestrian in concept and delivery.
0, No introduction needed: This version of Geronimo's autobiography includes a 33 page introduction by Frederick Turner. The introduction nothing more than an insight into Mr. Turner's personal prejudices. I can only assume that someone with such strong biases will be unable to prevent them from affecting his editing. My interest was in reading Geronimo's words and not after they have been filtered by someone with an obvious agenda. I am a student of History and not

1, My Review on Kirkus's Review: The review written by Kirkus is a very interesting review. He summarized the story very well with many good discriptions. His review was about how the story portrayed itself and how Harry overcame his opsticles. The begining of his review was about how the novel was an award-winning one in England. He says also that it's toward an action-oriented readers. He gives the description of the story vey well and still manages to get readers to read it. Also leaving out important parts and most important the ending! I think Kirkus wrote a very intelligent review and it deserves prase.
0, Go for the paperback: Sadly disappointed by this book. Everyone who'd be interested in a collector's edition will already know the story
0, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE: HE LIVE WITH ANUT THEY LOCK HIM IN THE CUPBARD IF HE WAS BAD. HE KEPT GETTING LETTER FROM SOMEONE BUT HARRY WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS WRITTING TO HIM.BUT HIS ANUT WOULDN'T LET HIM HAVE IT.

0, Give me a break with pottermore: I guess that the 20 minutes it takes and the separate pottermore account that needs to be created would only be tolerated because it is Harry Potter after all. One cannot really blame Amazon though since it seems to be some type of Torture inspired by Sony.

1, Harry Potter -- Chamber of Secrets: Speaking as a mother of a child you hated to read. I love the Harry Potter series and will reccommend it to anyone who has a child that does not like to read. My son would always complain when I would tell him to turn the TV off and pick up a book.I bought the book to read with him and his sister then his teacher started reading it to the class. He then got so engrossed in the book that he started reading it on his own.My son now goes to bed early so that he can read for 30 minutes. He is actually turning the TV off and picking up the book. I now have to tell him to put the book down and go outside for some air.He is about finished with the second book and impaitently waiting for me to buy him the third book so that he can start on it. Thank you J.K. Rowling.
